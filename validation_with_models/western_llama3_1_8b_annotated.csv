1,Masses gather at India flashpoint site,"Tens of thousands of Hindus, including monks and right-wing activists, are descending on the flashpoint Indian religious site of Ayodhya.The northern city has been a key point of tension between Hindus and Muslims.In the past few months, there have been renewed calls to build a temple on the spot, where a 16th Century mosque was demolished by Hindu mobs in 1992.The BBC explains why the holy site is back in the news:Between 100,000 and 200,000 Hindus are expected to gather at Ayodhya on Sunday, demanding that a Hindu temple be built where the 16th Century Babri mosque once stood.Hindus believe the religious site in the state of Uttar Pradesh is the birthplace of one of their most revered deities, Lord Ram. But Muslims say they have worshipped there for generations.Tensions between the two communities came to a violent head in 1992 when a Hindu mob destroyed the mosque.Nearly 2,000 people were killed in subsequent riots across the country.But now, after various attempts to claim ownership over the land by both religious groups, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has been scaling up efforts to build a Hindu temple there.The crowds who are expected to gather at the site are from various hardline right-wing groups, including the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) and Shiv Sena.Local media reports say that walls in districts surrounding the site have been plastered with posters that show Lord Ram going to war. Others contain slogans that are essentially war cries against what they call the inability by previous governments to get the temple constructed.The situation has prompted a sense of panic and fear among Ayodhya's Muslim residents, many of whom have plans to leave the area before the crowds descend.""This is the biggest build-up in favour of a temple since the mosque was destroyed. They are provoking the public. They are stirring up emotions,"" Ahmad, a Muslim community leader, told the Reuters news agency.The call for the construction of a Hindu temple in Ayodhya has grown particularly loud in the last few months and has mostly come from MPs, ministers and leaders from the BJP.Uttar Pradesh, India's most populous state, sends more MPs to parliament than any other state. A big win in the state is essential for any party hoping to form the next government.Correspondents say the BJP appears to be attempting to galvanise Hindus in Uttar Pradesh along religious lines once again. The party's strategy paid off in 2014, when it managed to win 71 of the state's 80 seats.The BJP's projection of a united Hindu identity that superseded caste and class divisions and positioned them against those from ""other"" religions, is largely seen as having been responsible for that performance.This same momentum helped the party sweep state elections last year. But since that victory, and the instalment of the controversial Hindu hardliner Yogi Adityanath as chief minister, the BJP has lost several key local elections.One was a parliamentary by-election in Mr Adityanath's home constituency. Analysts say this could be due to a number of reasons, including farmers who are unhappy with the government after being badly affected by drought and declining productivity.The BJP may see Ayodhya as offering a way of reversing this trend.Hindus and Muslims have been at loggerheads over the Babri mosque for more than 100 years.Hindus say the site is the birthplace of Lord Ram, and insist the Babri mosque was built there only after Muslim invaders destroyed a Hindu temple that stood there first.Muslims claim they offered prayers at the mosque until December 1949 when some Hindus placed idols of Ram in the mosque and began to worship the idols.Over the decades since, the two religious groups have gone to court many times over who should control the site.The Supreme Court, which is hearing a batch of pleas about the disputed site, has deferred its next hearing until January 2019.But there have been several interesting legal landmarks so far.In 2010, the Allahabad High Court said that the main site where the mosque stood should be split into three parts, with two-thirds given to Hindus and one-third to Muslims.The ruling also marked the first time any court had acknowledged the disputed site as the birthplace of Lord Ram.In 2011 the Supreme Court suspended this ruling after both Hindu and Muslim groups appealed. Since then, some 14 civil petitions have also challenged it.But another judgement worth noting is one from 1994 when the Supreme Court, which was ruling on a wholly separate case at the time, remarked that the mosque was ""not integral to Islam"".This particular line has bolstered the case made by Hindus who want control of the entire site.In April 2018, a senior lawyer named Rajeev Dhavan filed a plea before the top court, asking judges to reconsider this observation.But a few months later the Supreme Court declined to do so.As recently as last month, the same court rejected an urgent hearing into the civil petitions. ""We have other priorities,"" chief justice Ranjan Gogoi said, adding that the matter would be taken up early next year.Ever since the Narendra Modi-led Hindu nationalist BJP came to power in 2014, India has seen deepening social and religious divisions.Rabble-rousing by hardline ministers and Hindu groups has led to what many call greater anxiety in social relations.Restrictions on the sale and slaughter of cows - considered a holy animal by the majority Hindus - have led to vigilante killings of more than 20 people, most of them Muslims who were transporting cattle.An uninhibited display of muscular Hindu nationalism has also contributed to religious tension.The recent revival of the demand by some Hindu groups to construct the temple at Ayodhya through executive fiat - ignoring proceedings in the Supreme Court - is seen by many a renewed attempt to polarise the voters on religious lines ahead of the crucial 2019 elections.",Ayodhya Ram Mandir,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-46318505,BBC,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""framing"", ""reason"": ""The article frames the issue as a Hindu nationalist movement to build a temple at Ayodhya, emphasizing the role of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's BJP and highlighting tensions between Hindus and Muslims.

2,The neglected shrines of India's grand temple town,"India's Uttar Pradesh state is voting for a new government - and a massive temple under construction in the holy city of Ayodhya is a key election issue.The governing Bharatiya Janata Party - which is also in power in Uttar Pradesh - has long campaigned for the shrine to be built on the site where a medieval mosque was torn down by Hindu mobs in 1992. They believe it was built on the ruins of a temple dedicated to Lord Ram, and that Ayodhya is his birthplace.As money and attention flows to the new Ram temple, thousands of locals whose livelihoods depend on the city's numerous other shrines are wary.They fear that their jobs could disappear as older, decrepit shrines are demolished or sidelined as part of the government's ambitious plan to turn Ayodhya into a tourist hub.Video by Nitin Srivastava and Neha Sharma",Ayodhya Ram Mandir,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-60431188,BBC,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""framing"", ""reason"": ""The article frames the issue of the Ayodhya Ram Mandir as a conflict between the new temple and 'thousands of locals whose livelihoods depend on the city's numerous other shrines', implying that the government's plan is "", ""confidence"": 0.8}",yes,framing,"Frames one side with "" medieval mosque was torn down by Hindu mobs in 1992"" and as anti to local people completely."
3,The Hindu epic causing a political storm in India,"A 16th-Century epic poem based on the life of popular Hindu god Ram is at the centre of a huge political row in India.Ramcharitmanas is counted by many scholars to be among the world's greatest literary creations. Celebrated author Pavan Varma calls it ""a deeply philosophical work"" which ""is akin to the Bible for many Hindus"".Composed by Tulsidas, the poem is a retelling of Ramayana, the Sanskrit epic written by Hindu sage Valmiki 2,500 years ago. It's widely believed that Tulsidas's version, which is written in Awadhi - a dialect very similar to Hindi - is what made Ram's story accessible to the masses and why it became so popular.The story of the crown prince of Ayodhya and his victory over the demon king Ravana is performed every year during the Dussehra festival across India. He is a god who's revered by millions of Hindus for his sense of justice and fair play.But in the past few weeks, politicians on opposing sides have been arguing over whether the text is derogatory towards women as well as Dalits, who are at the bottom of India's deeply discriminatory caste system.This is not the first time Tulsidas's epic, written more than 600 years ago, has been criticised, but what sets it apart this time is the scale of protests by both its supporters and critics. General elections in India are due in a year and politicians from both sides accuse each other of using the controversy over the book to polarise voters along caste lines.Since January, protesters have burned pages allegedly containing excerpts from the book - and counter-protests have been held, demanding critics of the work be arrested.At least five people, accused of desecrating the sacred text, have been arrested and, at the weekend, police invoked the National Security Act (NSA), a draconian law that makes bail nearly impossible, against two of the arrested men.Trouble started in January when a minister in the northern state of Bihar said the book was ""spreading hatred in society"". At a gathering of university students, Education Minister Chandrashekhar (who uses only one name) recited a few lines from Ramcharitmanas to prove his point.""It says that if people from lower castes receive education, they become poisonous, like a snake becomes after drinking milk,"" he said.A few days later, Swami Prasad Maurya, a prominent leader of a socially-disadvantaged community known as Other Backward Classes (OBC) and a member of the regional Samajwadi Party in Uttar Pradesh state, expressed similar sentiments.Insisting that some verses of Ramcharitmanas were ""offensive"", he demanded that they be removed from the book.""Why hurl abuse in the name of religion? I respect all religions. But if in the name of religion, a community or caste is humiliated then it is objectionable,"" The Indian Express quoted him as saying.On Wednesday, he tweeted a letter he's written to the prime minister and the president of India, asking them to ""remove the objectionable comments, which are abusive and insulting towards women, tribals, Dalits and backwards"".The comments by Mr Chandrasekhar, whose Rashtriya Janata Dal party governs Bihar, and Mr Maurya set off a political firestorm with Hindu nationalist groups, including members from India's governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) criticising them.BJP politician Nandkishore Gurjar said he had written to the Supreme Court demanding the death penalty for Mr Maurya. In the temple town of Ayodhya a prominent Hindu seer demanded the Bihar minister apologise and be sacked.In Uttar Pradesh, protesters burnt effigies of Mr Maurya and lodged a police complaint, demanding his arrest.Soon, groups supporting Mr Maurya also joined in. At a protest by members of the Akhil Bharatiya OBC Mahasabha in his support in the city of Lucknow, some pages containing excerpts from Ramcharitmanas were burned - the five men who were arrested had participated in this protest.The controversy has also renewed a debate around Ramcharitmanas and whether the criticism has any merit in a country where the constitution sets out that all Indians are equal.Feminists have decried it over the years, especially lines that say that ""a drum, an uneducated man, a Dalit and a woman, all need to be beaten or reprimanded"".Prof Hemlata Mahishwar of Delhi's Jamia University told BBC Hindi that ""it's not just one or two lines but there are several verses"" in Ramcharitmanas that are derogatory to women and Dalits.""There's one couplet that says that a Brahmin is to be worshipped even if he's full of bad qualities. Whereas a Dalit, even if he's a Vedic scholar, cannot be respected. So how can we accept a book that's so biased?""Some experts, however, say that Tulsidas was not a reformer and did have his biases, but the controversial lines are spoken by his characters and can't be taken to be a reflection of the author's opinion.Akhilesh Shandilya, an expert on Ramcharitmanas, told BBC Hindi that the lines appear derogatory to Dalits and anti-women only when taken out of context and read in isolation.But critics say that Ramcharitmanas has to be approached in the present-day context and deserves scrutiny and discussion, especially as it is a book that has such a hold on the imagination of Indians.",Ayodhya Ram Mandir,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-64556116,BBC,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""labeling"", ""reason"": ""Loaded labels/titles (e.g., 'Hindu nationalist groups', 'feminists') applied asymmetrically or without parity across actors."", ""confidence"": 0.8}",no,None,"This article covers factually about both the sides and thelabels like 'Hindu nationalist groups', 'feminists' are not asymmetric here"
4,The ancient epic dominating India's election,"With the Indian general election under way, the Ramayana, a 2,500-year-old Hindu mythological epic, is back in the spotlight. The BBC's religious affairs reporter Priyanka Pathak explains why.This year, like in previous elections, the conversation among many hardline Hindus has returned to the epic Ramayana and its protagonist, Ram.A longstanding demand to construct a temple in the northern city of Ayodhya - a key point of tension between Hindus and Muslims - which Hindus believe is Ram's birthplace, has become louder in recent months.Hardline Hindus want the temple built on the same spot where a 16th Century mosque was demolished by Hindu mobs in 1992. They believe the Babri mosque was built after the destruction of a Hindu temple by a Muslim invader.India's Ayodhya site: Masses gather as Hindu-Muslim dispute simmersThe governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has promised, once again, to reconstruct the Ram Mandir (temple) in its election manifesto.Like in previous elections, they hope that this pledge will draw in more Hindu voters. They also organised Hindu religious festivals on a grand scale in the lead-up to the polls.On 12 April, a large gathering of right-wing organisations was held at the iconic Ram Lila Maidan, a sprawling ground named after the god in the centre of the capital, Delhi, to celebrate ""Ram's birthday"".People dressed in saffron robes wielded swords as they chanted ""Jai Shree Ram"", which translates from the Hindi to ""Hail Lord Ram"". They shouted slogans, reiterating their promise to Ram that they would reconstruct the temple.Experts believe that the movement to build the temple, spearheaded by a powerful Hindu nationalist organisation called the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), has helped craft some sort of a collective Hindu identity in India.This idea is something that the RSS, the ideological fountainhead of the BJP, has cultivated since the early 20th Century.However, the movement found its zeitgeist moment only a century later.Several things happened almost concurrently during the late 1980s. First, a television show on the epic reminded 80 million viewers of the story and rekindled a love for its hero.The serial broadcast a standardised story of the Ramayana, pulled together from many versions and variants. There is no official version of this sprawling epic although historical scholars consider the version by Valmiki, a sage and Sanskrit poet, to be the most authentic.But really there are as many as 3,000 retellings of the story in around 22 languages, including some that eulogise Ravana while others say it was actually Ram's brother Lakshman who killed the demon king.But what the television show did was give India a single narrative of the Ramayana. It also gave a single religion to a country ""that was diverse and plural and included many different ways to be Indian"", says Arshia Sattar, a doctorate in south Asian languages, who has translated Valmiki's Ramayana from Sanskrit into English.The second big moment came in the late 1980s, when the Congress party led by Rajiv Gandhi - which has always styled itself as secular - decided to lay the foundation stone of the temple in Ayodhya with the help of Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP), a right-wing outfit, to woo Hindu votes in a close election.The plan didn't work - instead, it paved the way for the BJP, still a young party at the time, to seize what they saw as an opportunity to galvanise Hindu voters.In September 1989, the party's then president LK Advani launched a nationwide march for the temple. Bricks began to move from around India for the construction of the temple. The campaign was successful in mobilising communal sentiments and set in motion a series of events that would result in the demolition of the mosque. This, in turn, triggered nationwide riots.But in the next elections, the BJP swept the polls. From that moment forward, the party - which was 12 years old at the time - became a national heavyweight.It took its place as either the party leading the ruling government alliance or as the leading opposition party. For the BJP, the Ayodhya issue became a way to consolidate Hindu votes - something that used to be fragmented along caste lines.This now well-known version of the epic, championing Ram, also became a convenient point for other Hindu organisations to rally around. This meant that other versions of the epic began to be stamped out.For instance, in 2011, a Hindu nationalist student union and other affiliated right-wing groups succeeded in forcing Delhi University to drop an essay by   the late poet and Ramayana scholar AK Ramanujan, which questioned how many versions of the epic existed, from its history curriculum.""This may have been part of the general climate of intolerance and the battle over who had the right to tell the country's history and its myths that was part of the Indian landscape between the 1980s and the 2000s,"" literary critic and author Nilanjana Roy wrote of the incident in her blog in 2011.But for hardline Hindus, the cultural loss of other versions is simply collateral damage.They believe that a sort of Hindu renaissance can be built around the epic, allowing Hindus to band together and revive their religion as a way of life that they believe was lost and can be re-established.For instance, in September 2017, the Uttarakhand state minister for alternative medicine, proposed spending $3.6m (£2.8m) to find Sanjeevani -  a mythical, glow-in-the-dark herb, described in the epic as having saved Ram and Lakshman from certain death.The deputy chief minister of Uttar Pradesh has also suggested that science was so advanced during the time of the Ramayana that Sita was actually a test-tube baby. And the vice chancellor of an Indian university has claimed that Ravana, had a fleet of airplanes.A series of such examples from Indian politicians and scholars can be seen as an attempt to bolster pride in the mythological epic. But they also evoke a nostalgia for a grand past, reawakening hope for a future that repeats the great feats of distance ancestors.",Ayodhya Ram Mandir,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-47944411,BBC,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""framing"", ""reason"": ""The article frames the Ramayana and Ayodhya temple issue as a Hindu nationalist movement, emphasizing its impact on Indian politics and elections.

5,Temple rises from ruins of one of India’s darkest days,"Santosh Dubey says he has no regrets he helped tear down the mosque.""It was religious work and I was put on this Earth to complete the task,"" he says. ""There is no crime or sin in it.""Mr Dubey, a ""kar sevak"" (religious worker), was one of tens of thousands of Hindu men who demolished the 16th Century Babri Masjid in the Indian holy city of Ayodhya on 6 December 1992.It was one of independent India's darkest days. The disputed site sits on one of its biggest religious fault-lines - thousands were killed in the violence that broke out.More than 30 years later, where the mosque once stood a grand temple to Lord Ram, one of Hinduism's most revered deities, is about to be opened by India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi. That's controversial in a country with a secular constitution, but especially so because of the divisive history of the site.Monday's ceremony is being seen as the informal start of his campaign for re-election this year, wooing India's Hindu majority. Across the country, millions of Hindus are gearing up to celebrate the day like a big festival, while employees of Mr Modi's federal government have been given a half day.Sitting in his crumbling home, in a narrow alley in the city, paint and plaster peeling off its walls, Mr Dubey says he's proud of what he achieved.""If we had not done what we did then the temple could never have been built,"" he says. ""Religious sentiments are greater than the constitution. I am extremely happy now. I had taken a pledge that I would not repair my home until Lord Ram got his.""But for Muslims, who make up India's biggest minority, the day will evoke fear and painful memories. Some will send their children out of the city, fearing tensions might be stoked when the streets fill with Hindu devotees from around the country.""We have been betrayed once, so we feel fear,"" says Mohammad Shahid. ""Many outsiders will come into Ayodhya and it's when outsiders come that there's trouble.""6 December 1992 was a defining moment in India's history. It was also a pivotal event in the political rise of the Hindu right-wing that's now seeking a third consecutive term in power.Many Hindus believe Muslim emperor Babur destroyed a temple that stood at the birthplace of Lord Ram and built a mosque over it more than 500 years ago.Santosh Dubey and dozens of others have faced charges and spent time in jail over the years, but no-one has been convicted for demolishing the mosque.He doesn't agree that what he did was against the law.""Those who say that it was not Hindu to destroy the mosque are idiots. They are heretics, leftists, extremists and terrorists.""We did not go to another country to destroy their places of worship, but if they destroyed ours, then it is right that we get them back.""Muslims regularly offered prayers in the mosque until 1949, when idols of Lord Ram were placed in it, allegedly by Hindu priests. The gates of the mosque were then closed by a court order. In 1986, they were re-opened, many believe at the behest of the Congress party, then in power, in a rumoured attempt to woo the Hindu majority.Then in 1990, the Hindu Nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) - then just a small political party with little electoral success - spearheaded a mass campaign for a Hindu temple at the site. The campaign would later be seen as one of the key moments which transformed BJP into the virtually unbeatable political giant it is today, which now has Mr Modi at its head.That year, tens of thousands of kar sevaks congregated in Ayodhya. When they started moving towards the disputed site, police fired at them, killing dozens. ""Those bullets fuelled our anger,"" Santosh Dubey says. He was injured in the shooting.Two years later, kar sevaks gathered in Ayodhya again.""The people who were guarding the disputed structure fled when they saw a huge crowd walking towards them with swords and hammers. We had practised everything earlier. We climbed on the domes and brought it down within a few hours.""Mr Dubey shows us a black and white photo that appeared in a newspaper of a group of men brandishing their weapons with raised arms, wide smiles on their faces. He says it was taken before the mosque was razed.""We were happy, because we knew what was going to happen that day,"" he says, pointing to himself in the photo.For Ayodhya's Muslims it was a day of terror.""Hundreds of thousands of men were all over Ayodhya. They had sticks, swords and tridents. Our house was surrounded by them,"" says Anwari Begum, now 65.""We ran from our homes. I ran with my six-month-old baby and small children. My husband was running behind us. When I turned, I saw that he had been caught by some men. We had to keep running for our lives.""The next day she found out her husband Mohammad Amin had been killed, one of at least 17 Muslims who died in shocking violence in Ayodhya that day.""An eyewitness told us that he had been caught, his arms and legs were chopped off, he was dumped into a sack and taken away. We never found his body,"" she says breaking down.When she returned to her home, she found it had been burnt to the ground. It would take time, but over the years the family would manage to rebuild a small, two-room home on the same site.""My husband used to take care of our family. I was left alone with six small children. We got some money from the government but it was not enough. My life was destroyed by that day,"" she says.In the violence that swept across India after the mosque was torn down, nearly 2,000 people were killed. More than 900 died in the financial capital, Mumbai, alone, roughly two-thirds of them were Muslims.  There were killings in other cities including Jaipur, Bhopal, Ahmedabad and Hyderabad.In Ayodhya, Mohammad Shahid's father Mohammad Sabir was also killed brutally.""They beat him and then they poured oil on both him and my uncle and set them on fire. We found their bodies,"" he says. ""The country wants to forget what happened. But Muslims can never forget. It was a black day for us.""The family had a business supplying wooden carvings to temples in Ayodhya. The workshop was razed to the ground, and Mr Shahid was forced to become a rickshaw driver to earn a living.Like Mr Shahid, Anwari Begum wants her son Sohrab, who's in his 30s, to leave for his safety around the inauguration.""I'm not scared, but I am nervous,"" he told the BBC. ""It's being said that 70,000 to 100,000 people are coming. The atmosphere could become charged, that's why Muslims are thinking of leaving. But I won't go. I don't think anything will happen.""In Ayodhya, the temple site is abuzz with cranes and diggers sending dust into the air ahead of the inauguration. Thousands of workers in hard hats dot the area.It's costing $217m (£170m) to build the temple, funded from private donations, the temple trust says. The makeover of the city is being done by the government, estimated to cost more than $3bn.Amid the construction, hundreds and hundreds of proud worshippers stream in to get a glimpse of the idols, with rituals for their consecration in the new temple already under way.Poonam Ohri, 40, had tears of joy rolling down her cheeks. ""Our dream has come true because of Modi and the BJP government. I am overwhelmed.""Badri Narayan, an elderly farmer who had travelled hundreds of miles, said his happiness knew no bounds.""When I visited before, Lord Ram's idol was in a makeshift tent. It was getting wet in the rain. Tears started falling from my eyes seeing that,"" he told the BBC. ""And now he has been released because of Modi.""Prime Minister Modi has asked people not to come to Ayodhya on 22 January and to light a lamp in their homes. But he's also said everyone can visit from the next day.And it is those days following the official ceremony which worry some in the Muslim community.""If the government reached out to us and gave assurances that nothing will happen, that would prevent people from leaving, but so far they haven't done that,"" said Azam Qadri, a Muslim community leader.Sohrab says ""political leaders should have come to us and said what happened to you was wrong - they should have showed compassion, but they have not"".As for the new temple that's being opened, he says: ""We feel happy they are building their temple, but we are also sad because it was built after destroying a mosque.""Mohammad Shahid says Hindus have the right to build the temple after the Supreme Court gave them the site. ""We did not accept that decision happily, but what can we do,"" he says.After years in the courts, the disputed site was handed over to Hindus by a Supreme Court judgment in 2019, despite the judges also finding that the mosque's demolition had been illegal. The ruling relied on archaeological evidence which showed that features of the foundations of the mosque ""are suggestive of a Hindu religious origin"".It also said that evidence placed on the record proved that there was Hindu faith and belief that the site was the birthplace of Ram.It was not proved that a temple had been destroyed to build the mosque.The court also ordered a separate plot be given to Muslims to construct a mosque. It's 15 miles from Ayodhya, overgrown and empty.It is simply too far away, says Mr Qadri: ""If the government had given it as much attention by building roads and ring roads as it's doing for the temple, then work would have started there too.""Prime Minister Modi and the BJP are expected to sweep the general election later this year following the inauguration of the temple.Many accuse him and his party of violating the constitution, of turning a religious event into a state-sponsored one.But the BJP's local MP, Lallu Singh, saw no reason why Mr Modi shouldn't attend.""If the prime minister is Hindu, why should he not visit the biggest centre of Hindu faith? What should stop him? Lord Ram is representative of the culture of this country,"" he told the BBC.""The culture of the majority dominates the country, so it is 100% right that the PM do the opening. This does not mean we are discriminating on the basis of religion.""There is also controversy around moving the idols into an unfinished temple, with some Hindu religious leaders accusing the government of prioritising electoral gains over the sanctity of Hindu rituals.""I don't want to comment on what our religious leaders say. But the sanctum sanctorum where the idol will sit is complete. More worshippers will be able to come with ease now, that's why we are opening it,"" the MP says.Back in 1992, the BJP's senior leaders expressed regret over the demolition of the mosque and said it should never have happened. How does Lallu Singh feel about it now?""I believe what happened was right,"" he says.Most Muslims and Hindus the BBC spoke to don't think longer-term there will be more hostilities in Ayodhya.But some see Ayodhya as just the start - disputes and court cases are already ongoing over mosques in the cities of Mathura and Varanasi, referred to many by its ancient name Kashi.""We had to wait for 450 years to get the birthplace of Lord Ram. I hope Kashi and Mathura will be ours soon too,"" says Aakash Jadhav, a 21-year-old Hindu devotee.",Ayodhya Ram Mandir,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-68030712,BBC,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""framing"", ""reason"": ""The article frames the demolition of the mosque as a 'defining moment in India's history' and portrays the Hindu right-wing as seeking to reclaim their heritage, while downplaying or omitting the violence and harm caused"", ""confidence"": 0.8}",yes,framing,"Terms like ' tens of thousands of Hindu men who demolished the 16th Century Babri Masjid' , 'defining moment in India's history', are used."

9,The TV show that transformed Hinduism,"During 1987 and 1988, Indian state TV broadcast a series that adapted the epic Hindu poem the Ramayana for a modern audience. Some believe this set the path for a national Hindu consciousness, writes Rahul Verma.As a teenager growing up in late-1980s London, visits to New Delhi to see my extended family were like stepping into another world. On those trips, I’d swap Batman comics for Amar Chitra Katha comic books, depicting wondrous Hindu mythology; cans of cherry coke for glass bottles of Campa Cola; and four terrestrial TV channels for one, Doordarshan.Whereas in London I had to pester my parents to watch Neighbours and EastEnders, in Delhi they insisted I join them, my grandparents, aunt, uncle and cousins to watch the Ramayan. Ramanand Sagar’s TV adaptation of the epic Hindu poem the Ramayana tells the story of crown prince, Lord Ram, who is banished into exile for 14 years, and must rescue his kidnapped wife Sita from the clutches of a ten-headed demon.More like this:- The show like nothing else on TV- The Indian Handmaid’s Tale- What this historical TV show reveals about China todayThe victory of light over dark and Lord Ram’s return home to the kingdom of Ayodhya is the basis of Diwali, the festival of light celebrated by Hindus, Sikhs and Jains, that also marks New Year for some communities. In the run-up to Diwali (this year on 27 October), Ramlilas – folk plays of the Ramayana – are performed in schools, halls, markets, and on street corners, in cities, towns and villages, just as the nativity is celebrated before Christmas among Christian communities.Over the course of 18 months in 1987 and 1988, Sagar’s telling of the epic through 78 weekly 45-minute episodes – broadcast on Sunday mornings on India’s only TV channel, Doordarshan –  became the most successful TV show in Indian history, with popular episodes watched by a staggering 80 million to 100 million people, an eighth of the population.The Ramayana’s special place in India’s cultural memory explains why the TV series became a phenomenon, but no one could have predicted that the Ramayan would become a participatory, weekly act of devotion. As Arvind Rajagopal, professor of media studies at NYU and author of the book Politics After Television, explains, in cities across northern India public life ground to a halt. “Trains would stop at stations, buses would stop, and passengers would disembark to find a roadside place with a TV – the crowds were so big, people would be unable to see or hear the TV but the point was about being present, being there.”Screen worshipThe BBC’s Delhi correspondent Soutik Biswas wrote in 2011: “I remember the soap nearly shutting down India on Sunday mornings in the mid-1980s – streets would be deserted, shops would be closed and people would bathe, and garland their TV sets before the serial began.”Sunday mornings were the highlight of my grandmother’s week: before the broadcast, she would burn incense and perform pooja (prayer ritual) in the home shrine, before sitting on the floor, barefoot and covering her head with a chunni, to watch the show, along with three generations of family.My grandmother’s rituals mirrored temple conventions and the series brought the temple experience of darshan – visual communion – into homes and public spaces where it was screened. While in a Hindu temple setting, darshan is about worshippers gazing at statues of gods, with the Ramayan, Hindus were able to visually commune with Hindu gods (Ram, Laxman, Sita, Hanuman) via the TV. “It was absolutely like going to the temple – people would do pooja before the show, put garlands and tikka (red marks) on the TV; that was the kind of feeling people had for the show,” explains the actor Arun Govil, who played Lord Ram.The show changed Govil’s life. “Wherever I went people wanted to touch my feet and touch me, there was so much adulation and admiration, people would start crying out of happiness. I have a newspaper clipping of when I visited Varanasi in my costume: the headline says ‘One Million People Gather to Look At Lord Ram’,” he recalls.‘Ramayan Fever’ gripped the nation. On Sunday, August 7, 1988, one week after the series finished, journalist Shailaja Bajpai wrote in the Indian Express (p16): “Never before, and maybe never again, will there be another quite like it. From Kanyakumari to Kashmir, from Gujarat to Gorakhpur, millions have stood, sat and kneeled to watch it. Millions more have fought, shoved and keeled over, watching it.”The TV show is credited as the catalyst in sparking a Hindu awakening across India, and bringing Hindu nationalism to the forefront of public and political spheres. Until the Ramayan was broadcast, religious TV programming was limited because India is a secular state, with all religions treated equally, as Rajagopal explains. “The broadcast of the Ramayana was the first major rupture of the secular consensus, it catered to the devout and ritualistic. The popular response was devotional, but the activity of political parties was necessary to translate that into something political.”In a 2000 interview with India’s Frontline magazine, Rajagopal said that when the Indian government began broadcasting the Ramayan to nationwide audiences, “This violated a decades-old taboo on religious partisanship, and Hindu nationalists made the most of the opportunity. What resulted was perhaps the largest campaign in post-Independence times, irrevocably changing the complexion of Indian politics. The telecast of a religious epic to popular acclaim created the sense of a nation coming together, seeming to confirm the idea of Hindu awakening.”While it was the Congress government of the time that sought to capture Hindu votes by broadcasting the Ramayan on state TV channel Doordarshan, it is the Hindu nationalist party, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), that has reaped the benefits. The BJP, currently led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, convincingly won general elections in India in 2014 and 2019, and led coalition governments from 1998 to 2004.Holy landDuring and after the Ramayan’s broadcast, the Sangh Parivar (family of Hindu nationalist organisations), spotted the chance to capitalise on a Hindu awakening and construct a national Hindu consciousness, as well as unifying diverse Hindu groups and establishing the idea of a golden era of Hindu rule – ‘Ram Rajya’ or Kingdom of Ram. During the series’ transmission there was a controversy over a mosque, the Babri Masjid, in the city of Ayodhya – with Hindu nationalists claiming it was built on the site of Lord Ram’s birthplace.Hindu nationalists orchestrated a nationwide campaign, the Ram Janmabhoomi (meaning ‘Rama’s birthplace’) movement – dressing volunteers as Ram and Laxman from the TV series – calling on the construction of a Lord Ram temple in place of the mosque. Campaigns, including ‘Send a brick to Ayodhya’ and ‘Send a rupee’, enabled Hindus all over India – rich and poor – to contribute to the building of a Hindu temple, and forged a sense of Hindu togetherness.According to Rajagopal, the Ramayan TV series echoed this movement. “In one scene, Lord Ram reveals he’s carrying earth from his birthplace – this is not in any version of the Ramayana I’m aware of – and spoke to a specific political moment, the Ram Janmabhoomi movement. It’s an example of how the series reflected politics, and vice versa.”In December 1992, a rally organised by Hindu groups drew 150,000 people – some dressed as characters from the TV show – to march on the 16th-Century mosque in Ayodhya, to march on the 16th-Century mosque in Ayodhya, and violence erupted with mobs tearing down the mosque. Communal violence flared across the country, and the issue remains live, with India’s Supreme Court expected to hand down a ruling in the coming weeks on whether a mosque or temple, or both, should stand on the site.Today, metaphors and symbols from the TV series and epic are regular features of Indian politics – for example, the concept of the ‘Ram Rajya’ (‘a just and mighty Hindu kingdom’) is ever present, and Prime Minister Modi and BJP president Amit Shah are often referred to as Lord Ram and his brother Laxman. While the TV series is not responsible for this, it made a standard set of Hindu symbols available to all, and these state-sponsored symbols helped create the conditions for a Hindu redefinition of public and political life.“For Hindu nationalists, the long-held desire has been to establish a devout Hindu character, and through rebuilding the character of the individual you rebuild the character of the nation,” says Rajagopal. “For decades it was believed that this would have to happen on the ground, from the bottom up; however with the opening up of the media landscape and TV they could do it symbolically, top-down rather than bottom-up.”Modern mythologyA 2018 article in The Hindustan Times reassessing the impact of the TV series argued that “Sagar’s Ramayana played in the backdrop of a Hindutva [Hindu nationalist] shift in Indian politics, under the aegis of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and its political outfit, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). While the media and cultural commentators struggled to consider Sagar’s epic one way or the other, there were some who saw it as a catalyst, even if unintended, to the turmoil that the movement resulted in.”And in many ways, the show’s influence extended beyond symbolism. According to the Hindustan Times article, “The political clout that the TV series came to hold can be adjudged by the fact that Arun Govil (who played Ram) and Sagar were repeatedly courted by both the Congress and the BJP to campaign for them. Other actors like Deepika Chikalia (Sita) and Arvind Trivedi (Ravana) both eventually became MPs.”What its makers claimed to be the ‘world’s most viewed mythological series’ helped to break TV as a mass phenomenon in India. It also showed that ancient Hinduism was compatible with modernity, ready for a new technological and consumer age, with India on the cusp of major market reform and economic liberalisation in the early 1990s.More than 30 years after the series ended, the Ramayan is still shaping the actor who starred as Lord Ram. “As an actor, the success wasn’t good for me as I was unable to get different roles. I was told, ‘Your image is so strong as Ram-ji.’ In the beginning that bothered me, but it depends on how you take it. I’m still remembered, loved and respected for that role,” says Govil, who is currently starring as Lord Ram in a stage show, The Legend of Ram. And, just as Govil continues to be defined by the Ramayan, so too is India.Love TV?

10,Indian Supreme Court ruling on Ayodhya dispute,"India's Supreme Court is due to make a long-awaited ruling on a disputed religious site in the northern holy city of Ayodhya.Hindus and Muslims have for decades been bitterly divided over the 16th Century Babri mosque site.The judges' decision is due shortly and is said to be unanimous.Officials have appealed for calm, and thousands of police and paramilitary troops have been deployed in the city in Uttar Pradesh state.Hundreds of people were detained on Friday amid fears of violence.The court case centres on the ownership of the land and has been dragging on in the Supreme Court for years.Hindus believe that the site of the mosque is the birthplace of one of their most revered deities, Lord Ram, and they want to build a temple there. Muslims, however, say they have worshipped there for generations.Schools and colleges in the area have been closed and all roads leading to the site have been blocked by police.Government departments say they have also made preparations to deal with any violence.""Each and every security officer is committed to prevent minor skirmishes or large-scale riots after the court delivers its verdict,"" said one senior home ministry official, who declined to be named.""State governments have identified several schools to set up temporary jails if the need arises.""On Twitter, Prime Minister Narendra Modi appealed for calm and urged everyone to respect the verdict.""Whatever the verdict... it won't be anybody's win or loss,"" he said.""My appeal to the people of India is that our priority is to ensure the verdict strengthens the values of peace, equality and goodwill of our country.""At the centre of the row is the 16th Century mosque that was demolished by Hindu mobs in 1992, sparking riots that killed nearly 2,000 people.Many Hindus believe that the Babri Masjid was constructed on the ruins of a Hindu temple that was demolished by Muslim invaders.Muslims say they offered prayers at the mosque until December 1949 when some Hindus placed an idol of Ram in the mosque and began to worship the idols.Over the decades since, the two religious groups have gone to court many times over who should control the site.Since then, there have been calls to build a temple on the spot where the mosque once stood.Hinduism is India's majority religion and is thought to be more than 4,000 years old. India's first Islamic dynasty was established in the early 13th Century.The long and complicated property dispute has been dragging on in various courts for more than a century.This particular case is being fought between three main parties - two Hindu groups and the Muslim Waqf Board, which is responsible for the maintenance of Islamic properties in India.The Hindu litigants are the Hindu Mahasabha, a right-wing political party, and the Nirmohi Akhara, which is a sect of Hindu monks.They filed a title dispute in the Allahabad High Court in 2002, a decade after the mosque was demolished.A verdict in that case was pronounced in September 2010 - it determined that the 2.77 acres of the disputed land would be divided equally into three parts.The court ruled that the site should be split, with the Muslim community getting control of a third, Hindus another third and the Nirmohi Akhara sect the remainder. Control of the main disputed section, where the mosque once stood, was given to Hindus.The judgement also made three key observations.It affirmed the disputed spot was the birthplace of Lord Ram, that the Babri Masjid was built after the demolition of a Hindu temple, and that the mosque was not built in accordance with the tenets of Islam.The Supreme Court suspended this ruling in 2011 after both Hindu and Muslim groups appealed against it.",Ayodhya Ram Mandir,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-50347383,BBC,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""labeling"", ""reason"": ""Loaded labels/titles applied asymmetrically: 'right-wing' used to describe Hindu Mahasabha, implying a negative connotation."", ""confidence"": 0.8}",no,None,"States generic facts, with mild usage of labels"
11,Transforming a flashpoint holy city into the ‘Hindu Vatican’,"On a brutally cold morning, Yogendra Guru looked adrift in a maze of traffic after visiting the heavily secured makeshift shrine where Hindus believe Lord Ram was born.Frenzied construction work provided the backdrop in the northern Indian city of Ayodhya - a vast centre to welcome pilgrims, arched sandstone gates, a broad corridor leading to a grand new $217m (£170m) temple for the Hindu deity. A multi-billion dollar makeover has seen swathes of the city bulldozed to turn it into what some Hindu nationalist leaders are calling a ""Hindu Vatican"".Mr Guru had endured a gruelling 14-hour bus journey with two dozen family members who made the pilgrimage to Ayodhya from their village in Morena district in central Madhya Pradesh state.""I am elated that we are finally getting a new temple. It seems like the Hindus have awakened, experiencing a sense of freedom. I believe we were previously suppressed,"" he told me.Next week, Prime Minister Narendra Modi will fulfil a decades-long Hindu nationalist pledge by opening the temple, which replaces a 16th-Century mosque that once stood here, on one of India's most controversial religious sites. In 1992, Hindu mobs tore down the Babri mosque, claiming it was built by Muslim invaders on the ruins of a Ram temple, sparking nationwide riots that took nearly 2,000 lives.The stormy ownership dispute between Hindus and Muslims ended in 2019 when the Supreme Court granted the site to Hindus, despite explicitly stating that the demolition of the mosque was an ""egregious violation of the rule of law"". (The court gave Muslims another plot of land in Ayodhya to construct a mosque.)Mr Modi opens the Ayodhya temple months before general elections, with his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) eyeing a record third consecutive term. He says the new temple will ""unify the nation"". Senior minister Rajnath Singh believes the shrine would mark ""the beginning of India's cultural revival and restore national pride"".Critics say the timing of the opening leans more towards political strategy than religious significance, building a Hindu nationalist momentum ahead of the polls. After all, they argue, the movement to build a temple was a major factor in propelling the BJP to a prominent position in Indian politics.""After enduring life in a tent, Lord Ram has now found a rightful abode. It's been a test of patience for all of us,"" said Satyendra Das, the 86-year-old head priest of the makeshift shrine, where a smaller idol of Ram had been placed for the past three decades.The new temple is as grand as it gets. Stretching across 7.2 acres in a 70-acre complex, the imposing three-storey structure, clad in pink sandstone and anchored by black granite, boasts towering pillars and rests upon 70,000 sq ft (6,503 sq m) of pristine white marble. A 51-inch (4.25-ft) idol of Ram will be placed on a marble pedestal.When fully complete - Mr Modi will be opening only the ground floor on 22 January - by the end of the year, the temple will expect to greet a staggering 150,000 visitors per day, seven times the current rate.To make all this happen, Mr Modi's government is pulling out all the stops to transform Ayodhya, a tranquil pilgrim town on the banks of Saryu, a tributary of the Ganges, to what officials call a ""world class city where people come as pilgrims and tourists"".The $3.85bn (£3.01bn) makeover includes expanded roads, a shiny new airport, a massive railway station, and a multi-level car park. More than 3,000 homes, shops and ""structures of religious nature"" have been either completely or partially demolished to facilitate the widening of four main roads, including the newly christened 13km (8-mile) Ram Path, leading to the temple. A lighter yellow paint now gives the buildings a uniform, bland look.Hotel chains like Radisson and Taj are building new properties; up to 50 new hotels and homestays are planned, while scores of grubby guesthouses are receiving facelifts. Not surprisingly, land prices have already trebled.""You can't recognise the place, it's changed so much now. There's actually a bit of shock and awe that all this has happened,"" said Valay Singh, author of Ayodhya: City of Faith, City of Discord, who has been visiting the the city since 2016.There are also plans for additional attractions surrounding the new temple, including a heritage walk featuring 162 murals depicting Ram's life, a facility on a Saryu river island offering ""insights into the Vedic civilisation"", and the creation of a wedding city and developing the place as a naturopathy centre.""We want to create the most beautiful city in the world,"" says Gaurav Dayal, Ayodhya's most senior official.Faith threads its way through every facet of life in Ayodhya, where temples rise like sentinels in an untidy skyline and monks walk the streets. Tens of thousands of pilgrims circumambulate the city at least twice a year. The ubiquitous monkeys still have a free run. Bazaars teem with hawkers selling religious bric-a-brac: flowers, sandalwood, devotional books, replicas of deities.Mr Singh describes it as a ""fragile, pilgrim-dependent economy"". On her first visit to the city, Disha Chakraborty, a student of life sciences from Shillong in north-eastern India, told me: ""This place is dilapidated, let's be honest. But it doesn't matter because people are so devoted. So many have put their collective faith in an idol.""Yet, in this city of both a few thousand temples, large and small, and 45-odd mosques, and festivals and fairs, a transformation is under way, blending the old with the new.As well as tattoo parlours and takeout food, Ayodhya has a restaurant called Dark Cloud and a salon called Stylish Chand Men's Parlour, offering a variety of style cuts. Laser shows light up the sky after the dark. The place swarms with competing YouTubers and Instagram Reel makers, each trying to make the place ""trend"".Inspired by faith, tradition and curiosity, millions of devotees and tourists are now expected to descend on Ayodhya after the new temple opens. Yet, even in its peace, there are rumblings of discontent. The road-widening initiative for pilgrims slices through the city, leaving a trail of homes and shops smashed by bulldozers.Anand Kumar Gupta, who heads an association of local shopkeepers, said around 1,600 of them have ""been displaced and have nowhere to go"". He added that they were paid an average of 100,000 ($1,200) rupees for repairs. ""This rebuilding has disturbed us,"" he said.On a pilgrim route being widened, some three dozen homes of people who work in the city's temples stand partially demolished. The street is overflowing with sewage from leaky pipes. Wobbly bamboo bridges stretch precariously over muddy trenches that scar the ground outside the doors. Owners of the completely destroyed homes have been given plots at a distance.Vishal Pandey said that half of his ancestral six-room house had been demolished for the road widening. Despite a compensation close to 700,000 rupees for the affected portion, the toll on their eight-member generational dwelling is irreversible, he added. ""There is anger among the locals,"" Mr Pandey told me. ""But we are also happy that Ram is finally getting a permanent home. He was in a tent for such a long time. Now it's our turn [to suffer].""Where there is destruction, there is development. Let's see what happens.""Kanti Devi, who has lost half of her house, is more trenchant. ""We are not happy at all,"" she says. ""Even the officials come and tell us we are giving you a lot of pain. It's good that the temple has been made, but how does it help us? Whatever we built, they have razed to get more pilgrims into the town.""Officials say residents of the demolished dwellings and shops have been compensated with money and new houses under government schemes. ""All compensation has been given. It is delayed in some cases because of litigation involving family disputes. There's nothing left to be done now,"" says Mr Dayal.In many ways, people coming in from outside have shaped the destiny of Ayodhya where Hindus and Muslims have for long lived in mixed neighbourhoods. This endured despite the demolition and a subsequent attack on local Muslims in December 1992, allegedly leading to the death of 18 Muslims and the torching of their homes. It was a city that became the flashpoint for religious violence.""We have moved on. However, the events remain a source of pain for us,"" said Khaliq Ahmed Khan, a social worker.Mr Khan believes Hindus and Muslims shared warm relations in Ayodhya, rooted in a centuries-old inter-dependence. ""Hindu devotion to Ram is intertwined with the support of Muslims, particularly in the temple economy, where their trade plays a crucial role. The two communities are inseparable.""This sentiment is echoed by Raghuvansh Mani, a local college professor: ""The sectarian strife originated from outside; the local people have minimal involvement in that."" Some locals share similar sentiments, feeling that outsiders are determining their fate, as the new temple aims to open Ayodhya to the world.""Only time will tell,"" says Mr Pandey.",Ayodhya Ram Mandir,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-67775166,BBC,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""framing"", ""reason"": ""The article frames the transformation of Ayodhya as a 'makeover' and a 'world-class city', emphasizing its potential to attract tourists and pilgrims, while downplaying the displacement and suffering of local residents."", ""confidence"": 0.8}",no,none,"States factual statements also, without just framing the positive sides of the event"
12,India PM opens grand temple on razed mosque site,"Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has inaugurated a grand temple to Hindu god Ram in the flashpoint city of Ayodhya.He said it heralded ""a new era"" for India - the temple replaces a 16th-Century mosque torn down by Hindu mobs in 1992, sparking riots in which nearly 2,000 people died.Top film stars and cricketers were among guests at the event in Ayodhya.But some Hindu seers and most of the opposition boycotted it, saying Mr Modi was using it for political gain.General elections are due in India in the next few months and Mr Modi's political rivals say the governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) will be seeking votes in the temple's name in a country where 80% of the population is Hindu.Critics have also accused the government of exploiting a religious celebration in a country which - according to its constitution - is secular. For Muslims, India's biggest minority, the event evoked fear and painful memories, members of the community in Ayodhya told the BBC in the run-up to Monday's ceremony.Televised live, it showed Mr Modi performing religious rituals inside the temple's sanctum along with priests and Mohan Bhagwat, head of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) - the ideological fountainhead of Hindu nationalist parties.""Today's date will go down in history,"" Mr Modi said after the event. ""After years of struggle and countless sacrifices, Lord Ram has arrived [home]. I want to congratulate every citizen of the country on this historic occasion.""The temple has been constructed at a cost of $217m (£170m), funded from private donations. Only the ground floor was opened - the rest is expected to be completed by the end of the year. The construction work is part of a revamp for the city, estimated to cost more than $3bn.The building of the Ram temple in Ayodhya fulfils a decades-long Hindu nationalist pledge. Many Hindus believe the Babri mosque was built by Muslim invaders on the ruins of a temple where the Hindu god was born.The movement to build the temple helped propel the BJP into political prominence in the 1990s.There was a festive atmosphere as tens of thousands of chanting Hindu devotees waved flags and beat drums - military helicopters showered flower petals on the temple. Saffron flags with pictures of Lord Ram line streets in the city festooned with marigolds, as do banners with the faces of Mr Modi and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath.Some of India's biggest celebrities, including Bollywood star Amitabh Bachchan and cricketer Sachin Tendulkar, attended.In many other northern cities Hindus lit lamps, and saffron flags carrying images of Ram are fluttering on rooftops, including in several parts of Delhi. Cinemas screened the event, and big screens relayed pictures from Ayodhya to town squares and residential neighbourhoods.The ceremony, called Pran Pratishtha, which loosely translates from Sanskrit into ""establishment of life force"", lasted about an hour. Hindus believe that chanting mantras and performing rituals around a fire will infuse sacred life in an idol or a photograph of a deity.Several domestic TV stations built huge sets by the side of the river Saryu, a tributary of the Ganges, just behind the temple, and provided wall-to-wall coverage of the event, some proclaiming the moment of consecration as the start of ""Ram Rajya"" (Lord Ram's rule) in India.Hindus celebrated the inauguration in other countries too. Massive billboards of Lord Ram graced Times Square in New York, where a group of devotees braved the freezing weather to gather in the middle of the night.Temples all across the United Kingdom - where Indians are one of the largest diaspora groups - marked the event. Colourful posters had been shared inviting devotees to honour the occasion and celebrations involved flowers, sweets and music. There were also some celebrations in Muslim-majority Dubai - where Indians are a significant population - but from Indian news reports these appeared more muted than elsewhere.In 2019, the Supreme Court gave the disputed land to Hindus after a protracted legal battle followed the mosque's demolition. Muslims were given a plot outside the city for a mosque but have yet to build one.One member of the community the BBC spoke to in Ayodhya ahead of Monday's inauguration agreed that Hindus have the right to build the temple after the Supreme Court gave them the site.""We did not accept that decision happily, but what can we do,"" he said. Another man said he was happy Hindus are building the temple - ""but we are also sad because it was built after destroying a mosque"".The new three-storey temple - made with pink sandstone and anchored by black granite - stretches across 7.2 acres in a 70-acre complex. A 51-inch (4.25-ft) statue of the deity, specially commissioned for the temple, was unveiled last week. The idol has been placed on a marble pedestal in the sanctum sanctorum.Thousands of police were deployed for Monday's event, despite Mr Modi having appealed to pilgrims not to turn up and to watch the ceremony on television. In many states a full or half day holiday was called, with schools and colleges closed and stock markets shut.But a sour note was struck with some top religious seers saying that as the temple was not yet complete, it was against Hinduism to perform the rituals there, and many opposition leaders deciding to stay away.Some opposition-ruled states also announced their own plans for the day - West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee said she would pray at the iconic temple to goddess Kali in Kolkata and then lead an all-faith rally. The eastern state of Odisha (Orissa) unveiled huge plans to bring pilgrims to the Jagannath temple in Puri, one of the holiest sites for Hindus.Authorities say they expect more than 150,000 visitors per day once the temple in Ayodhya is fully ready.To accommodate this expected rush, new hotels are being built and existing ones spruced up as part of a major makeover and in recent weeks, a new airport and railway station have opened.Officials say they are building a ""world-class city where people come as pilgrims and tourists"", but many local people have told the BBC that their homes, shops and ""structures of religious nature"" have been either completely or partially demolished to expand roads and set up other facilities.",Ayodhya Ram Mandir,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-68003095,BBC,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""framing"", ""reason"": ""The article frames the event as a 'grand temple' and 'historic occasion', emphasizing its significance for Hindus, while also highlighting the controversy and opposition from Muslims and some Hindu seers."", ""confidence"": 0.8}",no,none,Covers both sides of the story while also showcasing the up-sides of the event
13,India’s opposition looked down and out – now they’re back,"The results of India’s general election announced on Tuesday are being interpreted in a rather unusual way. While the winners appear subdued, the runners-up are celebrating.The NDA alliance, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has won a historic third term in power, with more than 290 seats in the 543-member parliament.But his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on its own did not reach the magic figure of 272 seats needed to form the government – and the prime minister is now being seen as a much diminished leader.The outcome is being seen as a huge comeback for the opposition INDIA alliance and Congress party leader Rahul Gandhi, the face of the bloc.The alliance has won just over 230 seats and doesn’t have the numbers to cobble together a government – but more than 24 hours after counting of votes began, they were yet to concede.“It’s an extraordinary story,” political analyst Rashid Kidwai told the BBC. “The result is surprising. The opposition has managed to pull off the unexpected.”A jubilant Congress party called the verdict “a moral and political defeat for Mr Modi"", whose BJP had campaigned predominantly on his name and record. On Tuesday evening, Mr Gandhi told a press conference that “the country has unanimously sent a message to Mr Modi and [Home Minister] Amit Shah that we do not want you”.There’s a backdrop to this exuberance.Going into the election, the opposition seemed in complete disarray and the Congress-led INDIA bloc, made up of more than two dozen disparate regional parties, appeared to be on the verge of imploding. Experts questioned whether it was fit to challenge Mr Modi, who looked unstoppable at the time.And as the election neared, the opposition faced an uphill battle. Parties and leaders were raided by government agencies; two chief ministers – including Arvind Kejriwal of Delhi – were jailed; and bank accounts belonging to Congress were frozen by the income-tax authorities.The credit for the opposition’s performance, Mr Kidwai says, largely goes to Mr Gandhi, the much criticised scion of the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty. His great-grandfather Jawaharlal Nehru was the first and longest-serving prime minister of India. His grandmother and father also served as PM.“He’s a fifth generation dynast and came with a lot of historical baggage,” the political analyst explains. “The mainstream media in India was very hostile to him and social media didn’t take him seriously. He was targeted and projected as a non-serious politician who took too many holidays.”But, Mr Kidwai says, he overcame the odds and, in recent years, has worked hard to change that impression of himself and his party.“During his Bharat Jodo Yatra and the Nyay March through the length and breadth of the country, he met millions of people – which added to his stature and won him lots of support. It also gave him confidence and political heft.”But Mr Gandhi was still not perceived as a threat to Mr Modi. Last year, a court in Mr Modi’s home state Gujarat convicted the Congress leader of defamation. He was thrown out of parliament and barred from contesting elections – until the Supreme Court suspended his conviction.The perception that the BJP was seeking to go after the opposition, says political analyst and author Ajoy Bose, backfired.“The BJP got a bit arrogant and complacent. But their shock and awe tactics to intimidate the opposition worked against the BJP and led to the formation of the INDIA bloc.”The parties, he says, “were afraid they would be wiped off and many saw echoes of Emergency [a reference to the 1975 action of then-PM Indira Gandhi to suspend elections and curb civil rights] in the way the government was functioning”.India has “a history of competitive democracy”, Mr Bose says, adding that among the people “there was a sense of disquiet and discomfort about the country turning into a one-party dictatorship”.As the results show, the BJP juggernaut met strong resistance in several opposition-ruled states.In Tamil Nadu, the ruling DMK party kept the BJP out by winning all 39 seats in the state. In West Bengal, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee fought to limit the BJP to 12 seats (Mr Modi’s party had won 18 of the 42 seats in 2019). In Maharashtra, the BJP was limited to nine seats – it had won 23 of the 48 seats in 2019 and its then-ally Shiv Sena had bagged a further 18.But the biggest upset for Mr Modi and the BJP, Mr Bose says, came from the bellwether state of Uttar Pradesh (UP).“Akhilesh Yadav and his Samajwadi Party (SP) is the biggest success story of this election. A very clever alliance with Rahul Gandhi won them 43 of the state’s 80 seats. The BJP’s tally has been restricted to a poor 33.” Mr Modi's party won 62 seats in 2019 and took 71 in 2014.In the run-up to the election, Mr Modi had described Rahul Gandhi and Akhilesh Yadav as “a pair of boys” whose alliance had “flopped” many times in the past. But as the results show, this pair of boys soundly beat the BJP in UP.“A key takeaway from the election,” Mr Bose says, “is that the grand new Ram temple in Ayodhya city wasn’t enough for the BJP to win.”The party had banked on the Ram Mandir temple to be their trump card, with Mr Modi presiding over the opening of the unfinished temple in Ayodhya with much fanfare in January. But in the Faizabad constituency, where it is located, the BJP candidate lost.Abhishek Yadav, an SP youth-wing leader and a star campaigner for his party, told the BBC that initially they too believed that the temple would help the BJP win the key state.“Until early April, [the] election in the state had seemed like a one-sided contest with the odds stacked against us,” Mr Yadav told me recently. “But we sensed there was an undercurrent of resentment against the BJP when large numbers of people started gathering at our rallies.”People were unhappy about a lack of jobs and high food and fuel prices, he said. Many were also angry with the changes in how army soldiers are recruited.“With the Congress and SP fighting the election together as part of INDIA alliance, all anti-BJP voters came together to vote for us,” he added.Mr Kidwai says that – notwithstanding the surprisingly good performance of the opposition – in some ways, it was a missed opportunity, as the INDIA bloc failed to read the voters’ minds and did not sense the disquiet they felt with Mr Modi’s government.“They spoke about joblessness, rural economic distress and were able to win over many voters – but there were lots of gaps in their strategy,” he says. “The NDA’s third term has come only because of weaknesses in the INDIA bloc. They could have forged alliances in Andhra Pradesh and Odisha and that would have made their tally stronger.”But now that the NDA – and Mr Modi – are back in power, INDIA needs to institutionalise its alliance and Mr Gandhi, “the chief architect of the alliance”, must lead from the front, Mr Kidwai adds.“It’s unlikely that the government will stop going after the opposition. But it also can’t be business as usual for the government. They cannot continue with their politics of vendetta; it will have to be toned down.“The strength of opposition in parliament would allow restoration of functional ties in parliament. There’s great need for coalition politics now. And Congress as the single largest opposition party in the coalition must lead from the front.“The Gandhis consider themselves as trustees of power, not power-wielders. But now the time has come to change. Rahul Gandhi has to take on the mantle of leadership and lead.”",Ayodhya Ram Mandir,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp00jze920eo,BBC,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""tonality"", ""reason"": ""The article's tone is sympathetic to the opposition and critical of Prime Minister Modi and the BJP, using words like 'jubilant', 'exuberance', and 'moral and political defeat' to describe their performance."", ""confidence"": 0.8}",yes,tonality,"Despite the peaceful efforts of the event, the tone on the article criticalizes only one side."
14,"Can alcohol, cooking oil tempt unvaccinated Indians?","After a slow start, India's Covid-19 vaccination drive has hit some promising milestones over the past few months.Though the programme will miss its first, over-ambitious deadline of universal adult vaccination by 31 December, more than 85% of eligible Indians have been partially vaccinated till now. Over 55% have received both jabs.But that still leaves millions - including many who are more vulnerable due to their age - at risk, especially with the new Omicron variant fuelling fears.To draw people to vaccination centres, some Indian states have been offering unusual incentives.In the western state of Gujarat, a municipal corporation offered a litre of cooking oil to vaccine takers and found that it worked well, especially among the less well-off.In the capital, Delhi, having vaccinated parents could boost a child's chance to get into a good pre-school, a notoriously difficult task.Nudges like these aren't new in India, where millions are dependent on state welfare programmes, administered by a vast bureaucracy.But even then, one announcement stood out.On 23 November, a local official in the central state of Madhya Pradesh announced a 10% discount on alcohol for people who had received both vaccine doses.A day later, the order was withdrawn after a lawmaker from the governing Bharatiya Janata Party pointed out it could encourage alcohol consumption.The district official's attempt, says epidemiologist Chandrakant Lahariya, was a ""perverse incentive"" - one that would probably achieve its short-term objective, but at an unintended cost.But it also underlines the challenge before India's government as it attempts to achieve universal adult vaccination.The supply bottlenecks that slowed down the drive in the initial months seem to have been fixed, agree experts.But they say it's hard to pinpoint just one reason for millions still remaining unvaccinated.""Having a vaccine supply pipeline does not automatically translate to universal access. Many people may have to travel long distances or give up wages for half a day to get the jab,"" says Dr Lahariya.It's essential, he adds, for the government to do a granular analysis.""There isn't enough data available in the public domain to analyse what's stopping people. The government should identify pockets of low coverage and map it against the national census,"" he says.Another reason could be a sense of complacency after getting one vaccine dose or having contracted Covid-19.In November, Health Minister Mansukh Mandaviya had said that more than 120 million people who got the first shot were yet to turn up for the second.Infection counts have also been low - India has reported cases around or below 10,000 every day for more than a month now.And vaccine hesitancy could be playing a role too - some Indians have said they think the vaccine is more dangerous than the virus.For health economist Dr Rijo M John, a major worry is the number of vulnerable adults who may be at risk if cases begin rising again.Almost 40% of people above 45 years - around 140 million - are yet to get either one or both doses of the vaccine.""The onus is on the government to find out why and, if needed, take the vaccine to their doorstep,"" he says.But can incentives help? It's hard to say.Many countries have tried to nudge people into turning up for vaccines.In Russia, some companies tried convincing vaccine-doubters by raffling snowmobiles and cars.Thousands of people in Hong Kong rushed to get vaccinated after a slew of incentives, including chances to win expensive apartments, gold bars and Tesla cars, were announced.In the United States, some local governments offered gift cards or ran lotteries to encourage vaccination.But a National Bureau of Economic Research working paper, based on a study conducted in a California county, said that incentives didn't increase vaccination rates.""Reaching a goal of very high vaccination rates likely requires much stronger policy levers, such as employer rules or government mandates,"" wrote the authors.Other researchers found no evidence that a lottery system set up by Ohio state to pay randomly selected vaccine recipients up to $1 million had worked.A study that surveyed respondents in Germany had a nuanced conclusion: that vaccinations could be increased if the government either granted liberties not available to the unvaccinated or provided ""sizeable"" financial rewards or ensured local doctors could give jabs.However, it also added that these incentives had ""limited"" scope for altering people's behaviour, and said that they may work better in the initial stages of vaccine rollout.Dr John says that for less vulnerable age groups, disincentives - such as delaying some benefits or making unvaccinated people wait longer in queues - may be a better option than incentives.""Once you start offering monetary incentives, it opens up opportunities for malpractice. It would be better to create a situation where people feel taking the vaccine is in their own interests,"" he says.Countries such as Germany and Austria have begun cracking down on unvaccinated people, tightening restrictions on them and banning them from bars and restaurants.Last month, New York City put thousands of unvaccinated municipal workers on unpaid leave as a new mandate came into effect. It's also planning to make vaccination compulsory for on-site employees at all private businesses.While the carrot-and-stick approach may work in some places in the short term, Dr Lahariya says it would be better for India to look for lessons from its past successes, especially the polio vaccination programme.India was declared polio-free in 2014 after years of grassroots work, which included removing structural barriers to vaccination and increasing vaccine confidence.""It's essential to have better engagement at the community level to make sure the Covid-19 vaccination programme is successful in the long term,"" says Dr Lahariya.",Covaxin,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-59694246,BBC,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""tonality"", ""reason"": ""The article presents a neutral and informative tone, but occasionally uses words with a slightly negative connotation to describe the government's efforts, such as 'perverse incentive' and 'challenge'.

15,India approves two Covid jabs for children under 12,"India has approved two homegrown vaccines for children under the age of 12 amid a slight rise in Covid cases.Covaxin, made by Bharat Biotech, has been granted emergency use permission for the six-12 age group, health minister Mansukh Mandaviya tweeted.It is already administered to children aged 12-18, and adults.Two other vaccines have also been given emergency approval - Corbevax for children aged five-12; and Zydus's two-dose jab for children above 12.Corbevax is also currently being administered to children in the 12-14 age group.The emergency-use nod doesn't mean India will immediately start vaccinating children younger than 12 - that can only begin once the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation gives a green signal.India has so far administered over 1.87 billion doses since it began Covid vaccinations in January 2021.The country has recorded a small rise in new Covid cases over the past week, with the capital Delhi accounting for almost half of the 2,500 new infections on Tuesday.About 80% of eligible adults have been fully vaccinated and more than 99% have received at least one jab so far.Since 10 January, India has also been administering booster shots to healthcare and frontline workers, and those above 60 with comorbidities.It also started vaccinating 15-18-year-olds the same month, and later expanded the drive to include children over the age of 12.India has approved nine Covid vaccines, five of which have been locally made. Only two have been widely used.India is currently using four vaccines - Covishield, Covaxin, Sputnik V and Corbevax - for its drive. Of these, Covishield accounts for over 81% of the doses given so far.In February the government had granted emergency use permission to Sputnik Light, a component of the Russian-made Sputnik V vaccine, which India had approved last year.The Sputnik V vaccine, developed by Moscow's Gamaleya Institute, had generated some controversy initially after being rolled out before the final trial data had been released. But scientists say its benefits have now been demonstrated.It uses a cold-type virus, engineered to be harmless, as a carrier to deliver a small fragment of the coronavirus to the body. After being vaccinated, the body starts to produce antibodies especially tailored to the virus.Sputnik Light comprises the component used in the first dose of the Sputnik V vaccine.In December, the country approved the Serum Institute of India's Covovax and Biological E's Corbevax for emergency use.It also approved ZyCoV-D vaccine - the world's first DNA vaccine against Covid - by Zydus, but it's not available yet.The government had also approved Johnson & Johnson's single-dose vaccine, which was to be introduced in India through a supply agreement with Biological E; and it had authorised Indian pharma company Cipla to import the Moderna vaccine.But it's unclear when either of those will be available in India.The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, locally known as Covishield, is made from a weakened version of a common cold virus (known as an adenovirus) from chimpanzees. It has been modified to look more like coronavirus - although it can't cause illness.Covaxin by Indian firm Bharat Biotech  is an inactivated vaccine which means that it is made up of killed coronaviruses, making it safe to be injected into the body.The vaccine ran into controversy after India's regulators gave it emergency approval in January while the third phase of the trial was still under way, sparking scepticism and questions from experts. Bharat Biotech, which makes the vaccine, has since published data suggesting 78% efficacy.Corbevax from Indian pharma company Biological E was developed in collaboration with US-based Dynavax and Baylor College of Medicine.It is India's first indigenously developed recombinant protein sub-unit vaccine. That is, it's made up of the coronavirus' ""spike protein"", which the virus uses to latch on and enter human cells. When injected, this is expected to trigger an immune response in the body.Covovax is a local version of the Novavax vaccine, and will be produced by the Serum Institute of India, which is also manufacturing Covishield.The vaccine was more than 90% effective in a late-stage US-based clinical trial, according to the company.The ZyCoV-D vaccine uses plasmids - or small rings of DNA that contain genetic information - to deliver the jab between two layers of the skin.The three-dose ZyCoV-D vaccine prevented symptomatic disease in 66% of those vaccinated, according to an interim study quoted by the vaccine maker Cadila Healthcare.It is also India's first needle-free Covid-19 jab - administered with a disposable needle-free injector, which uses a narrow stream of the fluid to penetrate the skin and deliver the jab to the proper tissue.Previous DNA vaccines have worked well in animals but not humans.The challenge, say scientists, was how to push the plasmid DNA into the human cell so that it gives a durable immune response.Dr Jeremy Kamil, a virologist at Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center in Shreveport, told the BBC that it was imperative that the efficacy data of the vaccine ""be vetted independently"".The other candidates which are in different stages of trials in India to test safety and efficacy include:",Covaxin,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-55748124,BBC,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""omission"", ""reason"": ""The article does not mention any potential risks or controversies associated with Covaxin, such as the fact that it was approved for emergency use while its third phase of trial was still underway.

16,India reports highest daily coronavirus deaths,"India has recorded its highest daily coronavirus death toll since the pandemic began - a day after it became the first country to register more than 400,000 new cases in a 24-hour period.Its health ministry said 3,689 people had died within the past 24 hours.Prime Minister Narendra Modi met the health minister on Sunday morning to review the crisis.Hospitals are battling to treat patients amid a chronic shortage of beds and medical oxygen.Amid the surge, results came in from elections in several Indian states. They have been closely watched to see if voters would punish Mr Modi's handling of the crisis.His BJP party suffered a setback in West Bengal, a state the party had hoped to capture. The state was instead comfortably held by the incumbent.India has recorded more than 19 million cases of coronavirus - second only to the US. It has also confirmed more than 215,000 deaths, though the real toll is thought to be far higher.Experts have cited low testing rates and the number of people dying at home, especially in rural areas, as contributing factors to under-reported figures.The country's previous highest daily death toll, also reported this week, was 3,645.Brazil and the US have both registered daily tolls of more than 4,000 during the course of the pandemic.In India, distressing images of families begging for hospital beds and life-saving supplies have been emerging for more than 10 days, while morgues and crematoriums remain overwhelmed.Twelve people died on Saturday at Delhi's Batra Hospital after it ran out of oxygen - for the second time in a week.The Times of India newspaper reported 16 deaths in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh due to oxygen shortages in two hospitals, and six in the Delhi suburb of Gurgaon.Delhi High Court has now declared it will start punishing officials if life-saving supplies don't make it to hospitals.""Water has gone above the head. Enough is enough,"" said Justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Patil.All adults in India are now eligible for a coronavirus vaccine. But the planned launch of a nationwide drive on Saturday faltered as several states said they did not have enough doses to start vaccinating those aged 18-44.Despite being the world's biggest producer of vaccines, the country is suffering an internal shortage and has placed a temporary hold on all exports of AstraZeneca to meet domestic demand.The Health Ministry said on Sunday that 84,599 people in the age bracket had been given a first dose of the coronavirus vaccine.India has been using two vaccines - the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab (known locally as Covishield) and another made by Indian firm Bharat Biotech (Covaxin). The Russian-made Sputnik V vaccine has also been approved for use, and the first 150,000 doses arrived on Saturday.Countries worldwide have sent a flood of emergency medical supplies. As of Thursday, 40 nations had sent shipments.The first of several planes from the US carrying oxygen cylinders, masks and rapid diagnostic tests arrived in Delhi on Friday.""The bond between the oldest democracy & the largest one keeps getting fortified,"" India's health ministry tweeted.The US had previously been criticised for imposing a ban on sending raw materials for vaccines abroad, which limited India's ability to make more of the AstraZeneca jab. The measure was lifted last week.A German military aircraft with 120 ventilators reached India on Saturday, while the UK has also sent hundreds of pieces of medical equipment.UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show on Sunday that he would ""always look very carefully at any request"" to help as India deals with its record surge of Covid cases.But asked if the UK should pause the vaccination of younger, less vulnerable people to send doses abroad, Mr Raab said he had not received any request from India ""on that specific issue"".The central government is reluctant to impose a national lockdown, which the prime minister has called a ""last resort"". Senior leaders fear the economic impact, after last year's lockdown saw India's output fall by a record 24% in April-June compared to a year earlier.The human cost could also be severe. Last year's 68-day national lockdown saw millions of India's migrant workers make arduous journeys back to their home villages after they found themselves unemployed and running out of money.The poor, especially undernourished children and pregnant women who rely on government programmes, found it difficult to access benefits. Immunisation programs were halted, and those suffering from serious illnesses struggled to access crucial health services.But several states and union territories do have restrictions in place.Odisha was the latest to announce a two-week lockdown, joining hard-hit Delhi, Maharashtra, Karnataka and West Bengal.Other states, including populous Uttar Pradesh, have either night curfews or weekend lockdowns.The Indian Express newspaper reports that India's Covid-19 taskforce, which advises the government, is pushing hard for a nationwide lockdown to help subdue the devastating second wave.Dr Anthony Fauci, the top US infectious disease expert, said on Saturday that an ""immediate"" shutdown for a ""few weeks"" could break the chain of transmission in India.",Covaxin,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-56961940,BBC,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""tonality"", ""reason"": ""The article's tone is critical of the Indian government's handling of the pandemic, using words like 'crisis', 'chronic shortage', and 'devastating second wave'.

17,EU nations hit by delayed Pfizer vaccine deliveries,"Several EU countries are receiving significantly fewer doses of the Pfizer coronavirus vaccine than expected, after the US firm slowed shipments.Six nations called the situation ""unacceptable"" and warned it ""decreases the credibility of the vaccination process"".Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia urged the EU to apply pressure on Pfizer-BioNTech.Pfizer said the reduced deliveries were a temporary issue.In a statement on Friday, the drugmaker said shipments were being affected by changes to its manufacturing processes designed to boost production.""Although this will temporarily impact shipments in late January to early February, it will provide a significant increase in doses available for patients in late February and March,"" Pfizer said.The company said its production upgrades would also have a ""short-term impact"" on the delivery of vaccines to the UK.Despite this, the UK government said it still planned to hit its target of vaccinating all priority groups by mid-February - about 15 million people.The vaccine from Pfizer is not the only candidate available in the UK, with the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca jab also currently being rolled out.The EU is not wholly reliant on the Pfizer jab either, having approved a vaccine manufactured by US company Moderna for use. Still, the development is expected to slow the pace of vaccination programmes.The German health ministry called Pfizer's announcement surprising and regrettable, noting that it had committed to binding delivery dates until mid-February.EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said she had been assured by Pfizer's chief executive that all orders guaranteed for delivery in the first quarter of the year would arrive.Last week, Ms von der Leyen said Pfizer had agreed to supply the EU with 600 million doses this year, double its initial order.The pledge may do little to soothe European governments battling to subdue a fast-spreading Covid-19 variant first detected in the UK.About a third of the 27 EU governments reported having ""insufficient"" vaccine doses at a meeting this week, Reuters reported, citing a participant.Lithuania said it would now get only half as many Pfizer vaccine doses as promised until mid-February.Belgium said it expected to receive about half the planned doses in January. Canada is also affected, because its vaccine supplies come from a Pfizer factory in Belgium.Norway, which is not an EU member, said on Friday that Pfizer was temporarily reducing the number of vaccine doses delivered to the country as of next week.The Norwegian Institute of Public Health said in a statement that it could supplement the loss using ""emergency stock"". ""The stock we now have will be able to compensate for a reduction in the planned deliveries for a few weeks ahead,"" it said.As well as Pfizer-BioNTech, the European Commission has reached agreements with five other pharmaceutical companies to purchase hundreds of millions of vaccines, once they pass clinical trials:The Commission concluded initial talks with another company, Novavax, for up to 200 million doses.Elsewhere in the world, Turkey said it had vaccinated half a million people in two days with vaccines developed by China's Sinovac Biotech.The figures suggest Turkey vaccinated more people on the first day of its roll-out than France did in almost three weeks.The French government faced a storm of criticism after it emerged that only 500 people had been vaccinated in the first week of the roll-out, which began in late December.Vaccination efforts have since stepped up, though, with 388,730 people receiving at least one dose so far, according to CovidTracker.In the US, President-elect Joe Biden on Friday unveiled an ambitious plan to ramp up vaccinations against Covid-19 when he takes office on 20 January.Mr Biden said his administration would set up new mass vaccination centres and hire extra health workers to achieve his target of inoculating 100 million Americans within his first 100 days in office.The incoming president made the announcement as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a stark warning about the spread of a highly transmissible coronavirus variant in the US.India, meanwhile, launched the world's largest vaccination campaign on Saturday.Efforts are under way to inoculate 1.3 billion people against the disease, starting with healthcare and frontline workers.

18,The claims being made about India's 'free vaccines',"India has announced a record eight million jabs on the first day of a new vaccination push, the highest number it's done so far.Under a newly-introduced policy, the federal government now buys Covid-19 jabs directly from manufacturers and supplies them to the state authorities.India is one of the largest vaccine makers in the world.But its own vaccination drive has been moving at a slow pace with just over 5% of the population fully vaccinated.On the first day of the new policy, Prime Minister Narendra Modi praised the pace of India's vaccine programme.Mr Modi had announced earlier this month that everyone would get ""free vaccines"" from 21 June.Health Minister, Dr Harsh Vardhan, tweeted that the eight million jabs was the highest number of doses administered in a single day globally.But that's not correct as China holds the record for administering the highest number of doses in a single day, going by figures compiled by Our World in Data.It gave out 20.8 million doses on 21 June, and has also been ramping up its vaccination programme.However, it was a single day record for India, leading some Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) politicians to praise the move by the federal government to take over the vaccination drive.The total number of vaccines administered rose by over 90% on 21 June, compared with the previous day.But it is worth noting that vaccine doses administered in some states had dropped noticeably in the days leading up to 21 June.In Madhya Pradesh, the numbers dropped significantly by 82% from 13-16 June and 17-20 June.In Haryana, vaccine administration dropped by 22% between 15-17 June and 18-20 June before it achieved the highest single-day record.Numbers dropped on the previous day in other states as well - something that is usually seen on Sundays.And It was significantly lower than usual in Gujarat and Assam states.India has administered over 276 million vaccine doses since January, that's less than 30% of the eligible adult population.India's adult population is estimated as being around 950 million.India's vaccine drive picked up pace in early April, with 3.66 million doses administered on 10 April, the highest figure achieved by that date.But it fell by nearly half in mid-May and several states suspended vaccinations for the 18-44 age group due to shortages.Experts say that India had failed to order enough vaccines last year to avoid shortages.The federal government now buys 75% of all vaccines manufactured.And state governments get their vaccines doses for free from the federal government, rather than buying from the manufacturers.However, it's worth noting that the remaining 25% of vaccines are still set aside for procurement by private hospitals as before.These vaccinations are not free - and have to be paid for at private hospitals.Prices have been fixed at 780 rupees ($10.7; £7.5) for Covishield, 1,145 rupees ($15.7; £11) for Sputnik V, and 1,410 rupees ($19.3; £13.6) for Covaxin.Under the previous Covid vaccine policy, only half of all vaccines produced in India went to the federal government  -  25% went to state administrations and 25% to private hospitals.The states competed in the open market to buy vaccines doses for the general population in the 18-44 age group, which were then given out free at state vaccination centres.Meanwhile, the federal government was responsible for vaccinating all frontline workers and those aged above 45 years - also for free.The federal government will now allocate vaccines to the states based on their population sizes, the level of disease, vaccination progress and vaccine wastage.The announcement happened just days after the previous policy attracted criticism from India's top court. It questioned the rationale behind it as it sometimes led to states paying more for vaccines than the federal government had to.""This is a step in the right direction and will streamline some procurement-related challenges,"" says health policy expert Dr Chandrakant Lahariya.But he adds that it doesn't change much for ordinary citizens as vaccines were already free of charge.The new policy is in fact similar to what India did when it began its vaccine rollout in January this year.This was even acknowledged by Mr Modi himself, who said ""the old system, in place before 1 May, will be implemented again.""The idea is that with states no longer needing to buy vaccines directly, they will not end up competing against each for a limited supply (which disadvantaged those states with fewer financial resources.)Read more from Reality CheckSend us your questions",Covaxin,https://www.bbc.com/news/57400891,BBC,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""omission"", ""reason"": ""The article fails to mention the potential benefits of the new policy, such as increased vaccine availability and streamlined procurement.

19,"Pregnant, unprotected and living in fear of Covid","When Jagriti Eadala found out she was pregnant in February, she and her husband celebrated by going on a holiday. It coincided with their anniversary and Covid appeared to be on the wane in India.But within a month, the 29-year-old found herself cloistered in a room, scared to step out. The virus had returned with alarming ferocity. Her husband had to continue going to work, so she isolated herself from everyone in the house.By then, India had begun vaccination against Covid but that was not an option for Jagriti. It still isn't because the jab has not been approved for pregnant women in the country. The government recently cleared it for nursing mothers, but there is no word on what pregnant women should expect, leaving them anxious and scared.""I had Covid in November and I have good antibody levels, but my doctor said I need to be very careful. I am pretty paranoid,"" Jagriti says, adding that she knows of someone who was nine months pregnant when she tested positive for Covid. The baby was born by C-section but the mother had to go on a ventilator. She survived but, Jagriti says, stories like this frighten her.There are many such stories, too often with a heartbreaking end. A 35-year-old man in Delhi lost his wife to Covid, two weeks after she delivered a baby girl. He says he is still in shock, unable to fathom how he is going to parent his three children - he has two young daughters - without the ""wonder woman"" by his side. ""Don't take corona lightly,"" a young Covid positive doctor said, struggling to speak in a video that was shared after she died of the infection. She was seven months pregnant but the baby had died in her womb the day before.Studies have shown that  Covid positive pregnant women, compared to non-pregnant women, are at higher risk of dying from the virus. They are also more likely to be admitted to the ICU, hooked to an invasive ventilator, develop dangerous pregnancy complications or deliver prematurely.Hundreds of pregnant women have reportedly died of the virus in India but there is no official data. The situation is likely far worse in rural areas, where poor surveillance, delayed testing and spotty access to critical care has led to a high death toll from the virus.Could the vaccine have saved them?""In my opinion, the vaccines were developed quickly for the right reasons - but it usually takes 10 years before most vaccines are declared safe for pregnant women. The government is trying to play safe. But there is no decision yet and millions of pregnant women are very vulnerable. We hope to get a positive response from the government soon,"" says Dr Meenakshi Ahuja, director of obstetrics and gynaecology in Delhi's Fortis La Femme hospital.India's federation of gynaecologists too has recommended that pregnant women be allowed to consult with their doctors and decide.Immunity is generally compromised during pregnancy but Dr Ahuja says Covid positive pregnant women are especially vulnerable in the third trimester. The growing uterus pushes against the diaphragm, compressing the lungs and making it harder to breathe in a normal amount of air.""So the first thing we try to do is to deliver the baby even if it's premature,"" Dr Ahuja says. ""That is one reason why we have seen a rise in neonatal deaths.""The other concern is the delivery itself.""A vaginal delivery requires the woman to lie down on her back. Lying down straight pushes the diaphragm and the lungs further up, lung capacity reduces and her oxygen levels are likely to drop,"" says Ruma Satwik, an obstetrician at Delhi's Sir Ganga Ram hospital.She adds that pregnant women with mild or no symptoms need not panic - but among the ""smaller subset"" who are admitted with a moderate to serious infection, the ""mortality rates appear to be higher than what it would be in pre-Covid figures"".""We hadn't seen a single mortality the first time around [the first wave]. This time it's been much worse.""Dr Satwik says she is still unsure of recommending the vaccine to her patients in the absence of any clear data or studies - she points to the fact that Covishield and Covaxin, the two jabs that India is currently administering, have not been tested on pregnant women.Last month, Brazil suspended Covishield for pregnant women after a woman who had taken the shot died. Some countries have also stopped giving it amid increasing reports that it was linked to blood clots.This is also a fear among gynaecologists because pregnant women are at higher risk of developing blood clots, Dr Ahuja says.The countries that are vaccinating pregnant women - US, UK, EU, Australia - are giving the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines, both of which have been deemed safe by a major new retrospective study.But in the absence of vaccines, critics say, India's federal government appears to have no strategy for treating pregnant women - only a handful of hospitals in big cities are even admitting them if they are Covid positive. The government failed to prioritise pregnant women - who number in the millions each year - as a high-risk category early on. Doctors now fear that they will still be at a disadvantage as delays and prohibitive costs prevent most Indians from getting a jab.Those who can afford it are looking for alternatives - the BBC spoke to one family in Delhi who say they went to the US to get the woman vaccinated because they couldn't wait endlessly.""To be very frank, there is no protection for pregnant women or lactating mothers,"" says 29-year-old Avni Reddy.She and her four-month-old baby were diagnosed with Covid in April. They recovered after mild symptoms, but Ms Reddy says she was just given a pain killer because she couldn't take anything stronger while breastfeeding.""I was lucky because the infection was mild, But what if I had a severe infection?""",Covaxin,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-57169834,BBC,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""tonality"", ""reason"": ""The article's tone is sympathetic and emotive, using words like 'scared', 'anxious', 'heartbreaking' to describe the experiences of pregnant women with Covid.

20,India to export Covid vaccines 'within weeks',"India will begin exporting locally-made coronavirus vaccines within a fortnight of their launch, a foreign ministry official has told the BBC.The official dismissed reports that India would ban exports of vaccines it is producing to meet local demand.India makes about 60% of vaccines globally and many countries are eagerly waiting for it to begin shipping doses.It has formally approved the emergency use of two vaccines as it prepares to begin giving jabs in January.India is planning one of the world's biggest inoculation programmes, seeking to immunise about 300 million people by July.The country's drugs regulator has given the green light to two vaccines - one developed by AstraZeneca with Oxford University (Covishield) and one by local firm Bharat Biotech (Covaxin).The foreign ministry official confirmed that India's plan to help other countries was on track.""Within a fortnight of the rollout of the vaccines we will allow exports to some of our South Asian neighbours. Some of these exports will be paid by us as gifts, and the others will be supplied at roughly the same price the government will be buying the vaccines at,"" the foreign ministry official, who preferred to remain unnamed, told me.""India is completely conscious of its commitments to neighbours and the rest of the world as the world's biggest vaccine maker.""Federal Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan said  India plans to roll out Covid-19 vaccines by the middle of this month.""Within 10 days from the date of Emergency Use Authorisation [3 January], there will be vaccine roll-out,"" he told reporters in Delhi.The CEO of the Serum Institute of India, which is manufacturing the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine in India, also sought to clarify the confusion over exports.Adar Poonawalla had been quoted in the media as saying that India would not allow exports of his vaccine for ""several months"". He told the Associated Press that  his company has been barred from exporting the vaccine and selling the vaccine in the private market.But on Tuesday he told the BBC's Yogita Limaye his firm was allowed to export the vaccine for government immunisation programmes abroad, and expects to deliver on agreements with Bangladesh, Saudi Arabia and Morocco in the next few weeks.On Monday, he said his firm could only give the vaccines to the government, and that the first 100 million doses would be sold at a special price of 200 rupees ($2.74), ""after which the price will be higher"".This raised concerns in India's neighbouring countries, including Nepal and Bangladesh, which are primarily depending on the SII to start vaccinating their populations.Bangladesh had already ordered 30 million doses of the vaccine in the first phase, Reuters reported. The country's health secretary told local media in December that it expected the first batch of the jab by February.Serum Institute and Bharat Biotech have a combined stockpile of more than 70 million doses of Covid vaccines, and will scale up production enormously to meet the rising demand.On Tuesday, the two vaccine makers released a joint statement saying both the companies would provide ""global access for our Covid-19 vaccines"".",Covaxin,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-55538092,BBC,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""source"", ""reason"": ""The article relies heavily on statements from Indian government officials and vaccine manufacturers, while not providing a counter-perspective from other countries or experts."", ""confidence"": 0.8}",no,None,No bias
21,India seeks EU travel approval for its main jab,"India's Serum Institute is seeking emergency authorisation in the European Union for its Covishield jab, sources told the BBC.The move comes amid reports that Covishield is not yet eligible for the digital green certificate, an EU-wide travel pass, set to launch on 1 July.The certificate is currently for EU citizens only.Covishield is the Indian-made version of AstraZeneca's Vaxzevria jab, which has been authorised in the EU.It's manufactured in India by Serum, the world's largest vaccine maker.The vaccines currently eligible for the green pass have all been approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA).Serum's CEO, Adar Poonawalla, said on Monday that his company hopes to ""resolve this matter soon"", referring to the fact that Covishield had not yet been authorised in the EU.The EMA told the BBC on Monday that the Serum Institute had not yet applied for authorisation.The European Commission has left it to individual member states to decide whether to allow travellers who have received vaccines ""that have been authorised at the national level or by the World Health Organization (WHO)"".Covishield was listed for emergency use by the WHO in February.It's unclear yet if the same rules will also apply to international travellers visiting the EU.India has so far overwhelmingly administered Covishield jabs - they account for more than 284 million of the 323 or so million vaccinations given so far.Covaxin, an Indian homegrown vaccine, which has not yet received WHO approval, has also not applied for EMA authorisation. Sputnik V, which is the third vaccine approved for use in India, is on the EMA's list of vaccines currently under review. But it has not been rolled out yet in India due to supply delays.At a recent meeting of G7 countries to which India was invited, India's health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan  said that India was ""strongly opposed to a  'vaccine passport' at this juncture"".The UK's Equality and Human Rights Commission recently said that introducing  Covid status certificates would be discriminating against some groups saying they could create a ""two-tier society whereby only certain groups are able to fully enjoy their rights"".",Covaxin,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-57633980,BBC,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""selection"", ""reason"": ""The article focuses on India's Covishield jab seeking EU approval while mentioning Covaxin in a separate sentence, implying that the latter is not relevant to the current issue.

22,Indians' desperate wait for Covid jab to get longer,"India started its vaccine drive in January, amid plummeting cases and a fair bit of optimism.The country's very own Serum Institute of India (SII), the world's largest vaccine maker, was meant to supply most of the jabs as the country headed towards an ambitious target - covering 250 million people by July.As part of a World Health Organization (WHO)-led scheme, India even exported vaccines to countries that needed them.But three months on, Covid cases and deaths are spiking across the country. Only about 26 million people have been fully vaccinated out of a population of 1.4 billion, and about 124 million have received a single dose. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government has cancelled exports, reneging on international commitments. Worse, vaccine stocks in the country have nearly dried up, and no-one is sure when more will arrive.How did India get here?On Wednesday afternoon local time - just as millions of Indians were trying to register online for a Covid jab - the vaccine portal and its accompanying apps crashed.Starting 1 May, India is opening up vaccination for roughly 600 million more people, to cover 18-44 year olds. But CoWin, as the platform is known, couldn't handle it.""I am stuck in an OTP loop of horrors,"" said one 33-year-old while trying to register for her jab. OTPs, or one-time passwords sent to mobile numbers, are a favoured Indian way of verifying identity online. She had a string of messages with OTPs, but nowhere to put them.Others didn't even get that far - #WaitingForOTP was soon trending on Twitter, and the memes and jokes followed. Eventually the site was back up - but, to the disappointment of more than 13 million people who did finally register, not a single vaccine centre had slots for booking.These are just a fraction of the 600 million people newly eligible for a jab. There's also another 200 million or so, 45 and above, who are yet to get their second jab.Experts say the government should have finished vaccinating people above 45 before opening it up further, especially when supply was low. In fact, this appeared to be the plan until as recently as 6 April, when the health ministry said the drive could not simply be ""accelerated"" and that it was not yet considering expanding it to all adults.It's likely the rapid, unrelenting surge in cases and reports that younger people were increasingly being admitted to hospital with severe symptoms led to the decision.""They should have held their nerve and focused on the vulnerable,"" says economist Partha Mukhopadhyay. ""Now they [the 45 and above] have to compete with 600 million new demanders.""Since the announcement, those who have received no doses or a single dose so far have been queuing up at centres before supply runs out, raising the risk of infection.But that's not the only factor that has thrown India's vaccine drive into chaos.Until now, India's federal government had been the sole purchaser of the two approved vaccines - Covishield, developed by AstraZeneca with Oxford University and manufactured by SII; and Covaxin, made by a local firm Bharat Biotech.But it's now thrown open the market to not just 28 state governments, but also private hospitals, all of whom can directly negotiate and buy from the two vaccine makers. And they have to pay far more.The federal government still gets 50% of stocks for 150 rupees ($2; £1.40) per dose, but states have to pay double that, and private hospitals eight times as much - all while competing for the remaining half.The sudden transfer of responsibility - it was announced just 10 days ago - left officials with little time to negotiate prices or stockpile vaccines. Especially since vaccine makers still have orders pending from the federal government.""We are the only country in the world that is allowing sub-national governments to directly buy from vaccine makers. This is not at all well thought-out,"" says Mr Mukhopadhyay.The different prices are concerning, says Srinath Reddy, a public health expert who advises federal and state governments on tackling Covid-19.""All vaccination should be free, it's for public good,"" he says. ""And why should states pay a higher price? They are also using tax payer money.""He fears that it's now a ""seller's market"", where the poorest Indians are likely to be last in line.Two private hospital chains have already announced that they will roll out the vaccine for 18-44 year olds from tomorrow, but it's unclear how they managed to secure supply when states are struggling.  Some have even said they are putting the expansion on hold until more vaccines arrive.No-one really seems to know. Even if some stocks do trickle in, the crunch will likely continue because the maths simply does not add up.The federal government still needs another 615 million doses to finish vaccinating everyone above the age of 45 - about 440 million people. State governments are expected to pick up the tab for 18-44 year olds - there are 622 million of them and they would need more than 1.2 billion doses. Even vaccinating 70% - to achieve herd immunity - would require some 870 million doses. This does not account for wastage, which means more stocks are needed.To be able to administer all of these doses in the next year, India needs to be giving 3.5 million doses a day - it's behind by more than a million doses right now.And supply is nowhere close to what is needed. SII is expected to produce about 70 million doses in May, and Bharat Biotech an additional 20 million. That's a total of 90 million doses a month. They are expected to ramp up further but that will take time.Other vaccines are now in the mix, including Russian-made Sputnik V, which is yet to be approved in Europe. The makers have already signed manufacturing deals with a host of Indian companies but the infrastructure and approvals for making a vaccine take time. So for now, India is importing the vaccine from Russia and it's expected to be rolled out in June.All of this means there will be a supply crunch at least for the next few months. Of course, there was a lot the federal government or even states could have done to ramp up vaccine manufacturing ahead of time.""If plan A doesn't work, you should be ready with plan B,"" says Mahesh Zagade, former health secretary of Maharashtra, one of India's worst-hit states.It's a question many have asked - and the answer seems to be that no-one was preparing for a second wave.""Our numbers were low and there was this constant narrative that India had beaten Covid,"" says virologist Shahid Jameel. If vaccination had kept pace through February and March, he adds, the second wave would have been far less intense.Experts also recommend a localised drive - that is, targeting the most vulnerable - the elderly or those with co-morbidities - in places where infections are growing fast.But to do that requires deep district and village-level surveillance and response, which virologists have said has been lacking since the start of the pandemic.Mr Zagade says breaking up populations into administrative units as small as 25,000 makes it easier to enforce social distancing and enrol people for vaccination by going door-to-door if needed. Instead, the government relied on people registering online or walking in to get their jabs.So the vaccine drive began to lag even as cases rose, driven up by lax safety protocols and massive public events, from elections to festivals.And there was no plan B because plan A was based on an assumption that has been proved wrong - that there would be no second wave at all.Charts by Shadab Nazmi",Covaxin,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-56912977,BBC,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""framing"", ""reason"": ""The article frames the government's decision to expand vaccination to 18-44 year olds as a mistake, citing experts who say they should have finished vaccinating people above 45 first.

23,How India is readying for its massive vaccine drive,"On 16 January, India will begin what will be one of the world's biggest inoculation programmes, aimed at protecting its 1.3 billion people from Covid-19.The government plans to vaccinate 300 million people by early August. It will begin with an estimated 10 million health workers, followed by policemen, soldiers, municipal and other frontline workers.Next in line for the jab would be people aged over 50 and anyone under 50 with serious underlying health conditions.India has recorded the second-highest number of Covid-19 infections in the world, after the US. Since the pandemic began it has confirmed more than 10.3 million cases and over 150,000 deaths.The country's drugs regulator has given the green light to two vaccines - Covishield that has been developed by AstraZeneca with Oxford University and Covaxin by local firm Bharat Biotech.",Covaxin,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-55467980,BBC,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""source"", ""reason"": ""The article relies on the government's plan and statistics without providing a counter-view from independent sources."", ""confidence"": 0.8}",no,None,No bias
24,"India records 400,000 Covid deaths","The number of deaths linked to coronavirus in India has moved past the 400,000 mark as the country tries to speed up its vaccination drive.Experts warn that the real number of fatalities might be much higher as many deaths are not officially recorded.India is only the third in the world behind the US and Brazil to record more than 400,000 deaths.The country has recorded 30 million cases - second only to the US.The number of average daily cases in India has fallen to just over 40,000 in recent days, down from the peaks of 400,000 in May. The drop in numbers has largely been attributed to strict lockdowns by states.But experts have warned of an impending third wave.On Friday, the federal government sent a team of experts to six states - Kerala, Arunachal Pradesh, Tripura, Odisha, Chhattisgarh and Manipur - that are seeing a rise in cases. They will assess the situation and monitor the vaccination programme in these states.Less than 5% of the country's population has been fully vaccinated since the beginning of the drive in January.The government aims to vaccinate all Indians by the end of this year, but the drive has been hobbled by slow pace, shortage of doses and vaccine hesitancy.The country is currently using two homegrown vaccines: Covishield and Covaxin. Russia's Sputnik V has been also approved for use and is being used in some quantities.The government is now racing to shore up its vaccine supplies, hoping to be well-prepared after a deadly second wave overwhelmed the country's fragile healthcare system.It is gearing up to use a local version of Novavax vaccine, which will be produced by the Serum Institute of India (SII).

25,PM Modi gets jab as India scales up Covid fight,"Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has received the coronavirus jab as the country opened its vaccination programme for the wider population.India launched its vaccination drive on 16 January, but it was limited to healthcare workers and frontline staff.Now, people over 60 and those who are between 45 and 59 but have other illnesses can get vaccinated.State-run hospitals will offer free jabs but people can also pay at private facilities to get vaccinated.Mr Modi, who's 70 years old, was among the first to get his vaccine shot on Monday. He was administered a jab of Covaxin, an indigenously developed vaccine.After receiving the jab, he took to Twitter, urging people to take the vaccine when their turn came.""Took my first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine at Aiims [hospital]. Remarkable how our doctors and scientists have worked in quick time to strengthen the global fight against Covid-19. I appeal to all those who are eligible to take the vaccine. Together, let us make India Covid-19 free,"" he tweeted.The government aims to cover 300 million ""priority people"" by the end of July.But the pace of vaccination has been slow - so far only 14 million doses have been given and experts say unless the drive is scaled up, the target could be missed.The country's drugs regulator has given the green light to two vaccines - one developed by AstraZeneca with Oxford University (Covishield) and one by Indian firm Bharat Biotech (Covaxin).Several others candidates are at different stages of trials. Officials have said they hoped to use a ""bouquet of vaccines"" to speed up the vaccination drive in the coming months.Since the pandemic began, India has confirmed more than 11 million cases and over 157,000 deaths.Much of India has reported a sharp fall in cases recently - with daily infections for the county falling to less than 20,000 from a peak of over 90,000 in September.But a handful of states have recently reported a sharp uptick in the number of cases.Experts have blamed ""carelessness"" in following Covid safety norms behind the rise.

26,India approves world's first DNA Covid vaccine,"India's drug regulator has approved the world's first DNA vaccine against Covid-19 for emergency use.The three-dose ZyCoV-D vaccine prevented symptomatic disease in 66% of those vaccinated, according to an interim study quoted by the vaccine maker Cadila Healthcare.The firm plans to make up to 120 million doses of India's second home-grown vaccine every year.Previous DNA vaccines have worked well in animals but not humans.India has so far given more than 570 million doses of three previously approved vaccines - Covishield, Covaxin and Sputnik V.About 13% of adults have been fully vaccinated and 47% have received at least one shot since the beginning of the drive in January.Cadila Healthcare said it had conducted the largest clinical trial for the vaccine in India so far, involving 28,000 volunteers in more than 50 centres.This is also the first time, the firm claimed, a Covid-19 vaccine had been tested in young people in India - 1,000 people belonging to the 12-18 age group. The jab was found to be ""safe and very well tolerated"" in this age group.The key third phase of clinical trials was conducted at the peak of the deadly second wave of the virus. The vaccine maker believes this reaffirmed the jab's ""efficacy against the mutant strains"", especially the highly infectious Delta variant.""I am quite excited about the vaccine because it offers a lot of good potential. If this jab works, the future of vaccination becomes logistically simpler,"" said Prof Shahid Jameel, a well-known virologist.DNA and RNA are building blocks of life. They are molecules that carry that genetic information which are passed on from parents to children.Like other vaccines, a DNA vaccine, once administered, teaches the body's immune system to fight the real virus.ZyCoV-D uses plasmids or small rings of DNA, that contain genetic information, to deliver the jab between two layers of the skin.The plasmids carry information to the cells to make the ""spike protein"", which the virus uses to latch on and enter human cells.Most Covid-19 vaccines work by giving the body instructions to make a fragment of the spike protein so it can trigger a person's immune system to produce antibodies and teach itself to fight off the virus.This is the world's first human DNA vaccine against Covid-19.There are a number of DNA vaccines approved in the US, for example, for use in animals, including a vaccine for a disease in horses and a skin cancer vaccine for dogs.However, more than 160 different DNA vaccines are being tested in human clinical trials in the US. Most are devoted to treating existing cancers, and a third of the vaccines were for treating HIV.ZyCov-D is also India's first needle-free Covid-19 jab.It is administered with a disposable needle-free injector, which uses a narrow stream of the fluid to penetrate the skin and deliver the jab to the proper tissue.""To have a DNA vaccine which works against an infection is a big deal. If it gives good protection this is something India will be proud of,"" said Dr Gagandeep Kang, a virologist and the first Indian woman to be elected Fellow of the Royal Society of London.Scientists say DNA vaccines are relatively cheap, safe and stable.They can also be stored at higher temperatures - 2 to 8C.Cadila Healthcare claims that their vaccine had shown ""good stability"" at 25C for at least three months - this would help the vaccine to be transported and stored easily.DNA vaccines developed for infectious diseases in humans have failed in the past.""The problem is they work well in animals. But they don't end up offering the same level of immune response protection in humans,"" said Dr Kang.The challenge, according to Dr Kang, was how to push the plasmid DNA into the human cell so that it gives a durable immune response.Dr Jeremy Kamil, a virologist at Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center in Shreveport, echoed a similar sentiment.""Plasmid DNA vaccines have been tried in the past. But we know it's very difficult to get plasmid DNA into the nucleus of human cells, especially in adults,"" Dr Kamil told me.mRNA vaccines - which use messenger RNA, a molecule, to make the  proteins - like Pfizer or Moderna do not need to reach the nucleus of the cell to be effective and offer higher efficacy and are likely to produce longer lasting immunity.The other potential drawback is that ZyCoV-D requires three doses, instead of two for the other two candidates being used in India.  The vaccine maker says it is evaluating at a two-dose jab.""I would be delighted that a vaccine company overcame the immense challenges to make it work. But it's imperative that the efficacy data be vetted independently,"" said Dr Kamil.",Covaxin,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-57774294,BBC,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""source"", ""reason"": ""The article relies heavily on statements from Cadila Healthcare and quotes from two virologists who are likely to be favorable towards the vaccine.

27,India scientists warn against Covid vaccine rush,"A group of Indian scientists has warned a deadline to launch a Covid-19 vaccine for public use is unfeasible.The Indian Academy of Sciences warned against ""any hasty solution that may compromise rigorous scientific processes and standards"".The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) had said it ""envisaged"" the vaccine to be launched by 15 August, which is India's Independence Day.The ICMR has since said the date was ""not a deadline"".The controversy first arose after a letter written by ICMR chief Balram Bhargava to 12 institutes selected for conducting human trials for the vaccine - named Covaxin - was shared widely on social media.In it, he had directed them to expedite human trials so that the vaccine could be launched on 15 August by fast-tracking all approvals related to it.Non-compliance, the letter warned, would be treated ""very seriously"".Adding to the confusion, a statement by the Ministry of Science and Technology deleted a line from an earlier statement that said it was unlikely that any of the vaccines under development in the country - including Covaxin - are likely to be ready for public use before 2021.This led to a firestorm of protest and criticism, with many saying that the 15 August deadline was nothing but optics and would seriously damage India's credibility.Prof Partha P Majumder, president of the Indian Academy of Sciences, told local media that the trial period of a month announced by the ICMR was ""unheard of"", adding that it ""gives a bad name to the industry of biomedical research and pharmaceuticals"".However, the ICMR has since sought to clarify its comments, saying that the 15 August date was ""not a deadline"" and was merely an attempt to cut red tape - not an attempt to compromise on safety trials.India's Mint newspaper quoted an anonymous ICMR official as saying that the initial communication had been misunderstood.A vaccine would normally take years, if not decades, to develop. However, researchers across the world are hoping to achieve the same amount of work in only a few months.Most experts think a vaccine is likely to become available by mid-2021, about 12-18 months after the new virus, known officially as Sars-CoV-2, first emerged.Even that would be a huge scientific feat and there are no guarantees it will work.",Covaxin,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-53304576,BBC,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""tonality"", ""reason"": ""The article's tone is critical of the ICMR and the government, using words like 'firestorm', 'protest', and 'damage' to describe their actions."", ""confidence"": 0.8}",yes,tonality,"critical of the ICMR and the government, using words like 'firestorm', 'protest', and 'damage'"
28,Is the world's vaccine powerhouse running out of doses?,"For the past two days, Sanjay Kumar has been trying to get himself and his ageing mother vaccinated against coronavirus in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh.""I called up three private hospitals in my neighbourhood and all of them said they had run out of doses,"" says Dr Kumar, a social scientist, who lives in Ghaziabad, on the outskirts of Delhi.One of them is a 50-bed neighbourhood hospital. ""We have zero stock of vaccines and are not taking bookings because people come for jabs and get into fights (when we tell them we have no stocks),"" a front office worker said. At another hospital where Dr Kumar unsuccessfully sought a booking, officials said they had run out of doses on Wednesday evening. ""We have no other option but to turn people away,"" an employee said.As India grapples with a deadly second wave of Covid-19 infections - with an average of more than 90,000 cases daily from 1 April - its vaccination drive appears to be struggling. Half a dozen states are reporting a shortage of doses even as the federal government insists that there's enough in stock.In the western state of Maharashtra, which is reporting more than half of India's new infections, the inoculation programme appears to be grinding to a halt. The local government says its current stock of 1.5 million doses will last only for three days. Vaccination centres have been shut in the state capital, Mumbai, and parts of Kolhapur, Sangli and Satara districts. ""If the vaccines don't come in three days, we will be forced to stop the drive,"" state Health Minister Rajesh Tope told reporters.Federal Health Minister Harsh Vardhan says the ""allegations"" of vaccine scarcity are ""utterly baseless"" - more than 40 million doses are ""in stock or nearing delivery"", he claims. He blames states for trying to ""divert attention from their poor vaccination efforts by just continuously shifting the goalposts"". Mr Vardhan believes the states which are complaining of shortages have not even fully vaccinated their frontline workers.That may not be entirely true. Vaccine shortages seem to be a reality in some states who have managed to vaccinate quickly, according to Oommen C Kurian of the Observer Research Foundation, a Delhi-based think tank. He told me that the shortage might be triggered by a ""mismatch between the claimed production capacity of Indian vaccine makers and the actual produced doses over the last four months or so"".India's vaccination drive, the world's biggest, began on 16 January, and aims to cover 250 million people by July. Initially limited to healthcare workers and frontline staff, it has been since extended in stages to people above 60; those between 45 and 59 who have other illnesses; and those above 45.More than 90 million doses of two approved vaccines - one developed by AstraZeneca with Oxford University (Covishield) and one by Indian firm Bharat BioTech (Covaxin) - have been given so far. An average of three million jabs are being administered daily. Also, India has so far shipped 64 million doses of vaccines to 85 countries. Some are in form of ""gifts"", others in line with commercial agreements signed between the vaccine makers and the recipient nations, and the rest under the Covax scheme, which is led by the World Health Organisation (WHO).When it comes to vaccine manufacture, India is a powerhouse. It runs a massive immunisation programme, makes 60% of the world's vaccines and is home to half a dozen major manufacturers, including the Serum Institute of India - the largest in the world. But a large-scale adult vaccination programme against a virulent pathogen like SARS-Cov2, the virus that causes Covid-19, is posing unprecedented challenges.For one, experts say the vaccination drive needs to pick up a lot more pace in order to meet its target. It is not clear whether the country has enough vaccines and state capacity to expand the drive.The key question, as many have been speculating, is whether India has enough stock of doses to speed up the drive and expand coverage to include the young. Some are wondering whether India did the right thing by sending millions of doses abroad as part of its much hyped ""vaccine diplomacy"".Serum Institute of India, which makes the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, known locally as Covishield, has provided some clues. This week, it said its production capacity was ""very stressed"". Adar Poonawalla, the head of the firm, said in an interview on Indian television that ""we are still short of being able to supply to every Indian.""Serum says it has been providing 65-70 million doses every month to India, and exported a total of nearly an equal amount of doses since it began production early this year.In January the firm told the BBC that it was aiming to boost production to 100 million doses a month. Now it says it would not be able to meet the target before the end of June because of time taken to repair damages from a fire at its facilities in the western city of Pune in January. Then Mr Poonawalla had said there would be no impact on the production of Covishield, ""due to multiple production buildings that I had kept in reserve to deal with such contingencies"".The firm says a squeeze on finances is also hampering the drive to ramp up production. Mr Poonawala is seeking $400m (£290m) in government assistance or bank finance to invest in expanding capacity. Serum is selling a dose of the vaccine at $2 to India's government  and ""this rate is not enough to sustain further expansion,"" he says.""This was not budget or planned initially because we were supposed to export [more] and get the funding from exporting countries. Now that is not happening and we have to find other innovative ways to build our capacity, so we can support our nation in light of the surge in cases,"" Mr Poonawala told NDTV.Clearly, India's vaccine ""shortage"" will have a worldwide impact.Last month India placed a temporary hold on all exports of the Oxford-AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine. Serum says it shipped 30 million doses to Covax in January and February - half of its capacity - and now there's a shortfall of ""30-40 million [export] doses"".""We have told them the need [for doses] is India is so severe that we need to prioritise Indian needs over that of exports,"" Mr Poonawala told CNBC-TV18. He also told Business Standard newspaper that Astra Zeneca had sent his firm a ""legal notice (for delays in supplying the vaccine) and the Indian government is also aware of that"".Experts say the vaccine shortages in parts of India could be because of supply bottlenecks. Vaccine makers had also possibly ""oversold"" their capacities while taking orders from all over the world.  ""As the cases rise and vaccine hesitancy falls, the demand for doses will increase. We have to plan better,"" says a senior official, who preferred to remain unnamed.At the moment, India doesn't have too many options. A new vaccine - possibly Sputnik V - is expected to be approved by June. Covovax, another coronavirus vaccine being developed by Serum Institute in partnership with American vaccine developer Novavax, is not expected to be available before September.So India has to prioritise jabs. There's no other way to bring down the number of people dying of Covid-19 than to speedily provide shots to more than 120 million of India's elderly. This needs to be done in the next few weeks, with the help of local governments, civil society, including religious leaders and backed by focused communication campaigns, says Mr Kurien.",Covaxin,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-56659206,BBC,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""framing"", ""reason"": ""The article frames the issue as a 'shortage' of vaccines in India, which may be seen as sensational and biased.

29,How India's vaccine drive went horribly wrong,"It took 31-year-old Sneha Marathe half a day to book an appointment online for a Covid vaccine.""It was a game of 'fastest finger first',"" she says. ""The slots filled up in three seconds."" But the hospital cancelled her slot at the last minute: they had no vaccines. Ms Marathe went back to try for another appointment.All 18-44 year-olds in India have to register on the government's CoWin platform to get vaccinated. With demand for jabs far outstripping supply, tech-savvy Indians are even writing code to corner elusive appointments.Ms Marathe can't code, but she is among millions of Indians who are on the right side of the country's digital divide - unlike hundreds of millions of others who don't have access to smartphones or the internet, currently the only route to a jab.Prime Minister Narendra Modi's federal government has opened up vaccinations for some 960 million eligible Indians without having anything close to the required supply - more than 1.8 billion doses.Worse, the severe shortage comes amid a deadly second Covid wave and warnings of an impending third wave.A cocktail of blunders - poor planning, piecemeal procuring and unregulated pricing - by Mr Modi's government has turned India's vaccine drive into a deeply unfair competition, public health experts told the BBC.How did the world's largest vaccine manufacturer, often dubbed the ""pharmacy of the world"" for generic drugs, end up with so few vaccines for itself?""India waited till January to place orders for its vaccines when it could have pre-ordered them much earlier. And it procured such paltry amounts,"" says Achal Prabhala, a co-ordinator with AccessIBSA, which campaigns for access to medicines in India, Brazil and South Africa.Between January and May 2021, India bought roughly 350 million doses of the two approved vaccines - the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab, manufactured as Covishield by the Serum Institute of India (SII), and Covaxin by Indian firm Bharat Biotech. At $2 per dose, they were among the cheapest in the world, but not nearly enough to inoculate even 20% of the country's population.Declaring that India had defeated Covid, Mr Modi even took to ""vaccine diplomacy"", exporting more jabs than were administered in India by March.Contrast that with the US or EU, who pre-ordered more doses than they required nearly a year before the vaccines became available for immunisation.""This guaranteed vaccine manufacturers a market, gave them certainty to forecast supply and sales, and ensured that some of these governments got large quantities as quickly as possible, once the vaccines were ready,"" Mr Prabhala says.Unlike the US and the UK, India also waited until 20 April - well into the second wave - to extend a $610m financing line to SII and Bharat Biotech to boost production.Another failure, according to Malini Aisola, co-convener of the All India Drug Action Network, was the decision not to enlist the vast swathe of India's manufacturing capabilities - biologics factories, for instance, that could have been repurposed into vaccine production lines.Again, four firms, including three government-owned ones, have only recently been given rights to make Covaxin, which is partially publicly-funded.On the other hand, by early April, Russian developers of Sputnik V, had inked manufacturing deals with a host of Indian pharma companies, which are set to produce the vaccine.As the sole buyer initially, the federal government could have held far greater leverage over pricing, Ms Aisola says.""Centralised bulk procurement would have allowed the price to come down from $2. Instead it has gone up,"" she adds.This is because since 1 May, it has been up to individual states and private hospitals to broker their own deals with manufacturers.Opposition parties have called it a ""scam"", saying the federal government had abdicated its responsibility, opening up ""debilitating competition among states"".States have to pay double - $4 - the federal government's rate for a dose of Covishield and four times as much for Covaxin - $8. This was after the two companies lowered prices for states as a ""philanthropic gesture"". States are also competing for scarce stocks alongside private hospitals, which can pass on the costs to customers.The result: a veritable free market for vaccines that have been developed and manufactured with both public and private funding. At private hospitals, a single dose can now cost up to 1,500 rupees ($20; £14).Several states have now announced plans to import other vaccines from Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson. But no manufacturer is able to guarantee supply in the next few months since richer countries have pre-ordered stocks.Sputnik V has been approved, but it's still unclear when the vaccines will be rolled out.Some have accused SII and Bharat Biotech of ""profiteering"" during a pandemic, especially after receiving public funding.But others say they took substantial risks and that the fault lies with the government. India is the only country where the federal government is not the sole buyer, and one of the few where vaccinations are not free.But public health experts agree that SII and Bharat Biotech need to be more transparent about their manufacturing costs and their commercial contracts.Ms Aisola says SII needs to disclose how it spent the $300m it received from the international Covax scheme and the Gates Foundation, funding which was meant to finance vaccines for low-income countries. SII has failed to do so, partly because India banned exports. The company is also fielding a legal notice from AstraZeneca for defaulting on its promise to send 50% of its supply to low-income countries.Public health experts are also calling for scrutiny of the Indian government's contract with Bharat Biotech, especially since the Indian Council of Medical Research has said it ""shares"" intellectual property (IP) for Covaxin, which it developed along with the company. But the jab costs more - often double - than Covishield.""They say they share IP but what sort of an agreement did they sign? Does it give them [the government] the right to override any clauses in case of an emergency?"" asks Dr Anant Bhan, a public health expert.While India has supported waiving the patents on foreign-made vaccines, it has made no move to suspend it for Covaxin.Contrary to its international position, it has opposed suggestions from opposition leaders to invoke compulsory licensing and allow other pharma companies to manufacture the approved vaccines, saying these measures would prove ""counterproductive"".Dr Bhan agrees that at this stage it would take time to transfer technology and build capacity in other pharma companies - but he also says it's unclear why none of this was attempted earlier.Vaccinating even 70% of India's 1.4 billion people was always going to be a long exercise in planning and patience. But given the country's strong record on immunisation, it was not an impossible task, Dr Bhan says.However, why the government chose to rely on just two companies who can now control supply and dictate prices is a question that few have answers to.Charts by Shadab Nazmi",Covaxin,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-57007004,BBC,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""framing"", ""reason"": ""The article frames the vaccine drive as 'horribly wrong' and highlights a 'cocktail of blunders', creating a negative narrative."", ""confidence"": 0.8}",yes,framing,"frames the vaccine drive as 'horribly wrong' and highlights a 'cocktail of blunders', creating a negative narrative."
30,India second country to cross two billion Covid jabs,"India has administered more than two billion Covid vaccination doses, becoming the second country to hit the milestone after China.""This has strengthened the global fight against Covid-19,"" Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted on Sunday.India's achievement comes amid a rise in Covid cases in many states.The government has asked states to step up surveillance of infections. It has also been trying to expand the booster dose programme across the country.Last week, India began a drive to give free booster doses - or precaution doses, as the government calls it - to all adults for 75 days. The time period is to mark the 75th anniversary of the country's independence on 15 August.Until now, only frontline workers, health workers and people above 60 years were eligible for free booster doses. Others had to pay for it.The move came days after the country cut the gap between the second and third doses of the vaccine to six months from nine.The Hindustan Times newspaper reported last week that 92% of Indians who were eligible for a booster dose haven't taken it yet.Over 55 million booster doses have been administered so far since the programme began in January. The drive was initially open to healthcare and frontline workers, and those above 60 years with comorbidities. It was later expanded to all adults.A vaccine programme for 15- to 18-year-olds began in January, and for 12- to -14-year-olds in March.According to India's health ministry, 98% of adults have received at least one dose of the Covid vaccine, while 90% have been fully vaccinated.China has administered around 3.4 billion doses of the vaccine so far, according to the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center.So far, India has reported around 43.5 million Covid cases, second only to the US, and around 525,242 deaths - behind the US and Brazil.On Monday, the country reported 20,528 daily cases for the past 24 hours, a four-month high.States such as Maharashtra, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal have seen a jump in daily active cases over the past few weeks.India had a slow start when vaccinations were opened for some 960 million eligible adults in January 2021.Logistical problems, supply bottlenecks, vaccine hesitancy and a debilitating second wave of Covid-19 during this period made the rollout harder.But as the situation eased, it managed to ramp up coverage, with tens of thousands of public and private health facilities offering the jab.The country delivered vaccines by drone to far-flung villages in north-east India's mountainous regions.Drones were also used to ferry doses to the eastern archipelago of Andamans and Nicobar where ""transportation by boat"" was taking a long time.Though the programme missed its first, over-ambitious deadline of universal adult vaccination by 31 December 2021, it has hit some milestones like the recent one.On 17 September, India administered more than 20 million doses in a day in a record-breaking effort to mark Prime Minister Narendra Modi's 71st birthday.In October, it crossed the one billion mark, becoming the second country after China to do so.India is currently using four vaccines - the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab, known locally as Covishield; Covaxin by Indian firm Bharat Biotech; Russian-made Sputnik V and Corbevax.Covishield has accounted for around 80% of the doses given to adults so far.Corbevax, which is a protein-based vaccine manufactured by Biological E, got emergency use authorisation from India's drug regulator in February 2022 for the age group of 12-18 years.In June, Covovax - made by the Serum Institute Of India - received approval for restricted emergency use in children aged between seven and 12 years.The government had also authorised  Indian pharma company Cipla to import Moderna's vaccine, which has shown nearly 95% efficacy against Covid-19. But doses of these are yet to be made available to India.In February, it also approved a new single-dose vaccine, Sputnik Light, a component of Sputnik V.People can experience side effects from vaccines.India has a three-decade-old surveillance programme for monitoring ""adverse events"" following immunisation. Experts say a failure to transparently report such incidents could lead to fear-mongering around vaccines.The government told the Supreme Court that the country reported more than 772,000 ""adverse events"" after vaccination as of 13 March 2022.  This included ""minor, serious and severe events"".The serious cases were ""minuscule in number; where vaccines may or may not be the cause of death"".The government has previously said adverse effects may not necessarily be caused by the vaccines, adding that ""the risk of dying following vaccination is negligible compared to the known risk of dying due to Covid-19 disease"".",Covaxin,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-56345591,BBC,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""framing"", ""reason"": ""The article frames India's achievement of administering over two billion Covid vaccination doses as a positive milestone, highlighting the government's efforts and Prime Minister Modi's tweets.

31,India plans to 'begin Covid vaccination in January',"India expects to begin vaccinating people against Covid-19 in January, federal health officials told the BBC.The officials - who requested anonymity - said a few vaccine candidates were likely to get emergency-use authorisation from the drug regulator in the next few weeks.Two companies have already applied for consideration, and six more are in various stages of clinical trials.The vaccination programme aims to reach 300 million people by early August.India has recorded more than 10 million Covid-19 cases and over 145,000 deaths from the disease so far. The vaccination roll-out plans are being made even as the contagion shows marked signs of a slowdown.The Covishield vaccine made by Serum Institute of India, which has partnered with British pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca; and Covaxin, being developed by Bharat Biotech in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) have already applied for authorisation.The other candidates which are in different stages of trials to test safety and efficacy include:Four of these eight vaccines were being developed indigenously, the officials said.The officials also disputed media reports that India had pre-booked millions of doses from a number of  vaccine makers around the world, saying they were already satisfied with the stocks in the country.One official said the government was in ""touch with a number of local and international vaccine makers, informing them about our requirements and finding out about their production capacities"".Two Indian vaccine makers - Serum Institute of India, the world's largest vaccine maker, and Bharat Biotech - alone have the capacity of making 65 million doses a month, they added.India also has a ""good stockpile"" of vaccines, which can be quickly ""converted into vials"" if the candidates get  regulatory approvals, the officials added.Around 300 million Indians will be vaccinated between January and early August, officials said.It will begin with an estimated 10 million health workers, followed by policemen, soldiers, municipal and other front line workers.The next groups eligible for vaccinations would include people above and below 50 years of age with underlying conditions and co-morbidities, officials said.India already runs the world's biggest immunisation programme, inoculating more than 40 million newborns and pregnant women against 12 diseases every year. It also has a well-oiled electronic system to stock and track these vaccines.Officials said 154,000 of the country's 223,000 nurses and midwives engaged in this programme will be deployed to give Covid vaccines to people. It will be also inviting final year nursing students to volunteer.Some 29,000 existing cold storage facilities would be used to stock the vaccines - nearly all vaccines need to be transported and distributed between 2C and 8C in what comprises the so-called cold chain.Officials said extreme cold storage chain facilities - up to -80C - are already available in a number of agricultural and animal husbandry research centres in Haryana, Karnataka and West Bengal, among other places.There have been concerns about how India would monitor ""adverse events"" following immunisation after a controversy involving a vaccine volunteer who sued Serum Institute of India after reportedly falling sick following a trial jab.""We will have to be transparent and address such adverse events.

32,India to begin vaccine rollout on 16 January,"India will launch its vaccination drive against the coronavirus on 16 January, the government has announced.PM Narendra Modi called it a ""landmark step"" and said the aim was to vaccinate 300 million people by July. India has a population of 1.3 billion.Healthcare staff and frontline workers will be among the first to receive doses, he added.India has recorded the second-highest number of Covid-19 infections in the world, after the US.Since the pandemic began it has confirmed more than 10.3 million cases and nearly 150,000 deaths.The country's drugs regulator has given the green light to two vaccines - one developed by AstraZeneca with Oxford University (Covishield) and one by Indian firm Bharat Biotech (Covaxin).""Starting that day [16 January], India's nationwide vaccination drive begins,"" Mr Modi tweeted on Saturday. ""Priority will be given to our brave doctors, healthcare workers [and] frontline workers.""A government statement said that next in line for the jab would be people aged over 50 and anyone under 50 with serious underlying health conditions.Indian health officials have already staged mass trials at vaccination centres across the country. Training has been given to about 150,000 staff in 700 districts.Saturday's announcement came days after experts raised concerns over India's emergency approval of Covaxin before the completion of trials.Health watchdog All India Drug Action Network said there were ""intense concerns arising from the absence of the efficacy data"" as well as a lack of transparency that would ""raise more questions than answers and likely will not reinforce faith in our scientific decision making bodies"".India's Drugs Controller General, VG Somani, insisted Covaxin was ""safe and provides a robust immune response"".""The vaccines are 100% safe,"" he said, adding that side effects such as ""mild fever, pain and allergy are common for every vaccine"".The regulator said the vaccine had been approved for ""restricted use in emergency situation in public interest as an abundant precaution, in clinical trial mode, especially in the context of infection by mutant strains"".Krishna Ella, chairman of Bharat Biotech, said the approval of Covaxin had not been rushed.""Under Indian laws we can get emergency approval for the vaccine based on fulfilling five parameters after Phase 2 trails. That is what has happened with our vaccine. So it is not a premature approval,"" he said.""We will complete the Phase 3 trials soon and provide the efficacy data for the vaccine by February.""",Covaxin,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-55603620,BBC,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""omission"", ""reason"": ""Lack of critical examination of Covaxin's approval process and potential concerns raised by experts."", ""confidence"": 0.8}",yes,omission,Lack of critical examination of Covaxin's approval process and potential concerns raised by experts.
33,Will Pakistan get Covid vaccines from India?,"Next week, Pakistan plans to launch its immunisation programme against Covid, starting with health workers getting jabs of free doses of a China-made vaccine.Next door, arch-rival India began one of the world's biggest inoculation drives against the disease in mid-January. The vaccine powerhouse - India makes about 60% of vaccines globally - has also begun shipping millions of free doses to friendly neighbours in the region, in what is being described as ""vaccine diplomacy"".Unsurprisingly, Pakistan is not a recipient. The two nuclear-armed rivals have fought three wars since gaining independence from Britain in 1947, with the last war between them taking place in 1971. They came to the brink of war in 2019 over the disputed territory of Kashmir.Pakistan plans to inoculate at least 70% of its 220 million people against Covid free of cost. Regulators have given emergency use approval for three candidates - the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, the China-made Sinopharm and Russian-developed Sputnik V.  Another China-made vaccine CanSino Biologics is in final clinical trials in Pakistan. The country has recorded more than 530,000 infections, and 11,514 deaths from the infection so far.For starters, China has pledged to donate 500,000 doses of the Sinopharm to Pakistan, and the first batches are expected to arrive at the weekend. ""This is nothing. We will need a lot more vaccines,"" Usman Ghani of Sindh Medical Stores, a leading Karachi-based importer of vaccines, told me.To be sure, Pakistan will try to source doses from all over the world, including through the World Health Organisation or WHO's ambitious scheme, Covax, that works towards the development, purchase and delivery of vaccines to more than 180 countries. But there are fears that richer countries could hoard jabs at the expense of poorer ones. That is where India could play a key role in ensuring that its neighbour is not starved of vaccines.Despite the fraught relations, pharmaceutical trade between the two countries has been stable. In 2018, Pakistan's pharma imports from India were estimated at more than $62m (£45m). Some 60-70% of active ingredients contained in medicines sold in Pakistan are imported from India.More importantly, almost 90% of vaccines administered in Pakistan come from India, according to Mr Ghani. Indian vaccines, he adds, are ""world-class, affordable and shipping is easy"". Most of these vaccines are distributed through Pakistan's state-funded immunisation programme which targets 14 million new-borns and pregnant women every year. The children are given jabs against 10 diseases while mothers are inoculated against tetanus.Mr Ghani believes Pakistan will get vaccines from India in the near future. India's drug regulator has given the green light to Covishield (the local name for the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine developed in the UK) and Covaxin, locally made by pharma company Bharat Biotech. ""India already has got so many vaccine orders from all over the world. We have cordial relations with vaccine makers across the border. We will try our best to get supplies, but it will take time,"" Mr Ghani says.An Indian foreign ministry spokesman has said he was not ""aware of any request for India-made vaccines"" from Pakistan. Many believe it is a question of time when India begins supplying doses. ""We will harm ourselves if we don't cooperate on vaccines,"" says Mr Ghani.Meanwhile, Delhi is steaming ahead with its ""vaccine diplomacy"".Last year, senior diplomats of a number of countries were taken on trips to four vaccine makers across the country. This month, India began shipping early free doses to Bhutan, Maldives, Bangladesh, Nepal, Myanmar, Seychelles, Sri Lanka and Bahrain. Commercial supplies have begun to Brazil and Morocco. Countries have appealed to India to lift export controls and provide vaccines at government-facilitated affordable prices. India, a foreign ministry official told me, plans to do it ""case by case"" after assessing local production and demand.Serum Institute of India - the world's largest vaccine maker which is making its vaccine called Covishield in India - has pledged to deliver up to 200 million doses to low and middle-income countries before the end of 2021. More than 20 countries in Asia, Africa and Europe are ""highly interested"" in Covaxin, a spokesperson for Bharat Biotech said. ""There's huge international demand for our vaccines,"" Foreign Secretary Harsh Shringla told Bloomberg TV recently.Many believe India's vaccine diplomacy is a counter to growing Chinese influence in the region. ""India's vaccine diplomacy puts it in direct competition with China - which has made no secret that vaccine distribution is wrapped up in its broader geopolitical ambitions. In fact, it has even explicitly included vaccine distribution in its broader Health Silk Road initiative, which aims to bolster China's international soft power,"" note Harsh Pant and Aarshi Tirkey, researchers at Delhi-based think tank Observer Research Foundation (ORF), in a paper.China's state-affiliated Global Times has run stories on how Indians in China have been ""embracing"" Chinese vaccines, and that India faces challenges in supplying vaccines to the world. Earlier this week, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian downplayed this, saying there was no vaccine competition between the countries.

34,India approves two coronavirus vaccines,"India has formally approved the emergency use of two coronavirus vaccines as it prepares for one of the world's biggest inoculation drives.The drugs regulatory authority gave the green light to the jabs developed by AstraZeneca with Oxford University and by local firm Bharat Biotech.Prime Minister Narendra Modi called it ""a decisive turning point"".India plans to inoculate some 300 million people on a priority list this year.It has recorded the second-highest number of infections in the world, with more than 10.3 million confirmed cases to date. Nearly 150,000 people have died.On Saturday India held nationwide drills to prepare more than 90,000 health care workers to administer vaccines across the country, which has a population of 1.3 billion people.The Drugs Controller General of India said both manufacturers had submitted data showing their vaccines were safe to use.However, opposition politicians and some doctors have criticised a lack of transparency in the approval process.Dr Swapneil Parikh, an infectious diseases researcher based in Mumbai, told the BBC doctors were in a difficult position.""I understand there is a need to go through the process quickly, remove regulatory hurdles,"" he said. ""However... [governments and regulators] have a duty to be transparent about the data they have reviewed and the process involved in making the decision to authorise a vaccine, because if they don't do this, it can affect the public's faith in the process.""The Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine is being manufactured locally by the Serum Institute of India, the world's largest vaccine manufacturer. It says it is producing more than 50 million doses a month.Adar Poonawalla, the company's CEO, told the BBC in November that he aimed to ramp up production to 100 million doses a month after receiving regulatory approval.The jab, which is known as Covishield in India, is administered in two doses given between four and 12 weeks apart. It can be safely stored at temperatures of 2C to 8C, about the same as a domestic fridge, and can be delivered in existing health care settings such as doctors' surgeries.This makes it easier to distribute than some of the other vaccines. The jab developed by Pfizer/BioNTech - which is currently being administered in several countries -  must be stored at -70C and can only be moved a limited number of times - a particular challenge in India, where summer temperatures can reach 50C.The local vaccine, however, was approved despite the absence of data on how efficient it can be. It has yet to go through large-scale trials.The Drugs Controller General, V.G. Somani, said Bharat Biotech's Covaxin was ""safe and provides a robust immune response"".Mr Somani said it had been approved ""in public interest as an abundant precaution, in clinical trial mode, to have more options for vaccinations, especially in case of infection by mutant strains"".India, which makes about 60% of vaccines globally, plans to immunise about 300 million people by July 2021. It will prioritise health care workers, the emergency services, and those who are clinically vulnerable because of age or pre-existing conditions.India's existing vaccination programme already reaches about 55 million people a year, administering 390 million free jabs against a dozen diseases. It stocks and tracks the vaccines through a well-oiled electronic system.Pfizer, whose vaccine has already been approved for use in jurisdictions including the UK, the US and the EU, is also seeking emergency authorisation in India.In all, some 30 vaccine candidates are being developed in India.",Covaxin,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-55520658,BBC,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""omission"", ""reason"": ""Lack of critical examination of the approval process and potential biases in the selection of vaccines."", ""confidence"": 0.8}",no,none,no bias
35,India launches its first inhaled Covid vaccine,"India has approved its first nasal Covid vaccine.Made by Bharat Biotech, iNCOVACC is administered in the form of drops and stimulates an immune response in the tissues that line the nasal cavity.In September 2022, China had approved an inhaled Covid vaccine, administered in the form or a spray.Scientists say that nasal vaccines may offer added immunity in the lining of the nose and upper airways, where Covid typically enters the body.Research teams in the UK and the US have also been investigating nasal spray vaccines.In November, India's drug regulator approved the use of iNCOVACC as a heterologous booster dose -  a booster for people who had previously received two doses of Covishied or Covaxin, the two main Indian vaccines - in emergency situations among adults.In December, it was approved by the drug regulator as a primary vaccine and as a subsequent booster shot in adults.The vaccine will cost 800 rupees ($10; £8) per dose in private hospitals and 325 rupees per dose in government hospitals and can be booked on the government's online platform. Two doses are to be taken 28 days apart.iNCOVACC uses a adenovirus as a carrier for the genetic code that teaches the body how to fight the infection. Adenoviruses used in the vaccines are harmless transporters which have been modified so they cannot replicate or cause infection.Dr Krishna Ella, chairman of Bharat Biotech, told ANI news agency that the vaccine was ""easy to deliver"" as it didn't need a syringe or needle, and that it produced a broader immune response as compared to injectable Covid vaccines.India has administered over two billion Covid jabs so far.

36,Tough Covid measures for worst-hit Indian state,"Maharashtra, the Indian state worst affected by the coronavirus, has announced sweeping new restrictions amid a wave of Covid-19 infections.Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray stopped short of calling it a lockdown, but said for the next 15 days, only essential services would function.Mr Thackeray said gatherings of more than four and non-essential travel on public transport would be banned.""The war has begun again,"" the chief minister said at a press conference.""Now is the time for action,"" he added. ""I am not saying a lockdown just now, but strict restrictions. I know bread and butter is important but saving lives is important.""He also acknowledged the need for more oxygen, saying supplies would be sought through the military.Maharashtra is India's richest state and home to its biggest city, Mumbai. It has been the hardest hit in the nation by the coronavirus pandemic. The state reported 51,751 new Covid-19 cases on Monday and 258 deaths.Prime Minister Narendra Modi has reportedly asked specialist teams to visit the state to investigate why there has been such a dramatic spike in case numbers. The state announced tighter restrictions a week ago after India saw its highest day of infections since mid-September, with 93,249 new cases.More than half of those cases were in Maharashtra.Last week's new measures - including a night-time curfew and a ban on public gatherings - will remain during the new 15-day period.About 165,000 people are reported to have died of Covid-19 in India and there have been 12.5 million confirmed infections. The country's mass inoculation drive, the largest in the world, has proceeded at a slower than expected rate - about 100 million doses of the Covishield and Covaxin vaccines have been administered so far, but the government has said it wants to vaccinate 250 million people by July.Also on Tuesday, India authorised the emergency use of Russia's Sputnik V vaccine and agreed to fast-track approval for the Pfizer, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson shots.Sputnik V is the third drug to be approved by India after Oxford-AstraZeneca's Covishield and Covaxin, which was developed by Indian firm Bharat Biotech. Sputnik V's approval came as India overtook Brazil to become the country with the second-highest number of cases globally.India has the largest vaccine manufacturing capacity in the world and exported tens of millions of doses to smaller nations before a spike in cases increased domestic demand.",Covaxin,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-56719311,BBC,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""source"", ""reason"": ""The article relies on official statements from the Indian government and Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray, but does not provide a counter-perspective or critique of the government's handling of the pandemic."", ""confidence"": 0.8}",no,none,no bias
37,Different jabs given to 20 in India vaccine mix up,"Twenty people in north India have been given two different coronavirus jabs for their first and second doses.They were given a shot of Covishield (AstraZeneca) in early April, but then got the locally developed Covaxin as part of their second dose in May.India has not allowed the mixing of vaccines and studies are going on around the world to see if different doses can be safely administered.Officials said the 20 people were healthy and had no side effects.Officials in Siddharthnagar district in Uttar Pradesh state said they had launched an inquiry into the ""administrative oversight"".Sandeep Chaudhary, Chief Medical Officer of Siddharthnagar, told the local NDTV news channel that he had asked for an explanation from ""those who are guilty"" and vowed to take action against them.Some villagers said that they were afraid that the ""vaccine cocktail"" would have an adverse impact on them in the coming weeks.Covaxin is an inactivated vaccine which means that it is made up of killed coronaviruses, making it safe to be injected into the body.Meanwhile Covishield, which is the local name for the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is being manufactured locally by the Serum Institute of India, the world's largest vaccine manufacturer. It is made from a weakened version of a common cold virus (known as an adenovirus) from chimpanzees. It has been modified to look more like coronavirus - although it can't cause illness and is safe.Scientists are still studying if vaccines made on different platforms can be given to the same person.  The ""goof up"" comes amid a severe shortage of vaccines doses across the country.The government has opened vaccinations for everyone above the age of 18 but hasn't procured enough to speed up the drive.The sluggishness of the drive has only exacerbated the impact of a devastating second wave of the virus that has overwhelmed hospitals and even crematoriums in recent weeks.The mix up comes amid a raging second wave of the pandemic. It has become one the worst affected countries with more than 27 million cases.It has also reported more than 300,000 deaths from the virus though experts fear the real number is many times higher.",Covaxin,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-57264622,BBC,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""tonality"", ""reason"": ""Loaded language used: 'goof up', 'administrative oversight', 'guilty'."", ""confidence"": 0.8}",yes,tonality,"language used: 'goof up', 'administrative oversight', 'guilty'"
38,India top court criticises vaccination drive,"India's Supreme Court has sharply criticised the federal government over its coronavirus vaccination programme.The judges asked the government to explain why it was mandatory to register on an app for getting a jab.The court said this would hamper vaccinations across rural India where internet access is difficult.The judges also questioned whether federal policy was making individual states compete against each other for vaccines.India has administered more than 220 million doses since it began vaccinating in mid-January, but so far only 3% of the population has been fully vaccinated.Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government has opened up vaccinations for some 960 million eligible Indians without having anything close to the required supply.The shortage came amid a deadly second Covid wave and warnings of an impending third wave. The wave has since slowed - the number of daily infections has fallen from the peak of over 400,000 last month to 132,788 cases that were recorded in the past 24 hours.The Supreme Court said that asking people between 18-44 years to pay for their jabs was ""arbitrary and irrational"".The court asked the government to review its vaccination policy and ""place on record a roadmap of projected availability of vaccines till 31 December"" - the date by which the government is promising to vaccinate the entire adult population.India says it aims to ramp up vaccine production and has pledged to produce at least two billion doses between August and December.There are currently two locally-made vaccines for the coronavirus: Covishield and Covaxin.The Serum Institute of India (SII) makes Covishield (under licence from AstraZeneca), whilst the second largest producer, Bharat Biotech, makes the locally-developed Covaxin.The Sputnik V vaccine, which was approved for use in April, is also now available, with three million doses supplied by Russia.Of the eight vaccines currently under production in India, only three have been approved for use - another two are in the early stages of clinical trials and a further three are in late-stage trials.Public health experts say poor planning, piecemeal procuring and unregulated pricing by the government has turned India's vaccine drive into a deeply unfair competition for state governments.",Covaxin,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-57340069,BBC,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""tonality"", ""reason"": ""The article uses words like 'sharply criticised', 'hamper vaccinations', and 'arbitrary and irrational' to describe the government's vaccination policy, indicating a negative tone."", ""confidence"": 0.8}",yes,tonality,"words like 'sharply criticised', 'hamper vaccinations', and 'arbitrary and irrational'"
39,India orders 300 million unapproved Covid jabs,"India has ordered 300 million doses of an unapproved coronavirus vaccine amid a devastating second wave.The unnamed vaccine from Indian firm Biological E is in Phase 3 trials, and had showed ""promising results"" in the first two phases, the federal government said in a statement.The $206m order is the first India has signed for a jab that has not received emergency approval.This comes as the country struggles to speed up its lagging vaccine drive.India has administered just over 220 million jabs so far, although much of its 1.4 billion population is now eligible for the vaccine. Less than 15% of the country has received at least one dose of the vaccination, largely because of a severe shortage of doses.Although Covid case numbers have been dropping, India is still adding more than 100,000 news cases a day. It has recorded more than 340,000 deaths from the virus so far, but experts say the number is vastly underestimated.India's federal government, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has been criticised for not placing huge orders ahead of time with either Indian or foreign vaccine makers.India is currently giving three vaccines - Covishield, manufactured by the Serum Institute of India (SII), and Covaxin, developed by Indian firm Bharat Biotech and the government's Indian Council of Medical Research, and Sputnik V, which is developed by Moscow's Gamaleya Institute.Compared to the single order from Biological E for 300 million doses, India brought about 350 million doses from both Covishield and Covaxin between January and May.India's drug regulator gave Covaxin emergency approval in January before trials were completed - data on its efficacy is yet to be released.The new vaccine from Biological E is ""likely to be available in the next few months,"" according to the government.Mr Modi's government is racing to shore up its vaccine stocks as Covid numbers dip, hoping to be well-prepared for what experts say is an inevitable third wave.India's vaccine drive, which had a promising start in January, began to slow down because vaccine hesitancy crept in as cases dropped. But numbers soon rose again in a deadly second wave that saw hospitals falling short of beds and crematoriums running short of space.Hoping to stem the tide, the government threw open the drive in May to everyone above the age of 18 but India's two vaccine makers - Serum Institute and Bharat Biotech - could not guarantee supply at that scale.But shortages persist and have also led to vast inequalities in access with rural areas, the poor and women falling behind in the line for jabs.",Covaxin,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-57354069,BBC,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""selection"", ""reason"": ""The article focuses on the criticism of India's vaccine drive and the government's handling of the pandemic, while also highlighting the shortage of doses.

40,India begins booster shots amid Covid case surge,"India has begun giving booster doses of the Covid-19 vaccine to priority groups amid a surge in infections.Health and frontline workers and people above 60 years old with comorbidities are currently eligible to take the jab.The drive began as India battles a spike in Covid cases fuelled by the Omicron variant of the coronavirus.Early studies from other countries have suggested that a booster vaccine may provide more protection against Omicron.The highly transmissive Omicron variant was first discovered in South Africa in November.Since then, several countries have expanded their booster programmes or shortened the gap between jabs to shore up protection against the variant.In India, the booster shot - dubbed a ""precaution dose"" by Prime Minister Narendra Modi - will be the same vaccine that was given to a person for their first and second doses.India has been mainly administering two locally-manufactured vaccines, Covishield and Covaxin, since its vaccination drive began in January 2021.On Sunday, India reported more than 179,000 new infections for the past 24 hours, driven by a steep rise in cases in big cities such as the national capital Delhi and financial centre Mumbai.On the same day, Mr Modi chaired a review meeting with top officials, and asked for ""technical support"" to be provided to states reporting more cases.The government had begun administering vaccines to 15-18-year-olds last week - it has said that 31% of Indians in this age group have been given the first dose so far.More than 91% adults have been partially vaccinated so far, while 66% have received both doses.But experts say that still leaves millions of unvaccinated people - many with underlying health problems that could increase the severity of the infection - at risk.The spread of Omicron has also increased worries - India has confirmed a total of 4,003 cases of Omicron, with Maharashtra state reporting the highest (1,126), followed by Rajasthan (529) and Delhi (513).The country has so far recorded more than 35 million Covid cases and about 483,000 deaths from the virus.Last year, a devastating second wave overwhelmed the country's health system, leading to a shortage in oxygen, hospital beds and critical drugs.",Covaxin,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-59933028,BBC,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""omission"", ""reason"": ""No mention of Covaxin's efficacy or potential issues compared to other vaccines."", ""confidence"": 0.8}",yes,omission,No mention of Covaxin's efficacy or potential issues compared to other vaccines
41,Human trial of India coronavirus vaccine announced,"Volunteers in India will be immunised with a new locally made coronavirus vaccine in July.An unspecified number of people will have the vaccine, as part of a trial by Hyderabad-based firm Bharat Biotech.Tests in animals suggest the vaccine is safe and triggers an effective immune response.The trials are among many across the world - there are around 120 vaccine programmes under way. Half a dozen Indian firms are developing vaccines.This is the first India-made vaccine and developed from a strain of the virus that was isolated locally and weakened under laboratory conditions.India's drug control authorities have allowed Bharat Biotech to hold Phase 1 and 2 of clinical human trials after ""company submitted results generated from preclinical studies, demonstrating safety and immune response"", a statement issued by the firm added.The two trials are designed to test whether the vaccine is safe, rather than whether it is effective.The locally obtained strain of the virus was instrumental in developing the vaccine quickly, the firm said.""The difference between the strains present globally is something still being researched,"" a spokesperson for the vaccine maker told the BBC.The vaccine is called Covaxin and has been locally developed in collaboration with India's National Institute of Virology and Indian Council of Medical Research, according to Dr Krishna Ella, chairman of Bharat Biotech.The firm, which has delivered more than 4 billion doses of vaccines worldwide, has developed vaccines for H1N1 and rotavirus, among other diseases.Apart from Bharat Biotech, Zydus Cadilla is working on two vaccines, while Biological E, Indian Immunologicals, and Mynvax are developing a vaccine each. Another four or five home-grown vaccines are in early stages of development.Pune-based Serum Institute of India, the world's largest vaccine maker by number of doses produced and sold globally, has also partnered to mass produce a vaccine being developed by the University of Oxford and backed by the UK government.India is among the largest manufacturer of generic drugs and vaccines in the world.It is home to half a dozen major vaccine makers and a host of smaller ones, making doses against polio, meningitis, pneumonia, rotavirus, BCG, measles, mumps and rubella, among other diseases.Correspondents say a vaccine would normally take years, if not decades, to develop.Most experts think a coronavirus vaccine is likely to become available by mid-2021, about 12-18 months after the new virus, known officially as Sars-CoV-2, first emerged.That would be a huge scientific feat and there are no guarantees it will work, correspondents say.",Covaxin,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-53230607,BBC,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""source"", ""reason"": ""The article relies heavily on Bharat Biotech's statement and spokesperson, without providing counter-sources or critical perspectives."", ""confidence"": 0.8}",yes,source,relies heavily on Bharat Biotech's statement and spokesperson
42,India begins world's biggest Covid vaccine drive,"A sanitation worker became the first Indian to receive a Covid vaccine as the country began the world's largest inoculation drive.Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the programme, which aims to vaccinate more than 1.3 billion people against Covid.He paid tribute to front-line workers who will be the first to receive jabs.India has recorded the second-highest number of Covid-19 infections in the world after the United States.Millions of doses of two approved vaccines - Covishield and Covaxin - were shipped across the country in the days leading up to the start of the drive.""We are launching the world's biggest vaccination drive and it shows the world our capability,"" Mr Modi, said, addressing the country on Saturday morning.He added that India was well prepared to vaccinate its population with the help of an app, which would help the government track the drive and ensure that nobody was left out.Mr Modi spoke at length about doctors, nurses and other front-line workers ""who showed us the light"" in ""dark times"".""They stayed away from their families to serve humanity. And hundreds of them never went home. They gave their life to save others. And that is why the first jabs are being given to healthcare workers - this is our way of paying respect to them.""Geeta Pandey, BBC News, DelhiDoctors and medical staff at Delhi's Max hospital tell me a lot of hope is being pinned on the vaccination drive. One official described it ""as a new dawn"" and said ""it's the beginning of Covid's end"".Inside the waiting room, there are posters on the wall with information about the documents one needs to bring, how safe the vaccine is, and the precautions that need to be taken even after one's been vaccinated.  Among those being vaccinated on Saturday are doctors, nurses and front-office staff from all departments.The names have been been chosen alphabetically so those getting jabs are mostly those with names starting with the letter A.""The pandemic has played havoc in the country. I hope the vaccine will rid us of the fears and we will be able to breathe easy,"" Dr Anil Dass said after getting the jab.Ashutosh Chaturvedi, a 31-year-old male nurse described as a ""Covid warrior"" by hospital officials, became the first recipient of the vaccine at Max.""I'm fine, I feel good,"" he told reporters as he came down the hospital ramp, which has been decorated with blue, green and white balloons.Since April, he told me, he's worked in the emergency wing of the Covid ward, tending to those afflicted with the coronavirus.""I haven't seen my wife and nine-month-old daughter since then. A month later, once I've received the second dose, I'll visit my family,"" he said.Mr Modi also appealed to people to continue adhering to Covid-19 safety protocols like wearing masks and following social distancing. He said the country cannot afford to be complacent as vaccinating the entire population will take time.He also urged people not to believe any ""propaganda and rumours about the safety of the vaccines"".""I want to tell people that the approval to these vaccines was given only after scientists and experts were satisfied about its safety,"" he said.An estimated 10 million health workers will be vaccinated in the first round, followed by policemen, soldiers, municipal and other front-line workers.Next in line will be people aged over 50 and anyone under 50 with serious underlying health conditions. India's electoral rolls, which contain details of some 900 million voters, will be used to identify eligible recipients.The government plans to vaccinate 300 million people by early August. This will happen in state-run health care centres, schools, colleges, community halls, municipal offices and wedding halls.Several hospitals across India are giving the first doses of the vaccine.Dr Atul Peters was among those who got the jab at Max hospital.""It's a very big day. I'm grateful to those who worked hard to make this a reality. I was very very happy when I got a call informing me that my name was on the list.""We worked hard during the pandemic to save lives and we are also taking the jab first to dispel fears in people's minds that the vaccine is not safe,"" he told the BBC.India's drug regulator has given the green light to two vaccines - Covishield (the local name for the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine developed in the UK) and Covaxin, locally-made by pharma company Bharat Biotech.But concerns have been raised over the efficacy of Covaxin because the regulator's emergency approval came before the completion of Phase 3 clinical trials. The regulator and the manufacturer have said the vaccine is safe, and that the efficacy data would be available by February.Both vaccines will be given as two injections, 28 days apart, with the second dose being a booster. Immunity would begin to kick in after the first dose but reaches its full effect 14 days after the second dose.The status of the vaccines and recipients will be electronically tracked in real time - some 8 million people who will receive the early jabs have been already registered. More than 600,000 people have been trained for the drive.The jabs will be voluntary, and recipients will be given a certificate of vaccination after they complete both doses.""I expect India's vaccination programme will be run much better than most countries because of the considerable government investment and early preparedness,"" Dr Gagandeep Kang, one of India's best-known vaccine experts, told the BBC.With more than 10 million cases, India has recorded the second-highest number of Covid-19 infections in the world, after the US.The largest vaccination drive in the country, however, begins at a time when infections have fallen sharply, and much of life has returned to normal. A limited availability of doses in the initial phase, therefore, is not likely to pose a problem.Most scientists feel India is primed for the challenge as it is a vaccine-making powerhouse and has run, for decades, a well-oiled immunisation programme for tens of millions of new-borns and mothers-to-be.But the real challenges will begin when the general population starts receiving the jabs.India will use its formidable election machinery to deliver and track doses to recipients in far corners of the country. It is also likely to use digital platforms and apps to enable people to register for the doses.However, not every Indian owns a smart phone or knows how to operate an app, so it will be interesting to see what the government does to make sure that there are no inadvertent exclusions.Vaccine hesitancy is the other concern.The recent controversy over the hurried approval of Covaxin, many feel, could undermine confidence. There's a history of hesitancy about receiving the polio vaccine in parts of northern India, triggered by rumours about vaccines being impure and affecting fertility. Similar disinformation is now circulating about Covid vaccines on social networking apps, such as WhatsApp.The government will need consistent, clear-eyed communication to bolster vaccine acceptance and community perception of the programme.Vaccines come with side effects for some people. India has a 34-year-old surveillance programme for monitoring such ""adverse events"" following immunisation.But researchers have found that benchmarks for reporting side effects still remain weak. A failure to transparently report adverse effects could easily lead to fear-mongering around vaccines.",Covaxin,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-55632782,BBC,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""source"", ""reason"": ""The article relies heavily on statements from the Indian government and its officials, such as Prime Minister Narendra Modi, without providing a balanced view with counter-sources."", ""confidence"": 0.8}",no,none,no source bias
43,Why did India rush to approve a homegrown vaccine?,"How can a coronavirus vaccine be cleared for emergency use by millions of vulnerable people in a ""clinical trial"" mode?No idea, says Dr Gagandeep Kang, one of India's best-known vaccine experts. ""Either you are doing a clinical trial or not"". Clinical trials - a three-phased process - determine whether the vaccine induces good immune responses and whether it causes any unacceptable side-effects.On Sunday, India's drug regulator gave emergency approval of a locally produced coronavirus vaccine, called Covaxin, before the completion of trials. The government-backed vaccine has been developed by Bharat Biotech, a 24-year-old vaccine maker, which has a portfolio of 16 vaccines and exports to 123 countries.The regulator said the vaccine had been approved for ""restricted use in emergency situation in public interest as an abundant precaution, in clinical trial mode, especially in the context of infection by mutant strains"". (The regulator also approved the global AstraZeneca Oxford jab, which is also being produced in India.)This, despite the fact that the key third phase of Covaxin's clinical trials - the vaccine is given to thousands of people and tested for efficacy and safety - was underway.Assurances by the regulator that the vaccine is ""safe and provides a robust immune response"" have not placated most scientists and health experts. All India Drug Action Network, a watchdog, said it was ""baffled to understand the scientific logic"" to approve ""an incompletely studied vaccine"".Bharat Biotech says it has a stockpile of 20 million doses of Covaxin, and is aiming to make 700 million doses out of its four facilities in two cities by the end of the year. ""Our vaccine is 200% safe,"" says Dr Krishna Ella, chairman of the firm.Dr Ella has defended the approval. For one, he said, Indian clinical trial laws allowed ""accelerated"" authorisation for use of drugs after the second phase of trials for ""unmet medical needs of serious and life-threatening diseases in the country"". The fact that his vaccine was based on an inactivated form of coronavirus - a reliable and time-tested platform - also helped.Studies on monkeys and hamsters had shown that Covaxin provided ample protection against the infection, Dr Ella said. Nearly 24,000 of the 26,000 volunteers had already participated in the ongoing third phase trials, and the firm was expected to have the efficacy data for the vaccine by February, he added.Scientists are sceptical. ""Since there is no data for the third phase of trials, we don't know how efficacious this vaccine is. We know it is safe, going by the limited phase two trials. What if we roll out a vaccine with unknown efficacy and later find it to be only 50% efficacious? Would it be fair to people who received it?"" Dr Shahid Jameel, a leading virologist, told me.It is still not clear what the regulator meant by saying that the vaccine would be administered in a ""clinical trial mode"". In a conventional trial, volunteers are not told whether they are given the vaccine or a placebo, and many are excluded from participating because of pre-existing health conditions.Dr Ella said his firm will monitor the recipients after they've taken Covaxin jabs. This is likely to add to the logistics of the vaccination programme.So did the regulator actually mean Covaxin would be administered to people in a ""fourth phase of clinical trials"" for ongoing studies after the vaccine is approved and marketed? ""Give us some time to understand the whole thing. We don't know whether this will be treated as a trial,"" Dr Ella said.That's not all.A senior member of the federal Covid-19 taskforce muddied the waters further by saying that Covaxin would be ""like a back-up [vaccine]"" in the event of a sharp spike in cases. Epidemiologists I spoke to say they are baffled. ""Does it mean that in the event of a surge, some people will be given a vaccine of unproven efficacy?"" a senior epidemiologist said.However, Prof Paul Griffin, an expert in infectious diseases at the University of Queensland, says it is not unheard of vaccines to be used in emergency circumstances in a targeted way whilst still under a clinical trial framework. This is usually considered if the ongoing trials are robust and if the data from earlier trials supports the vaccine's expanded use ""both in terms of safety as well as efficacy"", he told me.With more than 10 million coronavirus infections, India has the second highest number of reported cases after the US. The pandemic has battered its economy. India plans to vaccinate some 300 million people between January and July. But the rollout is also happening at a time when cases have slowed down considerably. Bharat Biotech is a well-known vaccine maker, with a track record of clinical trials in 20 countries, involving more than 700,000 volunteers.So why could India not wait for a few weeks more for the final trials to be over and approved a vaccine of proven efficacy? Why this haste?""It is incomprehensible,"" Shashi Tharoor, a senior opposition politician and MP, told me.Mr Tharoor blames this ""unseemly haste"" on Narendra Modi's BJP government ""which enjoys placing slogans over substance"". In this case, he says, ""chest-thumping 'vaccine nationalism' - combined with the PM's ""self-reliant India"" campaigning - trumped common sense and a generation of established scientific protocols"". Others say ""poor science communication"" and a lack of transparency by regulatory officials had also contributed to this fiasco.India is a vaccine-making powerhouse, making 60% of the world's vaccines. It runs the world's largest immunisation programme targeting 55 million people - mainly newborns and pregnant women - who receive some 390 million free doses of vaccines against a dozen diseases every year.The Covaxin fiasco holds many lessons for India.As the virus devises ways to grow more infectious, a number of vaccines may be needed to counter it and prevent severe disease among infected people.""Approval for all vaccines must be provided on the basis of adequate evidence of efficacy and safety. Clarity on tested and approved doses and dosing schedules too is needed in that context,"" K Srinath Reddy, president of the Public Health Foundation of India, told me.""It is in the interest of science and public confidence that all concerns related to any vaccine are adequately addressed. We cannot win this battle if we doubt the weapons that are being handed to us,"" he added.",Covaxin,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-55534902,BBC,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""framing"", ""reason"": ""The article frames the approval of Covaxin as 'haste' and 'unseemly', implying that the government's decision was driven by politics rather than science."", ""confidence"": 0.8}",yes,framing," frames the approval of Covaxin as 'haste' and 'unseemly', implying that the government's decision was driven by politics"

45,Debunking false vaccine claims spreading in India,"India started its Covid vaccination programme on 16 January, and in the days before and since then, various claims about vaccines have been doing the rounds on social media.The government has urged people to have the vaccines, and to ignore ""rumours and disinformation"".Here's the truth behind some widely-shared claims.A politician from the northern state of Uttar Pradesh recently claimed this - but offered no evidence at all.Ashutosh Sinha, of the opposition Samajwadi Party, has said: ""I think the vaccine may contain something which can cause harm. You can become impotent, anything can happen.""The party's leader, Akhilesh Yadav, has previously cast doubt about the jabs, describing them as the ""BJP vaccine"" - a reference to India's ruling party.But there is no proof that vaccines make you impotent, and these claims have been dubbed ""absolute rubbish"" by India's top drugs regulator.It has said that the vaccines are safe, although they may cause some side effects such as mild fever, and aches and pains.The country's Health Minister Dr Harsh Vardhan has also refuted the claim.This is not the first time impotency rumours have circulated around a vaccine programme in India.When the country was conducting its massive polio eradication drive several decades ago, some Indians were dissuaded from having a vaccine because of similar rumours.There was no truth to the claims then, and there's no evidence for them now either.Another widely-shared, but inaccurate, claim compares India favourably with both the the US and England, saying that the vaccine is free in India, while in both the US and in England you will pay.One Twitter user posted that the US vaccine would cost 5,000 rupees (£50; $69) and in England it would cost 3,000 rupees, apparently to show India's vaccine programme in a more favourable light compared with those in the US and England.This was picked up and tweeted by a Hindi-language TV channel, ABP News, but then taken down. The figures are not at all accurate.The US federal government has said that Covid vaccines will be free, although there may be a charge for administering the jab.But many Americans would be able to cover this charge through various health insurance schemes, and those without insurance would be covered by a special Covid relief fund. So they will not need to pay.It's also incorrect about England, which is part of the UK's National Health Service, where there are no charges for vaccines. The service is funded through taxation, and healthcare is free to the patient.It's true that in its initial phase (which covers health workers and frontline staff), India's vaccination programme will be free of charge for those getting the jabs.  The government has yet to clarify what happens after that.The Indian government has made special arrangements with vaccine suppliers to bring prices down, at least for the initial consignments.Some Islamic scholars in India have said that no Muslim should have Covid vaccines, claiming that they could contain pork products.But neither of the two vaccines being rolled out in India has such products in them.Pork gelatine has sometimes been used as a stabiliser in vaccines for some diseases - and the consumption of pork products is forbidden in Islam.The issue gained a lot of traction on Twitter after a widely-shared post advising Muslims that Covid vaccines were not certified as ""halal"" (conforms to Islamic law) - although it didn't specify which particular vaccines.There's currently only two vaccines which have been granted approval in India - Covishield (the local name for the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine developed in the UK) and Covaxin, locally made by Bharat Biotech.Neither uses pork gelatine.Two other major Covid vaccines, produced by Pfizer and Moderna, are similarly free of pork gelatine.Some of the claims about vaccine ingredients refer to ones made by Chinese companies, but currently there is no Chinese vaccine approved for use in India.There have been controversies over Chinese vaccines in other countries, for example in Muslim-majority Indonesia where the local Islamic authorities decided the Chinese-produced Sinovac vaccine was allowed.As in other parts of the world, conspiracy theories falsely claiming that the vaccines contain microchips have been doing the rounds on Indian social media.One short video shows a Muslim cleric saying that the vaccine has a chip in it which will control your mind.The video went viral on Facebook and Twitter earlier this month.Microchips aren't part of any vaccines, although this claim has cropped up repeatedly in conspiracy-minded groups around the world.Read more from Reality CheckSend us your questions",Covaxin,https://www.bbc.com/news/55768656,BBC,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""labeling"", ""reason"": ""Loaded labels 'absolute rubbish' and 'conspiracy theories' applied asymmetrically to claims made by opposition politicians and social media users, respectively."", ""confidence"": 0.8}",yes,labelling, labels 'absolute rubbish' and 'conspiracy theories' applied asymmetrically to claims made by opposition politicians and social media users
46,"'I have cancer in my 30s, but can't get a Covid jab'","When 37-year-old Shikha Goel was diagnosed with breast cancer three months ago, life came to a grinding halt.The Delhi-based founder of fashion label Ilk had to reorganise everything around her.Her work, her friends and her future plans momentarily took a backseat.The initial shock was too much to handle, but she picked herself up and decided to fight the disease with support from her family and friends.She launched a social media initiative to encourage more women to routinely get screened for breast cancer. What followed was an urgent surgery and prolonged rounds of chemotherapy.She visited hospitals several times in the first month and ""it was all going fine"". But then the number of Covid-19 cases started rising in several states, including Delhi.She frantically began scouring the internet for information on Covid-19 and cancer. Soon she realised that she was at higher risk of infection and, if she caught the virus, the consequences could be dangerous.The possibility of a ""double whammy"" frightened her, but also strengthened her precautionary measures while visiting hospitals.She says vaccination is the more ""secure way"" of keeping Covid away, but she can't get the jab because she is not eligible for it.And she is not alone - India has tens of thousands of young patients who are in the high risk category and need vaccination urgently.But India is yet to allow people under the age of 45 to get vaccinated even if they are diagnosed with a life-threatening disease, which makes them more vulnerable to a Covid infection.This was ""heart-breaking"" for Shikha, who contacted several hospitals to get vaccinated but wasn't successful. She says she will keep trying ""to check with different hospitals until she finds a way out"".""I am doing well in beating the dreaded cancer and I am on the mend, but the risk of Covid doesn't let me sleep,"" she says.She still has several rounds of chemotherapy left, which can only happen in hospitals where the risk of getting Covid is high.And cancer patients like her are especially vulnerable.The European Society For Medical Oncology has advised governments across the world that cancer patients should be prioritised - irrespective of their age - during Covid vaccination drives.A study published in Nature has also advised countries to prioritise vaccination for specific cancers.Several countries like the UK have been prioritising high-risk groups such as patients with specific cancers. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has also recommended vaccination for people (16-64) with underlying medical conditions, which increases the risk of serious, life-threatening complications from Covid-19.Prominent Indian oncologist Dr Ganapathi Bhat, who has treated hundreds of cancer patients, says it's concerning that the government has not allowed younger cancer patients to get vaccinated.He says cancer patients are immunocompromised, they are at high risk for severe Covid-19 infection and outcomes include delayed recovery and higher mortality rates.""Therefore, it is utmost priority to protect their health, so that they continue their treatment without interruption,"" he says.Some have argued that a blanket permission to allow all cancer patients to get Covid jabs is not feasible.Dr Bhat says patients of acute leukaemia and those undergoing stem cell transplant need expert advice before they can be vaccinated against Covid.But doctors are not allowed to make that decision at the moment. Dr Bhat says treating oncologists should have the choice to prescribe Covid jabs to their younger patients after clinical evaluation.Shikha says her doctor has advised her to get vaccinated ""as soon as possible as he is really worried"".""The hunt for the vaccine has been draining,"" she says, adding that being diagnosed with cancer causes ""unimaginable physiological stress"".""But not getting the vaccine has increased that stress a thousand times more. We deserve better care,"" she adds.The Indian government on Tuesday opened vaccination for people between the age of 45 and 59, but it did not say anything about the high-risk category under the age of 45.It said further relaxation would be announced when the current phase of the drive is complete.Doctors agree that cancer patients are more at risk because hospital-acquired Covid-19 is a reality.Dr Om Shrivastava, a prominent infectious diseases specialist, says that many patients suffering from life-threatening diseases have to visit hospitals for procedures like chemotherapy.""They are always at risk of contracting Covid at hospitals and getting them vaccinated should be picked up urgently,"" he says.But he also adds that he understands why the government did not include younger people with comorbidities in the first round of vaccination.""Supply was limited initially and they had to calibrate,"" he says.More than 55 million doses of coronavirus vaccines have been administered so far. Nearly 40 million people have received one dose, and over eight million people have been fully vaccinated after receiving two doses.Dr Shrivastava believes ""now is the time to focus on vulnerable groups under the age of 45"".Dr Bhat agrees, adding that a separate policy has to be made for cancer patients which looks at critical issues like finding out the right interval needed between the two doses of the two vaccines - Covishield (AstraZeneca) and ingenious Covaxin - which have been approved in India.A recent study by King's College London and Francis Crick Institute found that ""antibody responses at week three, following the first dose of the vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech) were only 39% and 13% in the solid and haematological cancers, compared to 97% in those without cancer"".But the study found that when the same patients were given the second dose of the jab three weeks after the first one, ""the immune response improved significantly for solid cancer patients with 95% of them showing detectable antibodies within just two weeks"".""By contrast, those who did not get a vaccine boost at three weeks did not see any real improvement,"" it concluded.India has recently increased the interval between the two jabs from 4-6 weeks to 4-8 weeks, but there is no separate policy for high-risk patients in any age group at the moment.And it's not just young cancer patients who require urgent vaccination. India has tens of thousands of chronic kidney disease patients who also require frequent hospital visits for dialysis.Professor A Fathahudeen, who heads the pulmonology department at the Ernakulam Medical College in Kerala state, says he saw many such patients pick up the coronavirus infection from hospitals during the first wave of the pandemic in June.""Such patients [who are under the age of 45] need to be prioritised urgently. Not many can afford getting dialysis at home, and we can't leave them to their fate, they need our help,"" he says.""I can argue that a 30-year-old cancer or chronic kidney disease patient is as much at risk as a 50-year-old manageable diabetes patient.""Sarath KB, 33, is one such patient. He requires three dialysis sessions per week and the risk of getting Covid worries him.""I want the government to open up vaccination for high-risk patients - irrespective of age groups,"" he says.Shikha agrees.""We can only worry about one thing at a time, give us a fighting chance against Covid.""",Covaxin,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-56522068,BBC,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""omission"", ""reason"": ""The article highlights the struggles of young cancer patients in getting vaccinated, but does not provide a counter-perspective from the government or health officials on why vaccination is not allowed for this age group"", ""confidence"": 0.8}",yes,omission, does not provide a counter-perspective from the government or health officials on why vaccination is not allowed for this age group
47,India to start vaccinating all adults over 18,"India has widened its vaccination programme as infections surge and the capital goes into lockdown.All adults over the age of 18 will be offered a coronavirus jab starting from 1 May, the government said on Monday.However, with vaccines in short supply in many states, it is unclear where the additional doses will come from.The government said last week that it only had 27 million doses - or enough jabs for nine days at current rates of vaccination.India is currently vaccinating health workers, front line workers and people over 45, but a number of states - including the worst-affected Maharashtra state - have reported insufficient supply. There have been reports of people being turned away from vaccination centres in many areas.Vaccine suppliers such as the Serum Institute of India have been unable to meet international requirements and have also warned of raw material shortages affecting production. The institute's CEO pointed to US export bans on specific items needed to make vaccines.The process so far has been controlled by the federal government, but the government is changing the rules, a move it says will increase production and availability and attract more domestic and foreign players.Vaccine manufacturers will now have to supply 50% of the doses to the central government and the rest to state governments and the open market at a pre-determined price.Three vaccines were initially approved for use in India - two manufactured by Indian companies Serum Institute and Bharat Biotech, and the third Russia's Sputnik V.  Since then, it has said that vaccines approved for use in other countries could also be used in India.The government has also approved a $600m (£428m) grant for Serum Institute and Bharat Biotech.India has been reporting around 200,000 cases daily since 15 April - this is well past its peak last year, when it was averaging around 93,000 cases a day.Deaths too have been rising. The government confirmed 1,619 deaths from the virus on Monday.The capital Delhi ordered a six-day lockdown from Monday with city hospitals reporting shortages of beds, oxygen and key medicine.Over the weekend, Delhi's Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal tweeted saying that oxygen has become an emergency in Delhi. ""In view of sharply increasing cases, Delhi needs much more than normal supply,"" he said.Several major cities have made similar complaints.This has prompted officials to start using the country's vast rail network to start ferrying oxygen around the country in special trains.The first train with seven tankers left from Mumbai in the western state of Maharashtra and is expected to reach Vizag in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh.Many states have diverted industrial oxygen to be used for medical purposes.",Covaxin,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-56797689,BBC,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""omission"", ""reason"": ""Lack of critical analysis on government's decision to widen vaccination programme and potential implications."", ""confidence"": 0.8}",no,none,no omission bias
48,Why India's Covid crisis matters to the whole world,"The harrowing scenes from India have shocked the world, as the country struggles with soaring cases of Covid.But the outbreak isn't just a crisis for India - it's a crisis for everyone.""The virus doesn't respect borders, or nationalities, or age, or sex or religion,"" says Dr Soumya Swaminathan, the World Health Organization's chief scientist.""And what's playing out in India now unfortunately has been played out in other countries.""The pandemic has revealed just how interconnected the world is. And if a country has very high levels of infection, then it's likely to spread to other countries.Even with travel restrictions, multiple tests and quarantine, infections can still leak out; and if a traveller has come from somewhere where the virus is very prevalent, they have a higher chance of taking the virus with them. On a recent flight from New Delhi to Hong Kong about 50 passengers tested positive for Covid-19.But there's another concern with India's high infection rates: variants.A new variant has emerged in India called B.1.617. It's been dubbed by some as the ""double mutant"" because of two key mutations on the spike of the virus. There's some lab evidence that suggests it's slightly more transmissible and that antibodies may find it harder to block the virus, but scientists are still assessing how much immunity is lost.""I don't think there's any evidence that it's an escape mutation [which would mean] it fundamentally can't be stopped by the vaccines,"" Dr Jeff Barrett, director of the Covid-19 Genomics Initiative at the Wellcome Sanger Institute, told BBC News.""I think we have to obviously watch carefully, but there's at present no reason to panic about it.""But the higher the number of Covid cases a country has, the more likely it is that new variants will emerge. That's because every single infection gives the virus a chance to evolve and a major concern is that mutations could arise that render vaccines ineffective.""The way to limit viral variants emerging in the first place is to prevent the virus replicating in us… so the best way to control variants is actually to control the global amount of disease that we have at the moment,"" explains Prof Sharon Peacock, Director of the Covid-19 Genomics UK consortium (Cog-UK).Lockdowns and social distancing measures will do this - but vaccination is also vital.This is happening slowly in India: so far less than 10% of its population have had the first dose of the vaccine and less than 2% are fully vaccinated.This is despite the fact that it's home to the world's biggest vaccine manufacturer - the Serum Institute of India. And this is another reason why India's surge in cases has a knock-on effect for the rest of the world.In March, as infections in India started to surge, authorities there halted large exports of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine.That included vaccines for the UN-backed Covax scheme to provide doses to low and middle-income countries. On Monday, the Global Vaccine Alliance (Gavi), which is a partner in the scheme, said it was waiting to hear when supplies from India would resume.This will certainly impact on vaccination roll-outs in many countries. But it means more of India's vaccines are diverted for domestic use, while it tries to ramp up production.And with India's dire situation, scientists say this is a priority.""We really need to double down on vaccination as quickly as possible or the virus is going to try and do everything it can to keep on spreading from person to person,"" says Swaminathan.Globally, the pandemic shows no sign of easing, with the virus devastating country after country.The situation in India is a bleak reminder that none of us will be safe until everyone is safe.Follow Rebecca on Twitter",Covaxin,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-56907007,BBC,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""tonality"", ""reason"": ""The article's tone is sympathetic and alarmist, using words like 'harrowing', 'crisis for everyone', and 'bleak reminder' to describe the situation in India."", ""confidence"": 0.8}",yes,tonality,"using words like 'harrowing', 'crisis for everyone', and 'bleak reminder' to describe the situation in India."
49,Seven EU countries approve India's Covid vaccines,"Seven EU countries have approved India's vaccines for arriving travellers, sources told the BBC.Covishield is now eligible for travel to Austria, Germany, Slovenia, Greece, Ireland and Spain.Iceland and Switzerland too have made the jab eligible for travel to the countries, sources said.Separately, Estonia has confirmed that it will recognise all the vaccines authorised by India for incoming travellers, sources said.Earlier, sources told the BBC that India would not recognise a EU vaccine pass for travellers unless the bloc does the same for India's own vaccine certificate.The move had come amid reports that Covishield was not yet eligible for EU's digital green certificate set to launch on Thursday. The certificate is currently for EU citizens only.Covishield is the Indian-made version of AstraZeneca's Vaxzevria jab, which has been authorised in the EU.The vaccines currently eligible for the green pass have all been approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA).A source in India's external affairs ministry earlier said India had requested EU states to individually consider extending the exemption to people who had taken Covid-19 vaccines in India - Covishield and Covaxin - and ""accept the vaccination certificate"" issued by the government.India had conveyed to EU states that Delhi would ""institute a reciprocal policy for recognition of the EU digital Covid certificate,"" the source said.""Right now, our understanding is that this certificate is meant for travel within the EU. But it could become the norm for all international travel. Nothing changes currently because most international travel is suspended. These certificates will become important when all travel resumes. We are saying, we will accept each other's certificates reciprocally. Why are you discriminating against our certification?,"" one of the sources said.The pass will help do away with the need for quarantines or further testing for travellers between the EU's 27 countries and four associated European nations - Iceland, Norway, Switzerland and Liechtenstein.Covishield was listed for emergency use by the WHO in February.India has so far overwhelmingly administered Covishield jabs - they account for more than 290 million of the 350 or so million vaccinations given so far.With the total case tally of more than 30 million, India is now only behind the United States which has reported over 34 million cases. The number of daily cases has come down to less than 40,000 from the peaks of 400,000 in May. But experts have warned that the threat of a possible third wave still looms.The country has officially recorded close to 400,000 deaths - behind the US and Brazil.Only 4.6% of the people have been fully vaccinated and 21% have received one dose since the beginning of the drive in January.",Covaxin,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-57628123,BBC,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""source"", ""reason"": ""Sources in India's external affairs ministry are quoted extensively without counter-sources from the EU."", ""confidence"": 0.8}",no,none,no source bias
50,UK eases Covid travel restrictions for Indians,"The UK has eased travel restrictions for fully vaccinated Indians who have received a UK-approved jab.Starting 11 October, they will not have to self-isolate or take a Covid test when they arrive in the UK.The move is a relief to thousands of Indians who travel to the UK for work, studies and leisure.The change in guidelines came days after Delhi imposed reciprocal measures on British nationals in retaliation for UK travel curbs on Indian citizens.Trouble has been brewing for some time between the two countries over Covishield, the Indian-made version of the AstraZeneca vaccine that is identical to the doses given to millions of Britons.The UK had earlier refused to recognise Covishield. So, fully vaccinated Indian travellers had to still isolate for 10 days and take Covid-19 tests - at their own expense - before they were allowed to leave quarantine.After outrage in India against what many called ""a discriminatory rule"", UK designated Covishield an approved jab last month.But it did not add India to its exempt-from-quarantine list and the travel restrictions continued. Similarly-vaccinated travellers to the UK from many other countries were not facing the same restrictions.This led to a backlash from Delhi, which imposed a mandatory quarantine last week for fully vaccinated British nationals travelling to India.Britain's decision to ease travel restrictions for Indians comes at a time when India's daily cases have fallen from a peak of 400,000 during a devastating second wave in May to around 21,000 on Thursday.About 26% of India's eligible population has been fully vaccinated and nearly 70% have received at least one dose.Covishield, locally produced by the Serum Institute of India, has been the main vaccine, with some 819 million doses given so far.Most others have received Covaxin, an Indian-made government-backed jab, which has not been approved by the WHO yet.",Covaxin,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-58706237,BBC,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""source"", ""reason"": ""The article relies on unnamed sources for the 'outrage in India' and 'backlash from Delhi', which may indicate a preference for Indian perspectives."", ""confidence"": 0.6}",yes,source,"The article relies on unnamed sources for the 'outrage in India' and 'backlash from Delhi', which may indicate a preference for Indian perspectives."
51,Concern over 'rushed' approval for India Covid jab,"Experts have raised concerns over India's emergency approval of a locally-produced coronavirus vaccine before the completion of trials.On Sunday, Delhi approved the vaccine - known as Covaxin - as well as the global AstraZeneca Oxford jab, which is also being manufactured in India.Prime Minister Narendra Modi touted the approval as a ""game changer"".The head of Bharat Biotech, which makes Covaxin, defended the approval process, but health experts warn it was rushed.Health watchdog All India Drug Action Network said it was ""shocked"".It said that there were ""intense concerns arising from the absence of the efficacy data"" as well a lack of transparency that would ""raise more questions than answers and likely will not reinforce faith in our scientific decision making bodies"".The statement came after India's Drugs Controller General, VG Somani, insisted Covaxin was ""safe and provides a robust immune response"".He added the vaccines had been approved for restricted use in ""public interest as an abundant precaution, in clinical trial mode, to have more options for vaccinations, especially in case of infection by mutant strains"".""The vaccines are 100% safe,"" he said, adding that side effects such as ""mild fever, pain and allergy are common for every vaccine"".The All India Drug Action Network, however, said it was ""baffled to understand the scientific logic"" to approve ""an incompletely studied vaccine"".One of India's most eminent medical experts, Dr Gagandeep Kang, told the Times of India newspaper that she had ""not seen anything like this before"". She added that ""there is absolutely no efficacy data that has been presented or published"".Even social media users were quick to point out that approving the vaccine before trials were complete was a matter of concern irrespective of how safe or effective the vaccine eventually turned out to be.But Krishna Ella, chairman of Bharat Biotech, met reporters on Monday and said the approval of Covaxin had not been rushed. He cited previous examples where emergency authorisation approvals had been given based only on immunogenicity data.""Under Indian laws we can get emergency approval for the vaccine based on fulfilling five parameters after Phase 2 trails. That is what has happened with our vaccine. So it is not a premature approval,"" he said.""We will complete the Phase 3 trials soon and provide the efficacy data for the vaccine by February.""The company currently has 20 million doses available and plans to produce about 700 million doses this year, Dr Ella said.""We have four facilities coming up and we are planning [to make] around 200 million doses in Hyderabad, 500 million doses in other cities.""Vikas Pandey, BBC News, DelhiMany scientists and opposition politicians have raised questions over what they say is the hasty authorisation of Covaxin.Bharat Biotech has developed the vaccine with the state-run Indian Council of Medical Research - and the effort has been touted as an example of India's might in vaccine development and production.Regulators say the vaccine is safe and effective. The firm says phase 1 and phase 2 trials have shown good results.But scientists say that the government's decision not to release data on the vaccine's efficacy for peer review has raised concerns.Mr Modi has welcomed the approval, saying Covaxin is a shining example of his ambitious Atmnirbhar (self-reliance) India campaign.But experts worry that questions over the approval process don't bode well for the campaign. And there could be deeper issues. Many believe that the government needs to be more transparent about the authorisation process because the success of the Covid-19 vaccine programme depends on public trust.The emergency authorisation also sparked a fierce debate on Indian Twitter on Sunday night between ministers and opposition leaders.India's health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan called out opposition leaders for failing to ""applaud"" the country's ""prowess""  in locally producing a vaccine. India makes about 60% of vaccines globally.Members of the main opposition Congress party, Shashi Tharoor and Jairam Ramesh, and former chief minister of Uttar Pradesh state, Akhilesh Yadav, were among those who raised concerns about the manner in which Covaxin was approved.The approval comes as India gears up to vaccinate its population of more than 1.3 billon people. Amid fears that richer countries are buying up much of the vaccine supply, India too appears to be stockpiling vaccines.In an  interview with the Associated Press, Adar Poonawalla, whose Serum Institute of India (SII) is manufacturing the  AstraZeneca Oxford vaccine, said the jab was given emergency authorisation on the condition that it would not be exported outside India.Mr Poonawalla said his company, the world's largest vaccine maker, was also not allowed to sell the shot in the private market.This has raised concerns in India's neighbouring countries, including Nepal and Bangladesh, which were primarily depending on the SII to start vaccinating their populations.Bangladesh had already ordered 30 million doses of the vaccine in the first phase, Reuters reported, but now the fate of the order is unclear. The country's health secretary told local media in December that it expected the first batch of the jab by February.India plans to vaccinate some 300 million people on a priority list by August.It has recorded the second-highest number of infections in the world, with more than 10.3 million confirmed cases to date. Nearly 150,000 people have died.Both vaccines approved on Sunday can be transported and stored at normal refrigeration temperatures.",Covaxin,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-55526123,BBC,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""framing"", ""reason"": ""The article frames the approval of Covaxin as 'rushed' and raises concerns about its safety and efficacy, while also highlighting the government's decision to approve it without releasing data on its efficacy for peer re"", ""confidence"": 0.8}",yes,framing, frames the approval of Covaxin as 'rushed' and raises concerns about its safety and efficacy
52,Why has India missed its vaccine target?,"India has missed the target of giving its entire adult population of 940 million two vaccinations by the end of 2021.The target was first announced by Prakash Javadekar in May, who was a minister in the federal government at the time.""Vaccination in India will be completed by December 2021,"" he said.As of 30 December, 64% of India's adult population was fully vaccinated and around 90% had received the first dose.Experts said achieving full vaccination coverage would take a long time.Dr Chandrakant Lahariya, an epidemiologist and health systems specialist, says the target set by the government was ""unrealistic"" because achieving 100% vaccine coverage at any given point would not be possible.""There would always be some people who are unwilling to get vaccinated for various reasons,"" he said.Weekly vaccinations have slowed since the first week of December, according to India's vaccine dashboard - CoWin.Since mid-October, more second doses have been given than first doses.The daily vaccination numbers have been fluctuating with the highest number achieved on Prime Minister Narendra Modi's birthday on 17 September.Over 20 million jabs were administered on that day, but the country has not been able to achieve the same number since.The monthly average for September was around 8.1 million doses a day, but fell to 5.4 million in October and was 5.7 million in November.Some experts say that if the September momentum had been kept up, India could have been closer to the target, but that demand would eventually have fallen.The vaccination drive, which started in January, faced challenges such as supply constraints due to raw materials shortages, logistical issues and vaccine hesitancy.By the second half of the year, the supply constraints had been addressed.The challenge is now demand rather than the supply. ""The vaccination drive has slowed down now because people are hesitant to take the vaccine,"" says Dr Lahariya.On 3 November, the government launched a programme to conduct at-home inoculations.A month after the programme was announced, first dose coverage had only increased by 6% and second dose coverage by 12%.Mr Modi has now asked states to ramp up vaccinations in districts with low uptake amid fears about the spread of the more transmissible Omicron variant.Over the past few months, the 100% target has not been mentioned in any of the press conferences by the health ministry.We asked the ministry about missing the target, but did not hear back.India is currently administering two locally-manufactured vaccines, Covishield and Covaxin, and the Russian vaccine, Sputnik.India's largest vaccine maker, the Serum Institute of India (SII), was manufacturing 250 million doses of Covishield a month before the company announced production cuts in December due to a lack of orders.It now produces between 125 and 150 million doses a month.Bharat Biotech, the manufacturer of Covaxin, makes 50 to 60 million doses a month.India's health minister, Mansukh Mandaviya, recently said in parliament that states had a stock of 170 million vaccines as of 20 December.He added that vaccine manufacturing capacity would rise from the current 310 million doses a month to 450 million doses a month in the next two months.This may include vaccines from other manufacturers. The junior minister of health, Dr Bharati Pawar, said: ""Both companies [Bharat Biotech and SII] have achieved 90% of their production capacity.""The government has announced jabs for children aged 15 to 18 years and a booster programme for health workers and those above 60 years with other health conditions starting this month.SII chief, Adar Poonawalla, said earlier this month that the company has 500 million vaccines in stock in case the government announces a booster programme.The health ministry has said that around 6.2 million doses have been wasted since the start of the vaccine programme, which is considerably below the number that the World Health Organisation (WHO) would expect to be wasted.There are other Indian-made vaccines expected to be used against Covid.Novavax, developed in the US and named Covavax in India, is being manufactured by SII - and has been granted emergency use listing by the WHO. It has also been granted approval by India.SII has told the BBC that it is currently stockpiling these vaccine doses, and the capacities to manufacture this vaccine would be separate from Covishield.Bharat Biotech has sought approval for trials of its intranasal vaccine as a booster shot.Corbevax, manufactured by Biological-E, has also been granted approval in India.India did give emergency use approval to the US-made Moderna vaccine in June, but so far no doses have been sent to India.Johnson & Johnson's single dose vaccine was granted approval in August, but so far it hasn't been administered.Supplies of foreign-made vaccines are facing legal hurdles over the manufacturers' desire for protection against potential claims arising out of using the vaccines - something no vaccine maker in India has at the moment.What about vaccine exports?With vaccine demand in India slowing and daily cases falling, SII resumed exporting vaccines in November to Covax, the global vaccine-sharing programme.Before exports were halted by India in April, Covax was reliant on supplies from SII to support the vaccine programmes in low and middle-income countries.But exports have been slow and Covax has since relied on other vaccines.Of the 700 million vaccines that have been delivered to 144 countries by Covax as of 14 December, around 40 million doses were provided by SII.Around 28 million of those doses were supplied between January and April 2021, according to Covax.Read more from Reality CheckSend us your questions",Covaxin,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-55571793,BBC,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""omission"", ""reason"": ""The article does not mention the government's reasons for setting an unrealistic target, nor does it provide a balanced view of the challenges faced by the vaccination drive.

53,WHO backs India's Covaxin for emergency Covid use,"The World Health Organization (WHO) has granted approval for emergency use to India's government-backed Covid-19 vaccine, Covaxin.The vaccine was approved in India in January while the third phase of clinical trials was still under way, sparking some concern and criticism.Bharat Biotech, which makes the vaccine, has since published data suggesting 78% efficacy.The WHO said in a tweet it believed the benefits far outweighed the risks.Some experts had pointed to a fast-track approval and incomplete data, but the firm's chairman, Dr Krishna Ella, said the vaccine was ""200% safe"".The WHO's expert panel, which authorises emergency approvals, had asked for more data last month while examining the application Bharat Biotech had filed in July.In its approval it said:The approval will also be a relief to the tens of millions of Indians who have received the jab - India has administered more than 105 million Covaxin doses so far - and a fillip for Bharat Biotech.Few countries have recognised Covaxin and India hopes the WHO approval will change that.How that will play out on travel restrictions for vaccinated Indians remains unclear.Covishield, the Indian-made version of Astrazeneca, remains the most popular jab, accounting for most of India's 810 million jabs. It has been approved by the WHO but the UK recognised the jab only after a refusal to do so sparked anger in India.India has so far fully vaccinated more than 253 million people - about a quarter of its eligible population.And some 653 million people - about 70% - have had at least one dose of a Covid vaccine so far.",Covaxin,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-58800168,BBC,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""tonality"", ""reason"": ""The article's tone is generally neutral and informative, but it uses phrases like 'some concern and criticism' to frame the opposition to Covaxin's approval in a more positive light."", ""confidence"": 0.8}",no,none,no tonality bias
54,Indian man has taken at least eight Covid jabs,"A man in India got jabbed with a Covid-19 vaccine at least eight times last year, a health official said.Brahmdeo Mandal, 65, has claimed that he received 11 doses of the vaccine in Bihar state.The retired postman said the jabs had helped him to get rid of aches and pains and ""stay healthy"". He claimed he had not suffered any adverse effects.Mr Mondal was finally stopped from taking what he claimed was his 12th jab at a camp last week.A probe is underway to find out how Mr Mandal, who lives with his family in Madhepura district, managed to get multiple jabs.""We have already found evidence that he took eight jabs from four places,"" Amarendra Pratap Shahi, civil surgeon of Madhepura, told the BBC.Since vaccination began on 16 January last year, India has been mainly administering two locally-manufactured vaccines, Covishield and Covaxin. The two-dose vaccines have a gap from 12-16 weeks and four to six weeks after the first dose respectively.Vaccination is voluntary, and more than 90,000 centres, mostly state-run, are offering jabs across the country.These include vaccination camps offering walk-in jabs without prior online registration. The beneficiary needs to furnish identity proof - a biometric card, voter ID or driving licence, among 10 documents - to register.The data gathered from the sites is uploaded to India's vaccine portal, CoWin.Early investigations had found that Mr Mandal had managed to take ""two jabs in a half hour gap"" on the same day and each of these jabs ""were registered on the portal"".""We are flummoxed how this could happen. There seems to be a portal failure happening. We are also trying to find out whether there was any negligence by people manning the vaccination centres,"" Mr Shahi said.Public health expert Chandrakant Lahariya told the BBC that the ""only way"" this can happen is if the vaccination data from the sites is uploaded on the portal after a long lag.""But I still wonder it was not detected after so many jabs over so long a time.""Mr Mandal, who kept detailed handwritten notes of the dates, timings and camps, claims he received 11 doses between February and December last year.He told the BBC that he travelled to vaccination camps across Madhepura and even to at least two neighbouring districts - one more than 100km (62 miles) away - to get the jabs. He used different identity cards to register at these sites.Mr Mandal said he had been a ""practising quack"" in his village before taking up a postman's job and ""knew a thing about diseases"".""After taking the jabs my body aches and pain disappeared. I used to have knee pain and walked with a stick. Now I don't. I feel fine.""Fever, headache, fatigue and pain -  mostly mild to moderate - are the most commonly reported side effects after getting a Covid-19 vaccine. Severe allergic reactions are rarer.""You will usually get these reactions after the first and the second dose. Multiple doses of these vaccines should be fairly harmless, as antibodies have already been formed and the vaccines are made up of harmless components,"" Dr Lahariya said.Some 65% of India's adult population is fully vaccinated and around 91% have got at least one dose.The numbers in Bihar are lower: 36% of the adult population is fully vaccinated and 49% have received at least one dose.",Covaxin,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-59905339,BBC,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""omission"", ""reason"": ""The article does not mention the potential consequences of receiving multiple doses of the vaccine, such as increased risk of adverse effects or reduced efficacy.

55,India's lunar rover takes a walk on the Moon,"India's Moon rover has taken first ""steps"" on the lunar surface a day after the country made history becoming the first to land near the south pole.Chandrayaan-3's rover ""ramped down"" from the lander and ""India took a walk on the Moon!"", the space agency said.The Vikram lander successfully touched down as planned on Wednesday evening.With this, India joins an elite club of countries to achieve a soft landing on the Moon, after the US, the former Soviet Union and China.The 26kg rover called Pragyaan (the Sanskrit word for wisdom) was carried to the Moon in the Vikram lander's belly.After the dust raised by last evening's landing had settled, panels on one side of Vikram opened to deploy a ramp to enable Pragyaan to slide down to the lunar surface.It will now roam around the rocks and craters, gathering crucial data and images to be sent back to Earth for analysis.Pragyaan is carrying two scientific instruments which will try to find out what minerals are present on the lunar surface and study the chemical composition of the soil.Pragyaan will communicate only with the lander which will send the information to the orbiter from Chandrayaan-2 - which is still circling the Moon - to pass it on to the Earth for analysis.The Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) has said that the rover will move at a speed of 1cm per second. It will also leave on the Moon's surface the imprint of Isro's logo and emblem embossed on its six wheels.The landing coincides with the start of a lunar day - a day on the Moon equals a little over four weeks on Earth and this will mean the lander and rover will have 14 days of sunlight to charge their batteries.Once night falls, they will discharge and stop working. It is not yet clear whether they will come back to life when the next lunar day starts.The lander is also carrying several scientific instruments which will help find out what goes on the Moon's surface and above and below it.Moon is thought to hold important minerals but one of the major goals of Chandrayaan-3 is to hunt for water - scientists say the huge craters in the south pole region which are permanently in shadow hold ice which could support human habitation on the Moon in future.It could also be used for supplying propellant for spacecraft headed to Mars and other distant destinations.On Wednesday, tense moments preceded the touchdown as the lander began its precarious descent. The lander's speed was gradually reduced from 1.68km per second to almost zero, enabling it to make a soft landing on the lunar surface.The historic moment was greeted with celebrations across the country, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi saying ""India is now on the Moon"" and that ""we have reached where no other country could"".The landing came just days after Russia's Luna-25 spacecraft spun out of control and crashed into the Moon.The crash also put the spotlight on the difficult terrain of the south pole region where the surface is ""very uneven"" and ""full of craters and boulders"".India's second lunar mission, which also attempted to soft-land there in 2019, was unsuccessful - its lander and rover were destroyed, though its orbiter survived. Its continues to circle the Moon even today and is helping the Vikram lander send images and data to Earth for analysis.India is not the only country with an eye on the Moon - there's a growing global interest in it, with many other missions headed to the lunar surface in the near future.

56,"India mission enters Moon orbit, aiming for south pole","Chandrayaan-3, India's latest Moon mission, has entered the lunar orbit, the country's space agency has said.The spacecraft with an orbiter, lander and a rover lifted off on 14 July. It will try to set the lander and rover on the lunar surface on 23 or 24 August.If successful, India will be the first country to land near the Moon's little-explored south pole.It will be only the fourth to achieve a soft landing on the Moon, after the US, the former Soviet Union and China.After the spacecraft orbited the Earth for more than a week, it was sent into the translunar orbit on Tuesday through a slingshot manoeuvre.The third in India's programme of lunar exploration, Chandrayaan-3 is expected to build on the success of its earlier Moon missions.It comes 15 years after the country's first Moon mission in 2008, which discovered the presence of water molecules on the parched lunar surface and established that the Moon has an atmosphere during daytime.Chandrayaan-2 - which also comprised an orbiter, a lander and a rover - was launched in July 2019 but it was only partially successful. Its orbiter continues to circle and study the Moon even today, but the lander-rover failed to make a soft landing and crashed during touchdown.Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) chief Sreedhara Panicker Somanath has said they have carefully studied the data from its crash and carried out simulation exercises to fix the glitches in Chandrayaan-3, which weighs 3,900kg and cost 6.1bn rupees ($75m; £58m).The lander (called Vikram, after the founder of Isro) weighs about 1,500kg and carries within its belly the 26kg rover which is named Pragyaan, the Sanskrit word for wisdom.On Tuesday, Isro tweeted that the spacecraft had completed its orbits around the Earth and was headed towards the Moon.""A successful perigee-firing performed at Isro has injected the spacecraft into the translunar orbit. Next stop: the Moon,"" it said. A perigee is the point in the orbit closest to the Earth.Now that the craft has entered the Moon's orbit, scientists will begin reducing the rocket's speed gradually to bring it to a point which will allow a soft landing for Vikram.Once it lands, the six-wheeled rover will eject and roam around the rocks and craters on Moon's surface, gathering crucial data and images to be sent back to Earth for analysis.""The rover is carrying five instruments which will focus on finding out about the physical characteristics of the surface of the Moon, the atmosphere close to the surface and the tectonic activity to study what goes on below the surface.

57,India's lunar lander sends close-up photos of Moon,"India's space agency has released latest images of the Moon as its third lunar mission starts descending towards the little-explored south pole.The pictures have been taken by Vikram, Chandrayaan-3's lander, which began the last phase of its mission on Thursday.Vikram, which carries a rover in its belly, is due to land near the south pole on 23 August.The lander detached from the propulsion module, which carried it close to the Moon, on Thursday.The black-and-white images show close-ups of rocks and craters on the Moon's surface. One of the photographs shows the propulsion module too.Chandrayaan-3 and Russia's Luna-25 are among the two spacecraft headed towards the Moon's south pole and both are expected to land next week.Luna-25 - Russia's first Moon mission since 1976, when it was part of the Soviet Union - was launched last week and is expected to make history by making a soft landing on 21st or 22nd August, just days before the Indian touchdown. If it succeeds, Chandrayaan-3 will have to settle for being a close second in reaching the south pole.India, however, will still be only the fourth country to achieve a soft landing on the Moon after the US, the former Soviet Union and China.Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) said on Friday that the lander module had begun its descent to a lower orbit.Chandrayaan-3, the third in India's programme of lunar exploration, is expected to build on the success of its earlier Moon missions.It comes 15 years after the country's first Moon mission in 2008, which discovered the presence of water molecules on the parched lunar surface and established that the Moon has an atmosphere during daytime.Chandrayaan-2 - which also comprised an orbiter, a lander and a rover - was launched in July 2019 but it was only partially successful.

60,India announces plans for third Moon mission,"India has announced plans for a third lunar mission, months after its last one crash landed on the Moon's surface.The chairman of India's space agency, K Sivan, said work was going ""smoothly"" on the Chandrayaan-3 unmanned mission.He said the country was aiming to launch the mission in 2020 but that it ""may spill over"" to 2021.If successful, it would make India the fourth country to achieve a soft landing on the Moon, and boost its credentials as a low-cost space power.So far, only Russia, the US and China have successfully put a mission on the Moon's surface.Mr Sivan, chairman of the Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro), told reporters that Chandrayaan-3 would have a ""similar configuration"" to the previous mission.Chandrayaan-2 was the most complex mission ever attempted by India's space agency. It had aimed to land on the south pole of the Moon - in a spot that no other landing craft had reached before - to carry out tasks including searching for water and minerals, and measuring moonquakes.But the high-profile Moon mission failed in September, when the module crash landed.Mr Sivan said the new mission would land in the same area, and would ""have a lander, rover and propulsion module like its predecessor"".  The new equipment is set to cost some $35m (£26m), while the full cost of the mission is set to be significantly more.Jitendra Singh, junior minister for the department of space, has said the new mission will be ""quite economical"".""The orbiter is already there. So we are going to be cutting cost,"" he told the Times of India.Plans for an unmanned mission to the Moon are just part of India's wider ambitions of becoming a low-cost space power.Mr Sivan said India planned to launch at least 25 space missions in 2020.He said Isro was also making ""good progress"" with plans for its first manned mission into orbit.

61,The race to unravel the mysteries of Moon's south pole,"The sun lingers slightly above or just below the horizon, while towering mountains project dark shadows.Deep craters provide a haven for unending darkness. Some of these areas have been shielded from sunlight for billions of years. In these regions, temperatures plummet to astonishing lows of -414F (-248C) - because the Moon has no atmosphere to warm up the surface. No human has set foot in this completely unexplored world.The Moon's south pole, according to Nasa, is full of ""mystery, science and intrigue"".No wonder then that there's a so-called space race to reach the south pole of the Moon, far away from the Apollo landing sites clustered around the equator.On Wednesday, India landed a robotic probe - Chandrayaan-3 - near the south pole. Three days earlier, Russia's Luna-25 crashed into the Moon while attempting the same feat.India is also planning a joint Lunar Polar Exploration (Lupex) mission with Japan to explore the shadowed regions or the ""dark side of the Moon"" by 2026.Why is the south pole emerging as a compelling scientific destination? Scientists say a key reason is water.Data gathered by the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, a Nasa spacecraft that has been orbiting the Moon for 14 years, suggests water ice is present in some of the large, permanently shadowed craters that could potentially sustain humanity.Water exists as a solid or vapour on the Moon because of the vacuum - the Moon doesn't have enough gravity to hold an atmosphere. India's Chandrayaan-1 lunar mission was the first to find evidence of water on the Moon in 2008.""It is yet to be proven that the water ice is accessible or mineable. In other words, are there reserves of water that can be extracted economically?"" Clive Neal, a professor of planetary geology at the US University of Notre Dame, told me.The prospect of finding water on the Moon is exciting in many ways, scientists say.The frozen water untainted by the Sun's radiation might have accumulated in cold polar regions over millions of years, leading to the accumulation of ice on or near the surface. This provides a unique sample for scientists to analyse and understand the history of water in our solar system.""We can address questions such as where did the water come from and when, and what are the implications for the evolution on life on Earth,"" says Simeon Barber, a planetary scientist at UK's The Open University, who also works with the European Space Agency.There are other ""pragmatic"" reasons for accessing water on or just below the Moon's surface, says Prof Barber.Many countries are planning new human missions to the Moon, and the astronauts will need water for drinking and sanitation.Transporting equipment from Earth to the Moon involves overcoming the Earth's gravitational pull. The larger the equipment, the more rocket and fuel load would be needed to achieve a successful landing on the Moon. The new commercial space companies charge around $1m to take a kilogram of payload to the Moon.""That's $1m per litre of drinking water! Space entrepreneurs no doubt see lunar ice as an opportunity to supply astronauts with locally sourced water,"" says Prof Barber.That's not all. Water molecules can be broken apart into hydrogen and oxygen atoms, and both can be used as propellants to fire rockets. But first scientists need to know how much ice is there on the Moon, in what forms, and whether it can be extracted efficiently and purified to make it safe to drink.Also, some extremes at the south pole are bathed in sunlight for extended periods of time, up to 200 Earth days of constant illumination. ""Solar power is another resource [to set up a lunar base and power equipment] potential that the pole has,"" says Noah Petro, a project scientist at Nasa.The lunar south pole also sits on the rim of a massive impact crater of the solar system. Spanning a diameter of 2,500km (1,600 miles) and reaching depths of up to 8km, this crater is one of the most ancient features within the solar system. ""By landing on the pole you can begin to understand what is going on with this large crater,"" says Dr Petro.Navigating the lunar pole with rovers, space suits and sampling tools in a distinctly different light and thermal environment in contrast to previously explored equatorial sites also promises to yield valuable insights.But scientists are chary of calling this a race to the south pole.""These missions have been planned for decades and got delayed so many times. Race is not critical to our understanding of the Moon. The last time there was a real space race, we ended up losing interest in the Moon after three years and haven't returned to its surface in 50 years,"" says Vishnu Reddy, a professor of planetary sciences at the University of Arizona.The Indian and Russian missions also had some common objectives, scientists point out.Both aimed to land with similarly sized spacecraft in the south polar region, further south of the equator than any previous lunar mission.Following an unsuccessful landing attempt in 2019, India wanted to showcase its capability for precise lunar touchdown near the pole. It also aims to examine the Moon's exosphere - an extremely sparse atmosphere - and analysing the polar regolith, an accumulation of loose particles and dust amassed over billions of years that rest above a bedrock.Luna-25's objectives included the analysis of the polar regolith's composition, as well as an examination of plasma and dust elements of the lunar pole exosphere.To be sure, the landing site of the Indian orbiter is a ""bit away from the actual pole"". ""But the data [it provides] will be fascinating,"" says Prof Neal.Russia and China have plans to build a lunar space station to develop research facilities on the surface of the Moon, in orbit or both. Russia is planning more Luna missions. Nasa is sending instruments on commercial landers to go to places across the Moon. Japan is preparing to send a smart lander (the SLIM mission) on 26 August - a small-scale mission to demonstrate accurate lunar landing techniques by a small explorer.And, of course, Nasa's Artemis programme aims to put astronauts back on the Moon in a series of spaceflights, more than half a century after the last Apollo mission.""The Moon is like a giant puzzle.

62,The moment India's rover stepped out for Moonwalk,"India's space agency has released new footage that shows Chandrayaan-3's rover for the first time ever.The video was taken just hours after the country made history by becoming the first to land near the south pole.It shows Pragyaan (Sanskrit for wisdom) exiting the lander by sliding down a ramp and taking first ""steps"" on the lunar surface.The Vikram lander - carrying the rover in its belly - had successfully touched down as planned on Wednesday evening.With this, India joins an elite club of countries to achieve a soft landing on the Moon, after the US, the former Soviet Union and China.On Thursday, the Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) said the 26kg rover had ""ramped down"" from the lander and ""India took a walk on the Moon!"".Friday morning's video showed the rover as it stepped out into the sunshine and its lengthening shadow.Pragyaan - which moves at a speed of 1cm per second - is now roaming around the rocks and craters, gathering crucial data and images to be sent back to Earth for analysis. It's also leaving on the Moon's surface the imprint of Isro's logo and emblem embossed on its six wheels.The rover is carrying two scientific instruments which will try to find out what minerals are present on the lunar surface and study the chemical composition of the soil.Pragyaan will communicate only with the lander which will send the information to the orbiter from Chandrayaan-2 - which is still circling the Moon - to pass it on to the Earth for analysis.The landing on Wednesday coincided with the start of a lunar day - a day on the Moon equals a little over four weeks on Earth and this means the lander and rover will have 14 days of sunlight to charge their batteries.Once night falls, they will discharge and stop working. It is not yet clear whether they will come back to life when the next lunar day starts.The lander is also carrying several scientific instruments which will help find out what goes on the Moon's surface and above and below it.Moon is thought to hold important minerals but one of the major goals of Chandrayaan-3 is to hunt for water - scientists say the huge craters in the south pole region which are permanently in shadow hold ice which could support human habitation on the Moon in future.It could also be used for supplying propellant for spacecraft headed to Mars and other distant destinations.The landing came just days after Russia's Luna-25 spacecraft spun out of control and crashed into the Moon.BBC News India is now on YouTube.

63,Indian space chief says no mystery over rocket debris,"India's space chief says a giant metal dome that washed up on an Australian beach was definitely part of a rocket - but may or may not be Indian.""We can't confirm it's ours unless we analyse it,"" S Somanath told the BBC.There has been wild speculation about the object ever since it was discovered at Green Head beach, about 250km (155 miles) north of Perth, at the weekend.Some even said it may be from India's latest Moon mission launch last Friday but experts quickly ruled that out.The cylindrical object, about 2.5m wide and between 2.5m and 3m long, has generated a lot of excitement among the residents of Green Head beach.It was initially speculated that the wreckage could be a part of MH370 - a plane that went missing off the west Australian coast in 2014 with 239 passengers on board.But aviation experts soon clarified that the item couldn't have come from a commercial aircraft and that it was possibly a fuel tank from a rocket that had fallen into the Indian Ocean at some stage.The Australian Space Agency then said it was possible the giant cylinder could have fallen from a ""foreign space launch vehicle"".This resulted in speculation that the object was a fuel tank of a PSLV - the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicles that the Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) regularly uses to launch satellites into space.Since India had launched Chandrayaan-3 spacecraft to Moon last Friday, it led to speculation that the debris came from that - despite experts saying the object had been in the water for at least a few months. Photos showing its extensive barnacle cover support that argument.Mr Somanath, who heads Isro, told the BBC that there was ""no mystery"" about the object, confirming that ""it is part of some rocket"".""It could be a PSLV or any other and unless we see and analyse it, it cannot be confirmed,"" he said. The Australian authorities have yet to release more details.Mr Somanath, however, confirmed that ""some of the PSLV parts are known to have fallen in the sea beyond Australia's Exclusive Economic Zone"" and said that the object ""may have been floating for a long time and finally reached shore"".He added that there was no danger associated with the debris.Authorities in Australia, however, have said they were treating the item ""as hazardous"" and police have requested people to keep a safe distance.

64,Why it costs India so little to reach the Moon and Mars,"India recently announced a host of ambitious space projects and approved 227bn rupees ($2.7bn; £2.1bn) for them.The plans include the next phase of India’s historic mission to the Moon, sending an orbiter to Venus, building of the first phase of the country’s maiden space station and development of a new reusable heavy-lifting rocket to launch satellites.It's the single largest allocation of funds ever for space projects in India, but considering the scale and complexity of the projects, they are far from lavish and have once again brought into focus the cost-effectiveness of India’s space programme.Experts around the world have marvelled at how little Indian Space Research Organisation’s (Isro) Moon, Mars and solar missions have cost. India spent $74m on the Mars orbiter Mangalyaan and $75m on last year’s historic Chandrayaan-3 – less than the $100m spent on the sci-fi thriller Gravity.Nasa’s Maven orbiter had cost $582m and Russia’s Luna-25, which crashed on to the Moon’s surface two days before Chandrayaan-3’s landing, had cost 12.6bn roubles ($133m).Despite the low cost, scientists say India is punching much above its weight by aiming to do valuable work.Chandrayaan-1 was the first to confirm the presence of water in lunar soil and Mangalyaan carried a payload to study methane in the atmosphere of Mars. Images and data sent by Chandrayaan-3 are being looked at with great interest by space enthusiasts around the world.So how does India keep the costs so low?Retired civil servant Sisir Kumar Das, who looked after Isro’s finances for more than two decades, says the frugality can be traced back to the 1960s, when scientists first pitched a space programme to the government.India had gained independence from British colonial rule only in 1947 and the country was struggling to feed its population and build enough schools and hospitals.“Isro’s founder and scientist Vikram Sarabhai had to convince the government that a space programme was not just a sophisticated luxury that had no place in a poor country like India. He explained that satellites could help India serve its citizens better,” Mr Das told the BBC.But India’s space programme has always had to work with a tight budget in a country with conflicting needs and demands. Photographs from the 1960s and 70s show scientists carrying rockets and satellites on cycles or even a bullock cart.Decades later and after several successful interplanetary missions, Isro’s budget remains modest. This year, India’s budgetary allocation for its space programme is 130bn rupees ($1.55bn) - Nasa’s budget for the year is $25bn.Mr Das says one of the main reasons why Isro’s missions are so cheap is the fact that all its technology is home-grown and machines are manufactured in India.In 1974, after Delhi conducted its first nuclear test and the West imposed an embargo, banning transfer of technology to India, the restrictions were “turned into a blessing in disguise” for the space programme, he adds.“Our scientists used it as an incentive to develop their own technology. All the equipment they needed was manufactured indigenously - and the salaries and cost of labour were decidedly less here than in the US or Europe.”Science writer Pallava Bagla says that unlike Isro, Nasa outsources satellite manufacturing to private companies and also takes out insurance for its missions, which add to their costs.“Also, unlike Nasa, India doesn't do engineering models which are used for testing a project before the actual launch. We do only a single model and it's meant to fly. It's risky, there are chances of crash, but that's the risk we take. And we are able to take it because it’s a government programme.”Mylswamy Annadurai, chief of India’s first and second Moon missions and Mars mission, told the BBC that Isro employs far fewer people and pays lower salaries,  which makes Indian projects competitive.He says he “led small dedicated teams of less than 10 and people often worked extended hours without any overtime payments” because they were so passionate about what they did.The tight budget for the projects, he said, sometimes sent them back to the drawing board, allowed them to think out of the box and led to new innovations.“For Chandrayaan-1, the allocated budget was $89m and that was okay for the original configuration. But subsequently, it was decided that the spacecraft would carry a Moon impact probe which meant an additional 35kg.”Scientists had two choices - use a heavier rocket to carry the mission, but that would cost more, or remove some of the hardware to lighten the load.“We chose the second option. We reduced the number of thrusters from 16 to eight and pressure tanks and batteries were reduced from two to one.”Reducing the number of batteries, Mr Annadurai says, meant the launch had to take place before the end of 2008.“That would give the spacecraft two years while it went around the Moon without encountering a long solar eclipse, which would impact its ability to recharge. So we had to maintain a strict work schedule to meet the launch deadline.”Mangalyaan cost so little, Mr Annadurai says, “because we used most of the hardware we had already designed for Chandrayaan-2 after the second Moon mission got delayed”.Mr Bagla says India’s space programme coming at such low cost is “an amazing feat”. But as India scales up, the cost could rise.At the moment, he says, India uses small rocket launchers because they don't have anything stronger. But that means India's spacecraft take much longer to reach their destination.So, when Chandrayaan-3 was launched, it orbited the Earth several times before it was sling-shot into the lunar orbit, where it went around the Moon a few times before landing. On the other hand, Russia’s Luna-25 escaped the Earth’s gravity quickly riding a powerful Soyuz rocket.“We used Mother Earth's gravity to nudge us to the Moon. It took us weeks and a lot of resourceful planning. Isro has mastered this and done it successfully so many times.”But, Mr Bagla says, India has announced plans to send a manned mission to the Moon by 2040 and it would need a more powerful rocket to fly the astronauts there quicker.The government recently said work on this new rocket had already been approved and it would be ready by 2032. This Next Generation Launch Vehicle (NGLV) will be able to carry more weight but also cost more.Also, Mr Bagla says, India is in the process of opening up the space sector to private players and it’s unlikely that costs will remain so low once that happens.Follow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.",Chandrayaan-3,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn9xlgnnpzvo,BBC,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""framing"", ""reason"": ""The article frames India's space program as 'cost-effective' and 'punching above its weight', implying a positive evaluation of the program's efficiency."", ""confidence"": 0.8}",no,none,no framing
65,India's lunar lander Vikram inches closer to Moon,"India's third lunar mission is inching closer to the Moon's little-explored south pole where it aims to set down a lander and rover on 23 August.On Thursday, the lander detached from the propulsion module, which carried it close to the Moon, beginning the last phase of its mission.Chandrayaan-3, however, may not be the first to land near the south pole if it's beaten by a new Russian mission.Luna-25, launched last week, is expected to land a day or two earlier.If the Russian spacecraft - the country's first Moon mission since 1976 comes in nearly half a century when Russia was part of the Soviet Union - is successful in making a soft landing on 21st or 22nd August as planned, Chandrayaan-3 will have to settle for being a close second.India, however, will still be only the fourth country to achieve a soft landing on the Moon after the US, the former Soviet Union and China.Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) said that on Friday, the lander module would begin its descent to a lower orbit. Called Vikram - after Isro founder Vikram Sarabhai - the lander carries within its belly a rover named Pragyaan, the Sanskrit word for wisdom.Chief of India's first Moon mission Mylswamy Annadurai told the BBC that after Thursday's separation from the propulsion module, the lander will do two manoeuvres over the next few days, getting closer to the Moon with each one, and will reach an orbit of 30km by 100km a day before it lands.Once it lands, he says, it will take a few hours for the dust to settle after which the six-wheeled rover will crawl out and roam around the rocks and craters on the Moon's surface, gathering crucial data and images to be sent back to Earth for analysis.With the Indian and Russian missions aiming to land within days of each other, some space watchers are describing it as a ""mini space race"".Russia launched Luna-25 on 10 August, but propelled by the much more powerful Soyuz rocket, it escaped the Earth's gravity in no time and reached lunar orbit on Wednesday, the Russian space agency Roscosmos announced.Chandrayaan-3 was launched on 14 July, but it went around the Earth a few times before entering the lunar orbit on 5 August. The spacecraft has been orbiting the Moon since then, while preparing for the landing.Isro, however, told the BBC it's not a race and the two nations will have a new 'meeting point' on the Moon.""Isro has never been in any race right from the day one of its inception in 1960s,"" an Isro spokesman told me.""We planned the mission based on the readiness of the spacecraft and the available technical window to reach the far side of the Moon. Luna-25 is also a mission planned long time ago. They also must  have some technical considerations, which we don't know precisely,"" he said.Chandrayaan-3, the third in India's programme of lunar exploration, is expected to build on the success of its earlier Moon missions.It comes 15 years after the country's first Moon mission in 2008, which discovered the presence of water molecules on the parched lunar surface and established that the Moon has an atmosphere during daytime.Chandrayaan-2 - which also comprised an orbiter, a lander and a rover - was launched in July 2019 but it was only partially successful. Its orbiter continues to circle and study the Moon even today, but the lander-rover failed to make a soft landing and crashed during touchdown.Isro chief Sreedhara Panicker Somanath has said India's space agency had carefully studied the data from its crash and carried out simulation exercises to fix the glitches in Chandrayaan-3, which weighs 3,900kg and cost 6.1bn rupees ($75m; £58m). The lander module weighs about 1,500kg, including the 26kg-rover Pragyaan.Once the craft entered the Moon's orbit on 5 August, scientists gradually began reduced the rocket's speed to bring it to a point which will allow a soft landing for Vikram.The rover is carrying instruments which will focus on finding out about the physical characteristics of the surface of the Moon, the atmosphere close to the surface and the tectonic activity to study what goes on below the surface.The south pole of the Moon is still largely unexplored - the surface area that remains in shadow there is much larger than that of the Moon's north pole, and scientists say it means there is a possibility of water in areas that are permanently shadowed.One of the major goals of both Chandrayaan-3 and Luna-25 is to hunt for water ice which, scientists say, could support human habitation on the Moon in future. It could also be used for supplying propellant for spacecraft headed to Mars and other distant destinations.BBC News India is now on YouTube.

66,India aims to be first to land near Moon's south pole,"India is hoping to make history on Wednesday by becoming the first nation to land near the Moon's south pole.One of the mission's major goals is to hunt for water-based ice, which scientists say could support human habitation on the Moon in future.If Chandrayaan-3 is successful, India will be only the fourth country to have achieved a soft landing on the Moon.India's attempt comes just days after Russia's Luna-25 crashed while trying to touch down in the same region.The south pole of the Moon holds special promise in the search for water ice. The surface area that remains in permanent shadow there is huge, and scientists say it means there is a possibility of water in these areas.The US, the former Soviet Union and China have all achieved a soft landing near the Moon's equator - but none have led successful missions to its south pole.India's attempt to land its Chandrayaan-2 mission near the south pole in 2019 was unsuccessful - it crashed into the lunar surface.So all eyes are now on Chandrayaan-3 - its third mission to the little-explored Moon.The spacecraft with an orbiter, lander and a rover lifted off on 14 July from the Sriharikota space centre in south India.The lander - called Vikram after Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) founder Vikram Sarabhai - carries within its belly the 26kg rover named Pragyaan, the Sanskrit word for wisdom.Once the descent starts, the lander's speed will be gradually reduced from 1.68km per second at its present height to almost zero by the time it reaches 800m, Isro's Nilesh M Desai told ANI news agency.A call will then be made about its landing location once Vikram has travelled down to a height of 150m. If the area is found unsuitable, the lander will move a little to the left or the right to find a more suitable landing spot. If all fails, the emergency mode will kick in which will help with a safe landing, Mr Desai said.Once it lands and the dust settles, the six-wheeled rover will crawl out of its belly and roam around the rocks and craters on the Moon's surface, gathering crucial data and images to be sent to the lander, which will pass it on to the orbiter to send to Earth.The rover's wheels have the Isro's logo and emblem embossed on them so that they leave imprints on the lunar soil during the Moon walk, an official told the BBC.Chandrayaan-3's journey to the Moon has generated a lot of excitement in India, with wishes for the mission's success pouring in from across the country.Isro has announced plans for a live telecast of the landing and millions of people, including schoolchildren, are expected to tune in.On Tuesday, Isro chief Sreedhara Panicker Somanath told the Hindustan Times he was ""extremely confident of a successful landing"" because they had made ""back-ups of the back-up plans"".He said they had carefully studied the data from the Chandrayaan-2 crash and carried out simulation exercises to fix the glitches.In the past few days, the Vikram lander's camera has been extensively mapping the lunar surface while attempting to locate a safe landing spot.In its update on Tuesday, Isro said the mission ""is on schedule, systems are undergoing regular checks and smooth sailing is continuing"".Mr Somanath has said Chandrayaan-3 will work to build on the success of India's earlier Moon missions and help make some ""very substantial"" scientific discovery.Chandrayaan-1, the country's first Moon mission in 2008, discovered the presence of water molecules on the parched lunar surface and established that the Moon has an atmosphere during daytime.And despite failing the soft landing, Chandrayaan-2 was not a complete write-off - its orbiter continues to circle the Moon even today and will help the Vikram lander send images and data to Earth for analysis.The lander and the rover are carrying five scientific instruments which will help discover ""the physical characteristics of the surface of the Moon, the atmosphere close to the surface and the tectonic activity to study what goes on below the surface"".The landing date has been carefully selected to coincide with the start of a lunar day.A day on the Moon equals a little over four week on Earth and this will mean the lander and rover will have 14 days of sunlight to charge their batteries. Once night falls, they will discharge and stop working.It is not yet clear whether they will come back to life when the next lunar day starts.India is not the only country with an eye on the Moon - there's a growing global interest in it, with many other missions headed to the lunar surface in the near future. And scientists say there is still much to understand about the Moon, which is often described as a gateway to deep space.A successful Chandrayaan-3, they say, will take us a step closer in that quest.How are you planning to watch the space mission?

69,India's Moon lander searches for safe landing spot,"India's space agency has released images of the far side of the Moon as its third lunar mission attempts to locate a safe landing spot near the little-explored south pole.The pictures have been taken by Vikram, Chandrayaan-3's lander, which began the last phase of its mission on Thursday.Vikram, which carries a rover in its belly, is due to land on 23 August.The photos come a day after Russia's Luna-25 spacecraft crashed into the Moon after spinning out of control.The craft - Russia's first Moon mission in nearly 50 years - was due to be the first ever to land on the south pole, but failed after encountering problems as it moved into its pre-landing orbit.On Monday morning, the Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) said the lander from Chandrayaan-3, which is due to touch down on Wednesday at 18:04 India time (12:34 GMT), has been mapping the landing area and taking images with its ""hazard detection and avoidance"" camera.Isro added that the black-and-white images sent by this camera will assist them ""in locating a safe landing area - without boulders or deep trenches"".The lunar far side is the side that faces away from the Earth and is sometimes also called ""the dark side of the Moon"" because so little is known about it. Scientists say landing there can be a tricky affair.But there's a lot of interest in this part of the Moon which scientists think could hold frozen water and precious elements.Isro said on Sunday that the lander module had been successfully lowered into an orbit closer to the Moon (of 25km by 134km) and is now waiting for the lunar Sun-rise to land.If Chandrayaan-3 is successful, India will be first to land near the lunar south pole.

I salute their spirit and ingenuity!"" he wrote on Twitter.The third in India's programme of lunar exploration, Chandrayaan-3 is expected to build on the success of its earlier Moon missions.It comes 15 years after the country's first Moon mission in 2008, which carried out ""the first and most detailed search for water on the lunar surface and established the Moon has an atmosphere during daytime"", said Mylswamy Annadurai, project director of Chandrayaan-1.Chandrayaan-2 - which also comprised an orbiter, a lander and a rover - was launched in July 2019 but it was only partially successful. Its orbiter continues to circle and study the Moon even today, but the lander-rover failed to make a soft landing and crashed during touchdown. It was because of ""a last-minute glitch in the braking system"", explained Mr Annadurai.Mr Somanath has said they have carefully studied the data from the last crash and carried out simulation exercises to fix the glitches.Chandrayaan-3, which weighs 3,900kg and cost 6.1bn rupees ($75m; £58m), has the ""same goals"" as its predecessor - to ensure a soft-landing on the Moon's surface, he added.The lander (called Vikram, after the founder of Isro) weighs about 1,500kg and carries within its belly the 26kg rover which is named Pragyaan, the Sanskrit word for wisdom.After Friday's lift-off, the craft will take about 15 to 20 days to enter the Moon's orbit. Scientists will then start reducing the rocket's speed over the next few weeks to bring it to a point which will allow a soft landing for Vikram.If all goes to plan, the six-wheeled rover will then eject and roam around the rocks and craters on Moon's surface, gathering crucial data and images to be sent back to Earth for analysis.""The rover is carrying five instruments which will focus on finding out about the physical characteristics of the surface of the Moon, the atmosphere close to the surface and the tectonic activity to study what goes on below the surface. I'm hoping we'll find something new,"" Mr Somanath told Mirror Now.The south pole of the Moon is still largely unexplored - the surface area that remains in shadow there is much larger than that of the Moon's north pole, which means there is a possibility of water in areas that are permanently shadowed. Chandrayaan-1 was the first to discover water on the Moon in 2008, near the south pole.""We have more scientific interest in this spot because the equatorial region, which is safe for landing, has already been reached and a lot of data is available for that,"" Mr Somanath said.""If we want to make a significant scientific discovery, we have to go to a new area such as the south pole, but it has higher risks of landing.""Mr Somanath adds data from Chandrayaan-2 crash has been ""collected and analysed"" and it has helped fix all the errors in the latest mission.""The orbiter from Chandrayaan-2 has been providing lots of very high-resolution images of the spot where we want to land and that data has been well studied so we know how many boulders and craters are there and we have widened the domain of landing for a better possibility.""The landing, Mr Annadurai said, would have to be ""absolutely precise"" to coincide with the start of a lunar day (a day on the Moon equals 29.53 days on Earth) which will allow about 14 days of sunlight  for the batteries of the lander and the rover to charge and function.The Moon mission, Mr Annadurai says, was thought up in the early 2000s as an exciting project to attract talent at a time of the IT boom in India, as most technology graduates wanted to join the software industry.""The success of Chandrayaan-1 helped on that count. The space programme became a matter of pride for India and it's now considered very prestigious to work for Isro.""But the larger goal of India's space programme, Mr Annadurai says, ""encompasses science and technology and the future of humanity"".India is not the only country with an eye on the Moon - there's a growing global interest in it. And scientists say there is still much to understand about the Moon that's often described as a gateway to deep space.""If we want to develop the Moon as an outpost, a gateway to deep space, then we need to carry out many more explorations to see what sort of habitat would we be able to build there with the locally-available material and how will we carry supplies to our people there,"" Mr Annadurai says.""So the ultimate goal for India's probes is that one day when the Moon - separated by 360,000km of space - will become an extended continent of Earth, we will not be a passive spectator, but have an active, protected life in that continent and we need to continue to work towards that.""And a successful Chandrayaan-3 will be a significant step in that direction.Sign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.",Chandrayaan-3,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-66185565,BBC,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""tonality"", ""reason"": ""The article's tone is overwhelmingly positive and celebratory, using words like 'majestic', 'soaring in the sky', and 'scripted a new chapter' to describe the mission."", ""confidence"": 0.8}",no,none,no tonality bias
71,The mysteries of the Moon's South Pole,"India's Chandrayaan-3 mission is already revealing new insights about the Moon's enigmatic South Pole. Future missions to this region are planned by the US, China and Russia, so what makes it so fascinating?It's a place where no human-made object has trundled before. Last week, however, the diminutive Pragyaan rover slid down a ramp from its mothership, India's Vikram lander, and began exploring the region around the Moon's South Pole.The uncrewed spacecraft is something of a pioneer – the first to make a soft-landing in the frigid, crater-strewn lunar polar landscape. Whereas the Apollo missions of the 1960s and 70s primarily set down near the Moon's equator, the lander from India's Chandrayaan-3 mission successfully touched down about 370 miles (600km) from the lunar south pole, closer than any spacecraft has been to this location.It arrived hot on the heels of a failed Russian attempt two days earlier, the Luna-25 spacecraft, which span out of control and crashed. India's mission is the start of a rush of activity at this enigmatic part of the lunar surface that will ultimately see humans set foot there later this decade.""It's just incredible that this is happening,"" says Simeon Barber, a planetary scientist at The Open University in the UK.Alongside India and Russia, both the US and China have their sights set on the Moon's South Pole. There they hope to investigate some of the Moon's most intriguing mysteries and perhaps even exploit what they find.But what is it about the Moon's South Pole that has made it so attractive to these visitors?Already Chandrayaan-3 and its suitcase-sized rover have sent back a few tantalising hints of the strange environment they find themselves in. Travelling at around 1cm (0.4 inches) every second across the dusty surface, the Pragyaan rover has edged itself several metres away from its mothership.Burrowing its sensors into the lunar soil along the way, the rover has revealed a curiously sharp drop in temperature beneath the surface. At the surface it measured a temperature of around 50C (120F), but just 80mm (3 inches) below this, it fell to -10C (14F) – a temperature difference that has ""surprised"" scientists.Onboard chemical analysis equipment has also indicated the presence of sulphur, aluminium, calcium iron, titanium, manganese, chromium and oxygen in the lunar soil.Both of these early findings hint at why scientists are eager to explore the south polar region of the Moon.The Moon's shallow axis of rotation, 1.5 degrees compared to Earth's 23.5 degrees, means some craters at its poles never see sunlight. Coupled with low temperatures in these locations, scientists believe this has resulted in an abundance of ice, much of it made of water, that is either mixed into the soil or exposed on the surface. There are hopes that the ice could be used as both a resource for astronauts and a springboard for future scientific discoveries. ""It is a unique location,"" says Saumitra Mukherjee, a professor of geology at Jawaharlal Nehru University in New Delhi, India. ""The availability of water is very important.""Our best evidence for water ice on the moon comes from a Nasa experiment in October 2009 when an empty rocket was purposefully slammed into a crater at the South Pole. ""The plume of material had evidence of water,"" says Margaret Landis, a planetary scientist at the University of Colorado, Boulder, in the US. ""That is our one direct observation of water ice on the Moon.""Other data points to a higher reflectance at the poles, a likely result of ice, while a higher amount of hydrogen at the poles has been observed, perhaps a result of water ice. Last year scientist William Reach at Nasa's Ames Research Center in California flew Nasa's now-retired Sofia telescope in a plane to study the Moon, finding evidence of hydrogen ""just outside"" the landing site now occupied by Chandrayaan-3's Vikram and its rover since they touched down on 23 August.These recent discoveries of water ice have spurred a renewed interest in exploring the Moon, and in particular, its South Pole.India's lander and rover will now allow scientists to ""test theories that lunar researchers have been proposing about water ice presence in the lunar soil,"" says Aanchal Sharma, a former engineer at the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), now working at the University of Trento, Italy.While Chandrayaan-3's data will be useful, it is later missions that will land closer to the South Pole that scientists are particularly excited about. Here, there are craters known as permanently shadowed regions (PSRs). Sometimes dubbed ""craters of eternal darkness"", these are angled in such a way that the Sun's rays never reach their innards, meaning they have potentially stored ice for billions of years. The South Pole has more craters than the North Pole, likely a random outcome of how many meteorite impacts have hit the surface, making the South Pole a more attractive target.Temperatures in PSRs might drop below -200C (-390F), making them prime locations to look for ice. A Nasa rover set to head to the Moon's South Pole in late 2024, called Viper, will drive into some of these PSRs, switching on headlights to shed light – literally – on their secrets. The mission should tell us if there are ""blocky chunks of ice"" or ""little crystals mixed into a sandy mix,"" says Dan Andrews at Nasa's Ames Research Center, Viper's project manager.Viper might not be the first mission to enter a PSR, however. A preceding mission called the Micro-Nova hopper, from the US firm Intuitive Machines, may be sent to the Moon earlier in 2024. While it lacks the instrumentation of Viper, such as a drill to dig into the surface, it will use its thrusters to ""jump"" into a PSR at the Moon's South Pole, giving us our first ever glimpse inside.These are not the only missions targeting the Moon's South Pole though. A follow-up Indian mission in partnership with Japan, Chandrayaan-4, will also head here, while China has signaled its intent to land in this region and Russia has another planned South Pole mission.Water ice is driving that interest. If it does exist in abundance and is accessible, it could be a valuable resource both for human settlements on the Moon and exploration farther into the solar system. If the ice can be stripped from the lunar soil it could be split into hydrogen and oxygen, a key component of rocket fuel or a potential source of drinking water and oxygen for human settlements.""The simplest way to mine it is to dig up the icy soil and put it in some kind of oven to sublimate the ice,"" says Kevin Cannon, an assistant professor in geology at the Colorado School of Mines in the US. ""We could put enough propellant into a depot for a rocket to refuel and reach the outer solar system many times over. There's also access to spots that are illuminated for up to 90% of the year, which gives good solar power for processing the soil into oxygen and metals like aluminium.""These dreams of deep space travel and living on the moon are closer than one might think. In 2025 Nasa plans to land humans on the surface of the Moon on a SpaceX lander for the first time in half a century as part of its Artemis III mission. They will land at a currently unselected site at the South Pole and directly prospect for ice for the first time.""The main objectives for that mission are learning how to land and operate in the polar regions,"" says Jacob Bleacher, Nasa's chief exploration scientist. Depending on the nature of ice discovered by previous missions like Viper at the South Pole, the astronauts will likely carry tools to collect some and return it to Earth. Future Artemis missions may then look to utilise this more keenly as a resource. ""It is an iterative set of steps,"" says Bleacher.The prospect of other potentially useable minerals and metals on the Moon's surface could also be mined and used by astronauts to construct the infrastructure they will need to survive there.There are many scientific reasons to explore the Moon's South Pole, too. Scientists are eager to solve the origin of the Moon's water, which may have been erupted by ancient lunar volcanoes billions of years ago, delivered by asteroids or comets, or even carried on the solar wind. ""What's really exciting about water on the Moon is really understanding how rocky planets get their water, which is a key part of their habitability,"" says Landis. ""Understanding how the Moon got its water can tell us more about Earth and also rocky exoplanets [in other solar systems].""Additionally, China's Chang'e-4 rover has found evidence for a vast crater buried close to the South Pole of the Moon resulting from a violent impact early in its life, which scientists are eager to learn more about. ""We can see a cross-section of the buried crater"" using radar, says Jianqing Feng at the Planetary Science Institute in Arizona.Brett Denevi, a planetary scientist at Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Maryland, US, who was selected to lead a geology team to set scientific goals for the Artemis III astronauts earlier this month, also notes that terrain at the south pole is some of the oldest on the Moon, with less evidence of recent volcanism. ""That provides a fantastic opportunity to look at some of the really early solar system processes that aren't recorded on Earth,"" she says. Denevi's team is keen to solve other mysteries about the Moon, such as why its far side has many more craters than the near side and the nature of a magma ocean that likely once covered its surface. ""We still have these really fundamental questions about the Moon,"" she says.Chandrayaan-3 may be just the start in answering these questions, and perhaps even living and working on the Moon like never before. ""We're going to the moon to learn how to survive in the solar system and build a blueprint for exploring space,"" says Bleacher. ""And we'll be able to learn about the history of the solar system.""This really is a next big step for humankind.""--Join one million Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter or Instagram.If you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called ""The Essential List"" – a handpicked selection of stories from BBC Future, Culture, Worklife, Travel and Reel delivered to your inbox every Friday.",Chandrayaan-3,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20230830-the-mysteries-of-the-moons-south-pole,BBC,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""tonality"", ""reason"": ""The article's tone is generally neutral and informative, but it occasionally uses phrases that convey a sense of excitement and wonder, such as 'It's just incredible that this is happening' or 'This really is a next big "", ""confidence"": 0.8}",no,none,no tonality bias
72,Will Russia beat India to the Moon?,"Two spacecraft – one built by India and the other by Russia – are hurtling on missions towards our Moon by very different routes. But does it matter which touches down first?Right now, a mini space race is afoot. Two spacecraft, one Russian and the other Indian, are headed for the South Pole of the Moon – where no lander has ever successfully gone before. The Russian and Indian vehicles are on competing quests to search for water ice and potentially useful minerals that might be tucked away in the lunar dust.Such was the timing of the crafts' departures that they are due to reach their destinations around the same date. No one planned this showdown, it is simply a curious twist of fate – but one that has got the world watching, and wondering: who will get there first?The timing of Luna-25's arrival seems to have worried the Indian Space Research Organisation, who two days before Russia's planned launch issued a public statement assessing the increasingly cramped orbital space around the Moon. It warned that there are already six active spacecraft orbiting the Moon – four belong to Nasa, one is from South Korea and another from an earlier Indian mission – but added that with the arrival of Luna-25 followed by nine further spacecraft over the next two years there will be a growing risk of collisions. It said that its own Chandrayaan-2 spacecraft, which launched three years ago, has already had to perform three collision avoidance manoeuvres to prevent close encounters with Nasa's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter and the Korea Pathfinder Lunar Orbiter.For decades, our reading of things that happen in space has been unavoidably shaped by the original space race of the 1960s, in which the United States and the Soviet Union vied to put a human being on the Moon. Despite the Soviet Union becoming the first nation to put a satellite in Earth orbit, launch a human into space, and land an uncrewed spacecraft on the Moon, the US grabbed the biggest prize of all when the Apollo 11 mission carried astronauts to the lunar surface. Their adventure was broadcast on TV screens around the world and it was followed by further crewed Apollo missions in subsequent years, with the last taking place in 1972. More than 50 years later, the US remains the only country to have achieved a crewed Moon landing.The Indian lander, Chandrayaan-3, blasted off from Earth on 14 July, packed with a payload of scientific equipment as well as a small, six-wheeled rover for exploration of the lunar surface. It's due to touch down on the lunar surface on 23 August after first sling-shotting around the Earth a few times and spending several weeks orbiting the Moon in preparation for the landing. The Russian lander, meanwhile, Luna-25, departed our planet only recently, taking off just after 2am Moscow time on 11 August (11pm GMT 10 August). It is taking a much faster, more direct route to the Moon and could reach the surface in as little as 10 days post-launch, on 21 August. Officials at the Russian space agency Roscosmos have made no secret about their desire to be first to make a soft landing at the Moon's South Pole.But Luna-25's journey might take slightly longer than that, meaning Chandrayaan-3 could arrive on the Moon first, in the end. Slow and steady could win this race.The missions, however, reflect the renewed interest in the Moon for space exploration. The recent discovery of significant pockets of water ice on our nearest celestial neighbour has excited scientists because hydrogen in the water could potentially be extracted to make rocket fuel at a future Moon base. Plus, the water might even be drinkable after treatment.The so-called race between Luna-25 and Chandrayaan-3 encapsulates a new era of lunar exploration, in which nations including the US, Israel, and China, as well as private companies, are targeting the Moon with spacecraft and forthcoming crewed missions. For many, it's just friendly competition. And yet, a fresh chapter of human exploration is at stake. The small steps taken by individual landers and crewed missions could add up to giant leaps in conquering the Solar System in the coming decades and centuries. Who gets there first really could matter.""It's turned out to be more of a coincidence than anything,"" says Wendy Whitman Cobb, professor of strategy and security studies at the US Air and Space Force's Air University, referring to the timing of the Luna-25 and Chandrayaan-3 missions. ""But it is a very interesting coincidence."" Luna-25's launch has been repeatedly delayed – it was originally scheduled for 2021.India has a ""leg up"", she says, since its spacecraft is already in orbit around the Moon. The Russians probably feel some pressure to get there first, though, she suggests, given their more direct route. Chandrayaan-3 is twice as heavy as Luna-25 and was also launched using a much less powerful rocket, meaning it needed to build up speed by taking large elliptical orbits around the Earth before it could swing out towards the Moon itself. Operators of the two craft will have to assure themselves of the performance of each vehicle before starting the touchdown procedure. Unexpected malfunctions could push the attempt back or scupper it entirely. They won't know how it's going to go, really, until they get there.National pride will probably be a factor in pushing ahead wherever possible. Russia is arguably hoping to prove its continued capabilities in space given that the country's space programme has been affected by sanctions following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. ""Their space industry has really, really suffered,"" says Whitman Cobb.But it's hardly a race to the Moon, as such, for Russia, says Stefania Paladini, who studies the space industry at Queen Margaret University in the UK, because the former Soviet Union succeeded in putting multiple landers and even rovers on the Moon 50 years ago. In that sense, the Russians won the race long ago and, clearly in homage to that, the name Luna-25 harks back to the last Russian lunar mission, Luna 24 in 1976. The Soviet Luna 1 space probe is regarded as the first spacecraft to reach the Moon (observers concluded that it was designed to impact the lunar body but instead passed it by, 3,725 miles (5,995km) above its surface) in 1959.Conversely, if Chandrayaan-3 touches down as planned, it ""would be the first time for India to actually succeed"", in achieving a ""soft landing"" on the Moon, says Paladini, noting how the nation's previous attempt, with the Chandrayaan-2 lander, ended in failure when the vehicle crashed onto the lunar surface in September 2019. (India has technically sent a spacecraft to the Moon's South Pole before with its Moon Impact Probe, which smashed into a ridge close to Shackleton Crater in November 2008, but it was far from being a soft landing and the spacecraft was never expected to survive the landing.)You might also like:What is new here is the targeted landing sites at the South Pole of the Moon. No spacecraft has ever touched down there successfully. All of the Apollo missions went to locations further north, near to the Moon's equator – those landing sites featured relatively smooth terrain and plenty of sunlight. At the South Pole, in contrast, the terrain is much bumper, littered with craters, and light from the Sun arrives at a harsher angle. (Read about how the boots worn by the next astronauts to walk on the Moon will cope with the conditions at the lunar South Pole.)""The sun is very low over the horizon,"" explains Jack Burns, a professor of astrophysics and planetary science at the University of Colorado Boulder. ""The shadows are very long, the Moon is very uniform in terms of its grey surface, so being able to differentiate between craters and boulders is going to be much more challenging.""The US aims to send a crewed mission, Artemis III, to the lunar South Pole as early as 2025, so learning from the experiences of robotic landers before that date will presumably be useful to some extent. But crewed spaceflight will always be much harder than uncrewed, notes Whitman Cobb. ""I don't even see it as being necessarily in the same league,"" she says.What really matters, going forward, is who is able to set up a sustained and worthwhile presence on the moon, argues Vishnu Reddy, professor of planetary sciences at the University of Arizona. He disapproves of talk of a race or competition between nations and private companies. ""Honestly, I think it's a distraction,"" he says. ""Competitions only take you to the flag. You can't have sustainable, long-term presence based on politics or trying to beat one nation or the other.""The scientific equipment aboard each lander is relatively similar, he points out. The vehicles will hopefully help scientists to better understand more about the crucial lunar water ice, minerals, and the Moon's limited atmosphere, among other things. Just getting a clearer picture of the lunar South Pole is helpful, as is proving the capacity to land safely in such a tricky location.There is another way of framing current expeditions to the Moon, though, says Anu Ojha, engagement, international and inspiration director at the UK Space Agency, who was previously involved in reviewing the Luna-25 mission before the invasion of Ukraine led the European Space Agency to discontinue its activities with Russia. Think of it like international ""architectures"" competing against one another, he suggests. The US, UK and India are among 27 countries signed up to the Artemis Accords. Meanwhile, Russia and China are collaborating on their own future Moon base, the International Lunar Research Station. Construction could begin as early as 2026. Luna-25 and Chandrayaan-3 are essentially early forays from each of these two international conglomerations.And the question that hovers over the lunar horizon is this: what next? What if we do set up lunar bases and begin extracting resources from the Moon for use in future space missions? The Outer Space Treaty, signed in 1967, establishes the fact that no nation can own the Moon. However, a subsequent treaty, known as the Moon Agreement, which more carefully defines that no nation can own resources on the Moon, has never been signed by key countries including the US, China and Russia.""What does that mean going forward, when you're mining resources? Does everybody have an equal claim?"" asks Burns, pondering the political headaches that will likely face new lunar pioneers. These headaches are going to have to be sorted out somehow, he notes. ""We don't want to end up in some territorial disputes on the Moon, things are bad enough on Earth.""For now, Luna-25 and Chandrayaan-3 fly silently through the vacuum of space, just small players in a human quest to explore the Moon and potentially expand the reach of our species into the vast Solar System beyond. These two landers are but tiny chess pieces on one very big board. But, as players of chess know, it is a game where every move counts.--Join one million Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter or Instagram.If you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called ""The Essential List"" – a handpicked selection of stories from BBC Future, Culture, Worklife, Travel and Reel delivered to your inbox every Friday.",Chandrayaan-3,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20230811-mission-to-the-moon-who-will-win-russian-and-indias-race-to-the-lunar-south-pole,BBC,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""framing"", ""reason"": ""The article frames the mission as a 'mini space race' and emphasizes the competitive aspect, while also highlighting the scientific and exploratory aspects.

73,The year India reached the Moon - and aimed for the Sun,"In India, 2023 will be remembered as the year we went to the Moon.On 23 August, massive celebrations broke out across the country when Chandrayaan-3 touched down in the lunar south pole region - an area on the Moon's surface that no-one had reached before.With this, India also joined an elite club of countries to achieve a soft landing on the Moon, after the US, the former Soviet Union and China.In the following months, India continued its journey into space - by sending an observation mission to the Sun and then by carrying out a key test flight ahead of its planned mission to take astronauts into space in 2025.We look back at an eventful year when India's strides into space made global headlines.It was ""20 minutes of terror"" for scientists at the Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) as the  Vikram lander, carrying the Pragyaan rover in its belly, began its descent to the Moon's surface.The lander's speed was gradually reduced from 1.68km per second to almost zero, enabling it to make a soft landing in the south pole region where the surface is ""very uneven"" and ""full of craters and boulders"".""India is on the Moon,"" a triumphant Isro chief S Somanath announced - and with that the country entered the history books.Over the next 10 days, space scientists - and the rest of the country - followed every move made by the lander and the rover as they gathered data and images and relayed them back to Earth for analysis.So we saw images of the six-wheeled rover sliding down from the lander's belly and taking its first steps on the lunar soil. Moving at a speed of 1cm per second, it ""traversed over 100m [328 feet]"" and at times re-routed to avoid falling into craters.Some of their findings that show a sharp difference in temperatures just above and below the lunar surface and confirmed presence of a host of chemicals, especially sulphur, in the soil have enthused space scientists and the scientific community at large.A proud Isro said the mission had not just completed its goals but also exceeded them.One of the highlights, Isro said, was Vikram's ""hop experiment"". The agency said that when the lander was ""commanded to fire its engines, it rose up by about 40cm [16 inches] and landed at a distance of 30-40cm"". This ""successful experiment"" means the spacecraft could be used in future to bring samples back to the Earth or for human missions, it added.And earlier this month Isro said it had successfully brought back into Earth's orbit a part of the rocket that carried Chandrayaan-3 to the Moon.The ""propulsion module"", which had detached from the Vikram lander after ferrying it close to the Moon, had re-entered Earth's orbit after a series of complex manoeuvres.Together, the hop experiment and the return of the propulsion module to Earth's orbit are crucial for Isro's future plans to bring back samples or return astronauts from Space.Just days after the Moon landing, India launched Aditya-L1 - its first observation mission to the Sun.The rocket that took off on 2 September is on a four-month 1.5 million km (932,000 miles)-journey from the Earth and is expected to reach its destination next week.That destination - called L1 or Lagrange point 1 - is at 1% of the Earth-Sun distance. It's the exact spot between where the gravitational forces of two large objects, such as the Sun and the Earth, cancel each other out, allowing a spacecraft to ""hover"".Once Aditya - named after the Hindu god of Sun - reaches this ""parking spot"", it would be able to orbit the Sun at the same rate as the Earth. From this vantage point, it will keep an eye on the Sun 24/7 and carry out scientific studies.The orbiter is carrying seven scientific instruments that will observe and study the solar corona (the outermost layer); the photosphere (the Sun's surface or the part we see from the Earth) and the chromosphere (a thin layer of plasma that lies between the photosphere and the corona).Isro says the studies will help scientists understand solar activity, such as the solar wind and solar flares, and their effect on Earth and space weather in real time.The agency has already shared some of the scientific data collected by the orbiter - and images taken by its camera have been watched millions of times on X (formerly Twitter).That's the key question that India's space agency tried to answer when it launched the Gaganyaan spacecraft on 21 October, the first in a series of test flights ahead of its planned mission to take astronauts into space in 2025.India has said it plans to place three astronauts into low-Earth orbit at an altitude of 400km for three days and the Isro chief has said Gaganyaan is their ""immediate priority"".""Send an Indian to space and bring them back safely - this is our immediate big-ticket target,"" Mr Somanath said.The test flight in October was to demonstrate whether the crew can safely escape the rocket in case it malfunctions.So, once the rocket had travelled about 12km in the sky, its abort systems were activated and a series of parachutes were deployed which brought it down safely in the waters of Bay of Bengal from where it was fished out by Indian navy divers.Since the test was successful, Isro has said it will first send a female humanoid - a robot that resembles a human - in an unmanned Gaganyaan spacecraft before finally sending astronauts into space.BBC News India is now on YouTube.

74,Ancient ocean of magma found on Moon south pole,"The Moon’s south pole was once covered in an ocean of liquid molten rock, according to scientists.The findings back up a theory that magma formed the Moon's surface around 4.5 billion years ago.Remnants of the ocean were found by India’s historic Chandrayaan-3 mission that landed on the south pole last August.The mission explored this isolated and mysterious area where no craft had ever landed before.The findings help back up an idea called the Lunar Magma Ocean theory about how the Moon formed.Scientists think that when the Moon formed 4.5 billion years ago, it began to cool and a lighter mineral called ferroan anorthosite floated to the surface. This ferroan anorthosite - or molten rock - formed the moon’s surface.The team behind the new findings found evidence of ferroan anorthosite in the south pole.“The theory of early evolution of the Moon becomes much more robust in the light of our observations,” said Dr Santosh Vadawale from the Physical Research Laboratory, who is co-author of the paper published in Nature on Wednesday.Before India’s mission, the main evidence of magma oceans was found in the mid-latitudes of the Moon as part of the Apollo programme.Prof Vandawale and his team were at mission control during Chandrayaan-3.“They were really exciting times. Sitting in the control room, moving the rover around on the lunar surface - that was really a once-in-a-lifetime experience,” says Prof Vadawale.When India's lander, called Vikram, made its celebrated soft landing on the south pole last August, a rover called Pragyaan drove out of the craft.Pragyaan rambled around the lunar surface for 10 days, while Prof Vadawale and his colleagues worked around the clock instructing it to collect data at 70 degree south latitude.The robot was built to withstand swings of temperature between 70C and -10C, and could make its own decisions about how to navigate the uneven and dusty lunar surface.It took 23 measurements with an instrument called an alpha particle X-ray spectrometer. This basically excites atoms and analyses the energy produced in order to identify the minerals in the Moon’s soil.The team of scientists also found evidence of a huge meteorite crash in the region four billion years ago.The crash is thought to have made the South Pole–Aitken basin, which is one of the largest craters in the solar system, measuring 2,500 km across.It is about 350km from the site India’s Praygam rover explored.But the scientists detected magnesium, which they believe was from deep inside the Moon, thrown up from the crash and propelled over the surface.“This would have been caused by a big impact of an asteroid, throwing out material from this big basin. In the process, it also excavated a deeper part of the Moon,” said Professor Anil Bhardwaj, director of India’s Physical Research Laboratory.The findings are just some of the scientific data collected during the Chandrayaan-3 mission which eventually hopes to discover ice water on the South Pole.That discovery would be a game-changer for space agencies’ dreams of building a human base on the Moon.India plans to launch another mission to the Moon in 2025 or 2026 when it hopes to collect and bring back to Earth samples from the lunar surface for analysis.",Chandrayaan-3,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2n0jgldn5o,BBC,"{""bias_detected"": ""no"", ""bias_type"": null, ""reason"": ""Article presents a neutral and informative report on the findings of the Chandrayaan-3 mission without promoting any particular agenda or viewpoint."", ""confidence"": 0.9}",no,none,no bias
75,India successfully conducts historic space-docking test,"Indian space agency Isro has for the first time successfully conducted space docking  by joining together two small craft in space.The technology is essential for the country's future ambition to build an Indian space station and put a person on the Moon.The mission, called SpaDeX, blasted off from Sriharikota launch pad in southern India on 30 December. The two spacecraft, launched on a single rocket, separated in space. The docking process, initially scheduled for 7 January, was rescheduled a number of times.On Thursday, the space agency announced it had created history by becoming only the fourth country to have docked spacecraft in orbit.Prime Minister Narendra Modi was at the Isro office in Bangalore as scientists carried out the test.""It is a significant stepping stone for India's ambitious space missions in the years to come,"" he later posted on X.Federal Science Minister Jitendra Singh expressed relief that the docking had ""finally"" happened.The two spacecraft on SpaDeX (short for Space Docking Experiment) are called SDX01 or the Chaser and SDX02 or the Target. Each weigh about 220kg (485lbs) and since their launch, they were travelling in space at a carefully chosen speed.""They were thrown into space together but at the time of separation, they were placed with different velocity to allow them to build a distance of 10-20km between them,"" Mila Mitra, a former Nasa scientist and co-founder of Delhi-based space education company Stem and Space, told the BBC.""During docking, scientists manoeuvred them to close that distance allowing them to mate,"" she added.The docking was initially scheduled for 7 January, but Isro later delayed it by two days saying they ""needed to carry out some more testing through simulations"" before the actual docking.The second time, it said there had been a glitch while trying to bring the satellites closer, but added that the spacecraft were safe.On Sunday, Isro said scientists had managed to reduce the distance between the Chaser and the Target first to 15metres and then to 3metres. They said after the trial attempt, the spacecraft were ""moved back to safe distance"" and that they were analysing data.S Somanath, who was Isro chief when SpaDeX (short for Space Docking Experiment) was launched and was monitoring its progress until his retirement a few days ago, had described docking as ""a very complex process"" that needed extreme precision and coordination.To begin with, the two spacecraft had to be in the same orbit so that the Chaser could start to approach the Target.On Thursday morning, scientists began by gradually reducing the speed of the two spacecraft - bringing them ever closer until they were just 3 metres apart. Then their connectors were latched together.In the next step, the two spacecraft were screwed on perfectly, creating an airtight passage for safe transfer of material or crew, completing space docking.An Isro official told the BBC that over the next two-three days, the mission will carry out what is being billed as one of its most important experiments - it will transfer electrical power from the Chaser to Target.This, Ms Mitra, says is to demonstrate that a spacecraft can be sent to service another in space.The experiment will then demonstrate ""undocking and separation of the two satellites"".Ms Mitra says the mission will also test India's capabilities for inter-satellite communication as during the docking and undocking, the spacecraft will have to communicate with the Earth station and also with each other so that they know each other's position and velocity.The spacecraft are also carrying scientific instruments and cameras which will then be deployed. Over the next two years, they will measure radiation in space and monitor natural resources on Earth.Isro, known for economising its missions, is also using a part of the rocket that carried SpaDeX to space - which in normal circumstances would become space debris - to conduct some important experiments in orbit for three months.Poem – short for PS4-Orbital Experiment Module - is carrying 24 payloads and has already carried out two successful experiments.The first demonstrated seed germination. Last week, Isro tweeted a video saying that ""cowpea sprouts have unveiled their first leaves in space in micro-gravity"". Micro-gravity is the near-weightless condition experienced aboard spacecraft.Scientists say it's great news as it means that future astronauts could produce food during long-duration missions.The second experiment involves the robotic arm which, Ms Mitra says, is among the rocket's most important payloads. A video on Isro's X account shows the robotic arm moving to grab a piece of space debris.Ms Mitra says this arm will play ""a crucial role during the building of the space station as it could be used to capture and put things in place"". It will also come in handy in Chandrayaan-4 - India's next mission to the Moon which will aim to collect and bring back lunar soil samples, she adds.Follow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.",Chandrayaan-3,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8j89k02py0o,BBC,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""source"", ""reason"": ""The article relies heavily on Isro officials and a former Nasa scientist (Mila Mitra) who is also the co-founder of a space education company, providing a positive and supportive perspective."", ""confidence"": 0.8}",no,none,no source bias
76,India says it killed militants who shot dead tourists in Kashmir,"India has said its security forces killed three militants who shot dead 26 civilians near a tourist town in Indian-administered Kashmir in April, triggering a brief military conflict with Pakistan.Home Minister Amit Shah told parliament the men had been killed by Indian forces near the disputed region's main city Srinagar on Monday.He claimed the attackers were Pakistani nationals, a charge Islamabad denies. The men's identity was confirmed through forensic and ballistic tests, Shah told MPs.Pakistan has not commented on the claims, which have not been independently confirmed and come amid mounting criticism of India's government for alleged security lapses in Kashmir.Twenty-six men, mostly Hindu tourists, were killed by gunmen who opened fire at a mountain meadow not far from the scenic town of Pahalgam on 22 April, in one of the deadliest attacks in the region in recent years.The victims were killed in cold blood in front of their wives and family members. A local Muslim pony handler who tried to help them was also shot dead.Delhi accused Islamabad of supporting militant groups involved in the attack - a charge Pakistan has repeatedly denied. In May, India launched a series of strikes on sites in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir.Pakistan responded with drones, missiles and fighter jets, leading to four days of intense military action from both sides.Dozens of people were killed in the bloodiest confrontation between India and Pakistan in decades, before US President Donald Trump announced a ceasefire between them.India's opposition leaders have accused the government of ""severe security lapses"" and have been questioning why it has taken this much time to catch the attackers.In parliament on Monday, Congress MP Gaurav Gogoi demanded that Shah should personally take responsibility for the attack.""The country wants to know why the government has not been able to nab the terrorists even after 100 days since the attack,"" he said.Shah responded on Tuesday, saying that security forces had ""neutralised the three terrorists"" involved in the attack in a mission called ""Operation Mahadev"".The three died in a gun battle in a wildlife reserve in the mountains of Dachigam, about 30km (18 miles) from Srinagar, the Indian army said on Monday. The clash could not be independently confirmed by the BBC. The army did not immediately identify those it killed.But on Tuesday, Shah claimed the men - who he identified as Suleiman Shah, Afghan and Jibran - were Pakistani nationals.""When the terrorists were killed [on Monday], we recovered three rifles - one M9 American rifle and two AK-47s. The cartridges we had collected were also from an M9 and AK-47. We sent the rifles last night to the central forensics lab in Chandigarh where they fired them, and these were then compared and it was confirmed these were the three rifles used in the attack to kill our innocent citizens,"" Shah said.""I have the ballistic report,"" he told the house, holding up some papers. ""Six scientists have cross verified it. They told me this morning on a video call these are 100% the bullets that they had fired.""At the beginning of the investigation in May, Indian police had issued sketches of three men, saying two were Pakistanis while one was a local man.But in June, Indian investigators said all three militants were Pakistani nationals from the UN-proscribed militant group Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) after it arrested two locals for allegedly sheltering the suspected militants prior to the attack.However, on Tuesday, Shah clarified that only two men - Suleiman Shah and Afghan - were believed to be LeT members. He did not say which group the Indian authorities thought the third militant Jibran was associated with.The militants were identified by locals who had provided them shelter, he claimed.""We have voter ID numbers of the two of them, we have weapons recovered from them. The chocolates recovered from them are also made in Pakistan,"" Shah said.""They killed our tourists and now they have been killed.""Shah also defended the speed of the investigation amid questions on how the three men had managed to remain undetected over the past three months.""Right after the attack, we handed over the investigation to the National Investigation Agency (NIA),"" he said.""We made all arrangements with the security and border forces to ensure they [culprits] couldn't leave the country.""Some opposition leaders, however, remained unconvinced and questioned the lack of security in Pahalgam on the day of the attack.""Why was not even one security personnel present there?""

77,India denies it was pressured into ending conflict with Pakistan,"India's defence ministry has rejected US President Donald Trump's claim of ending its conflict with Pakistan in May, saying the country had not responded to pressure from anyone.Rajnath Singh was speaking at the opening of a parliamentary debate on the 22 April attack in Pahalgam, in Indian-administered Kashmir, which claimed the lives of 26 tourists.India blamed Pakistan for the attack - which it denied - and launched a series of strikes, named ""Operation Sindoor"", on its neighbour, leading to four days of intense military action from both sides.Trump has frequently claimed that the ceasefire between the two nuclear-armed neighbours was brokered by the US - which India has denied.On Monday, Singh reiterated that it was ""completely incorrect and baseless to say that the military action was stopped because of pressure"".""India halted its operation because all the political and military objectives studied before and during the conflict had been fully achieved,"" he told the Lok Sabha, the lower house of parliament.He also claimed the decision was taken after a request from Pakistan's Director General of Military Operations (DGMO), who ""pleaded for relief"".""It was only after this that the Indian Armed Forces decided to pause operations,"" he added. Islamabad has not commented on Singh's claims.The escalation in May was the worst military confrontation between India and Pakistan in decades, with dozens of people killed in the four-day fighting, before Trump announced a ceasefire between them.Singh said the purpose of India's military action was ""to destroy the terror nurseries raised by Pakistan over the years"".He said over 100 ""terrorists, their trainers, handlers and associates"" were killed in coordinated strikes on nine ""terror infrastructure targets"" in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered-Kashmir in an operation that lasted 22 minutes.""The objective was to provide justice to the families who lost their loved ones in the Pahalgam terror attack,"" he said.During the proceedings, opposition leaders questioned the government about Islamabad's claim that it shot down five Indian fighter jets and a drone during the conflict.Singh denied this and said India's defence systems had intercepted all incoming projectiles and missiles, adding that no Indian military establishment suffered any damage.He also said the Indian armed forces could resume military action if there was any further ""misadventure"" from the Pakistan side.Earlier in the day, the Indian army said that it had killed ""three terrorists"" in a gun battle in Indian-administered Kashmir.Indian TV channels claimed the three were suspected to be behind the April attack - but officials have not confirmed this.Indian investigators have previously said all three militants involved in the deadly attack were Pakistani nationals from the UN-proscribed militant group Lashkar-e-TaibaFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook.",Operation Sindoor,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y204pmrp2o,BBC,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""source"", ""reason"": ""The article relies on Indian Defence Ministry's rejection of Trump's claim without providing a direct quote from Pakistan's side, indicating a preference for Indian sources."", ""confidence"": 0.8}",no,none,no source bias
78,The beauty and brutality of life in the shadow of Kashmir killings,"A centuries-old Persian couplet often repeated in Indian-administered Kashmir translates to: ""If there is a paradise on earth, it is here, it is here, it is here."" And many Kashmiris insist it was written with Pahalgam in mind.The small town, nestled between tall Himalayan mountains with a gurgling Lidder River flowing through it, is called the mini-Switzerland of India.The valleys and meadows here have long provided stunning locations for Bollywood romances and attracted tens of thousands of tourists escaping the heat and dust of Indian plains.But on 22 April, the tranquil valley hit global headlines when a sprawling meadow here turned into killing fields.Militants singled out male Hindu tourists and murdered 25 of them in front of their families in Baisaran, a beauty spot about 7km from the town. A local Muslim pony handler who tried to help tourists was also shot dead.The massacre brought nuclear-armed India and Pakistan to the brink of war. India blamed Pakistan for the killings – an accusation Islamabad denied – and the two countries attacked each other with missiles and drones over four days in May after which a fragile truce was agreed.But in Pahalgam, time seems to have slowed down and the residents are trying to pick up the pieces and move on.When I recently visited Pahalgam, where a large majority makes a living through tourism, I found a land and its people trying to deal with the collective trauma, mourning the loss of lives - and livelihoods. The peak tourist season here is April to June - and this year, most of it has already been lost.""What happened here is condemnable… an inhuman act. Innocent people were killed,"" says Javeed Burza, president of Pahalgam Hotels and Restaurants association.Standing in the rear lawns of his hotel, he watches the Lidder roar past. On the other side are huge mountains covered by a thick carpet of trees. It's this sort of view that made this valley in south Kashmir such a sought-after destination.Mr Burza says visitors came from all over India for its lakes, forests, meadows and glaciers – and went back raving about the local people and their hospitality.""People here are poor, they live hand-to-mouth, but they are known to be very kind and helpful. Now we are all facing the consequences of this senseless violence,"" he adds. ""We had bookings right until the end of June. But then everything fell apart like a pack of cards. There's not much left here now.""The region's Chief Minister Omar Abdullah says in the immediate aftermath of the attack, tourists fled the town and people who were proposing to come cancelled.To persuade tourists to give Pahalgam another chance, he visited the town within weeks of the attack, held a cabinet meeting there and, ignoring advice of security officials, cycled through the streets.For Mr Abdullah, Pahalgam's wellbeing is personal.""It's where our school picnics were; it's where we probably first dipped our toes in running water. For some of us it's the first time we went white water rafting or trout fishing. For others, it's a day or overnight visit. For us, it's part of our growing up.""Mr Abdullah says it's always hard to make predictions but he hopes to see Pahalgam ""where it was on 21 April this year"".On that day, it was packed with tourists, says Fayyaz Ahmad, who sells Kashmiri embroidered shawls and dresses in Pahalgam's main market, with shops lining both sides of the only road that passes through the town.Many remain shuttered, but a few have begun to open in the hope of attracting customers. The day I met him was the first he'd opened his shop since the killings.The last three seasons – post-Covid years – had been marked by bumper visits, Mr Ahmad says.""Every morning at least 3,000 cars would arrive by 11am. There would be traffic jams lasting two-three hours. Many tourists would say they couldn't find accommodation.""His own shop sometimes got so crowded that a queue of shoppers would form outside. ""Business was brisk,"" he said. But now he's had to let three salesmen go. They would be rehired only if business picked up, he said.The targeting of tourists has left him bewildered. Since 1989, when an anti-India militancy gripped Kashmir valley, Mr Ahmad says, ""the situation was really bad here"".""We were afraid to step out of our homes, but tourists who chose to come here were never harmed. We can't understand why they've been targeted now. Who could do such a thing?"" he asks.India blamed Pakistan-backed militants for the massacre in a region that both countries claim in full, but control only in parts.Delhi accuses its neighbour of fuelling a long-running insurgency that has killed tens of thousands in Indian-administered Kashmir. Islamabad has long denied backing militants there.In recent years, the insurgency had abated, bringing millions of tourists and a growing sense that the region was finally becoming safer. But that has now changed.""Pahalgam ke naam par dhabba lag gaya [Pahalgam's name is stained],"" laments Nisar Ali, an 80-year-old resident who makes a living by selling papier mache products.""People had taken loans to open shops and buy taxis, now everyone is staring at an uncertain future. What's happened to our paradise,"" he asks.Just 2km from the market, a signboard points to the untarred road that goes up to Baisaran, a 5km trek covered on foot or ponies. The concertina wire used to barricade the road has been moved to one side and local people and flocks of sheep can be seen making their way down.Before the killings, it was one of the most popular places for tourists. The meadow offering a great view of the valley was open from 08:00 to 17:00 and would get thousands of visitors daily in the summer.But it remains out of bounds now. Two men have been arrested for allegedly providing shelter to the militants, but those who carried out the killings have still not been caught - leading to fears that they could return.Abdul Wahid Wani, the president of Pahalgam pony owners' union, who was the first to arrive at the scene, says 1,090 tourists had gone up to the meadow until 14:00.At the time of the attack, there were about 300 tourists in Baisaran, he estimates.At 14:36, he says, he received a call from the police asking him if he had heard anything about an incident at Baisaran.""I tried calling colleagues who had taken tourists up to the meadow, but no-one answered. I figured something was wrong and my brother and I ran all the way up and reached there at 15:10.""The police and paramilitaries arrived 15 minutes later. That night, Mr Wani, wrapped up at 02:30. He says what he saw there keeps him awake at nights.""I saw women and children crying and screaming. I saw bodies on the ground. I saw 10-15 people injured.""In the first videos of the aftermath that went viral on the day of the attack, Mr Wani can be heard trying to reassure the survivors, offering them water, telling them he was there to help.He summoned other pony handlers who arrived at the scene to help evacuate people - ""carrying them down on our backs and wooden cots"" - and gather bodies strewn about the vast field.""I still can't forget what I saw that day. I panicked; I had palpitations. I'd never seen anything like that before.""When I met him in Pahalgam, he looked tired, his eyes sunk deep into his lined face.""For many nights I couldn't sleep and sleep still eludes me. With the militants still on the loose, I worry what will happen if they come after us because we helped people they were trying to kill?""But earlier this week, we exchanged messages and he sounded more optimistic.The town has sprung back to life, with thousands of pilgrims arriving to take part in Amarnath Yatra - the annual Hindu pilgrimage to the Amarnath cave shrine. It began on 3 July and will go on until 9 August.Dozens of camps have been set up and thousands of police and security forces have been deployed along the route to ensure security.Pahalgam is one of the two starting points for the trek to the shrine – and as many pilgrims hire ponies to take them part of the way, there's a steady stream of work for Mr Wani and his colleagues.But hoteliers and shop-owners say they will have to wait for their turn until after the end of the pilgrimage since most pilgrims stay in cheaper camps and rarely purchase crafts.But many are taking heart from the fact that tourists have begun returning to the region. Ravi Gosain, president of All India Tour Operators, says in June, 40% of more than 45,000 tourists who visited the Kashmir Valley went to Pahalgam.On the day I visited, there were families stopping for photographs under a ""Love Pahalgam"" sign.Shabiba and Hamid Jaffar, who had visited last year around the same time, said it was so crowded then that they had to wait for half an hour to be able to take a photo here.""When we decided to come this year, our friends tried to discourage us saying it's not safe,"" says Shabiba. ""But it's totally safe and my children are so happy that they are saying let's move to Kashmir.""Mr Jaffar says their friends are calling them after seeing their photos.

79,Indian investigators now claim all Pahalgam attackers were Pakistan nationals,"Indian investigators say all three militants involved in April's deadly attack on tourists near Indian-administered Kashmir's Pahalgam town were Pakistani nationals from the UN-proscribed militant group Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT).Police had earlier issued sketches of three men saying two were Pakistanis while one was a local man.The claim by the National Investigative Agency (NIA) came after it arrested two local men for allegedly sheltering the attackers. Pakistan has not commented on these claims.It had earlier rejected involvement in the attacks in which 26 people were killed. The attack in Baisaran, a popular tourist spot, had brought  India and Pakistan on the brink of war.The nuclear-armed South Asian neighbours, who have fought three wars over Kashmir, claim the region in full but administer it in parts.The killings on 22 April had sent shockwaves through India and the case was handed over to NIA, a federal investigative agency.Security forces had launched a major search and combing operation in the region and thousands were detained across Kashmir for questioning.The three attackers are, however, yet to be caught.In a statement on Sunday, NIA said the arrested men had ""knowingly harboured the three armed terrorists at a seasonal dhol (hut)"" before the 22 April attack. It did not give details of when the arrests took place and as those arrested are in custody, they have not made any statement.A little-known group, The Resistance Front (TRF), allied with the Lashkar-e-Taiba, had initially said it was behind the attack but later disowned it.Within days of the attack, India revoked the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty, a long-standing water-sharing agreement with Pakistan. Islamabad, in turn, withdrew from the 1972 Simla agreement that sought to settle differences through bilateral negotiations and peaceful means.India followed it by launching air and missile attacks on 7 May, targeting sites it called ""terror infrastructure in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir"".Pakistan denied the claim that these were terror camps and also responded by firing missiles and deploying drones into Indian territory.The hostilities between the two countries continued until 10 May when US President Donald Trump announced a ceasefire.Follow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook",Operation Sindoor,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c36xe95g06zo,BBC,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""source"", ""reason"": ""The article relies on Indian investigators' claims without providing a direct quote or statement from Pakistan's side, despite mentioning that Pakistan has not commented on these claims."", ""confidence"": 0.8}",no,none,no source bias
80,'Tourists are our lifeline': Picking up the pieces in Kashmir after April killings,"Two months after a deadly attack in Indian-administered Kashmir scared away tourists and brought India and Pakistan to the brink of war, the picturesque valley nestled in the Himalayan mountains is beginning to see the first signs of a tourism revival.Shabana Awwal is making videos of her children as they take turns to get on a water bike for a ride on the Dal Lake, Srinagar city's most iconic tourist spot.Ms Awwal has travelled from the western state of Rajasthan with her husband and children in a group of 15 - all members of their extended family.""I've visited Kashmir many times and seen all the major attractions such as Gulmarg, Sonmarg and Pahalgam and wanted to show all these places to my relatives,"" she tells the BBC.The Awwals had planned their 10-day trip in March. ""Summer in Rajasthan is unbearably hot so we'd planned to escape to Kashmir during the children's school vacation,"" she says.But since she planned the trip, the circumstances here have drastically changed. On 22 April, militants attacked tourists visiting a beauty spot near Pahalgam town, killing 26 men.Tourism is the mainstay of the economy of Jammu and Kashmir, a federally-administered territory, and this unprecedented targeting of tourists sent shockwaves through India. The authorities closed down 48 tourist destinations in the valley and two-thirds of them still remain shut.Chief Minister Omar Abdullah, who's been lobbying hard to reopen these spots to attract visitors to the region, says ""the impact of the attack was immediate and very widely felt"".""There was a mass exodus of those tourists who were already here, and a mass cancellation of those who were proposing to come. Then India and Pakistan, for all intents and purposes, were almost at war for a couple of days in May,"" Abdullah told the BBC.""So the lasting impact has been felt both in the deterioration of relations between the two neighbouring countries and our tourism season for the year is going to be, what word do I use for it? I guess you can call it a disaster.""Kashmir, claimed by both India and Pakistan, has been a flashpoint for decades. The nuclear-armed South Asian neighbours have fought two wars and a limited conflict over Kashmir. For more than a quarter of a century, the region has seen an armed insurgency against Indian rule, but even at its peak, tourists were rarely targeted.Ms Awwal said her family decided to continue with their holiday because ""we weren't really afraid"" and ""we thought we'll deal with whatever came our way"".""We are happy that we went ahead with our plans. The situation here is normal,"" she says and blames the ""media hype"" for the impression that it's unsafe to travel to Kashmir.The Awwals are not alone in their optimism. Deepti and Anuj Gandhi of Jammu who made their plans just last week say ""there's no summer holiday destination better than Kashmir"".""The children love to ride water bikes and then we'll go boating in the lake. We come here every year, so why break the tradition now?"" she says.Earlier this week, news agency ANI reported that a group of Polish tourists had arrived in the city.The arrivals merely weeks after the Pahalgam attack are a cause of optimism for hoteliers, taxi drivers, tour guides, shopkeepers and owners of shikaras – the Venetian gondola-like narrow colourful wooden boats that ferry tourists on the Dal Lake.In April, president of the shikara owners' association Haji Wali Mohammad Bhat says, the Dal Lake boulevard was packed with thousands of tourists, there were daily traffic jams and many complained they were finding it hard to get accommodation.""The attack on tourists was unfortunate and tragic,"" he says.""It has affected all of us and our livelihoods. Tourists are our life, tourism is our lifeline. God knows what sin we're paying for,"" he adds, despairingly.Ravi Gosain, president of Indian Association of Tour Operators, who recently led a three-day ""fact-finding trip"" of tour operators - as ""they are the ones who send travellers to Kashmir"" says ""for the past few years tourism was flourishing in Kashmir, lots of new hotels had been built, new vehicles were bought and new shops had opened"".Last year, the government said 23.6 million tourists visited Jammu and Kashmir, with 3.49 million visiting the valley.This year, Mr Gosain says, the peak season has been lost in the valley, but tourism can still pick up.""Locals are very welcoming, hoteliers, tour guides and shopkeepers are very friendly and people are coming back. You can see it – all flights are coming in full, tourism is bouncing back quickly.""I think the national sentiment is that if the purpose of the attack was to derail tourism, then it won't succeed. But I hope no untoward incident happens again,"" he adds.According to reports, some of the credit for the revival of tourism in Kashmir also goes to a new train link that has for the first time connected Srinagar with the rest of India.The twice-daily train from Srinagar to Katra station, in Jammu region – which recently made headlines for passing over ""the world's highest single-arch railway bridge"" – has been running packed and tickets have been sold out for the next two months.Katra, which is the starting point for those visiting the popular Hindu shrine of Vaishno Devi, attracted 9.48 million pilgrims last year.And many of those arriving there since 7 June, when the spanking new air-conditioned train was commissioned, have been hopping on it to go to Kashmir.Among the pilgrims taking advantage of the easy connectivity is Ghanshyam Bharadwaj and his wife Mamata Sharma and their children. For the Delhi-based couple enjoying hot sugary tea near the Dal Lake, coming to Srinagar was ""a spur of the moment decision"".""It took us just three hours from Katra.

81,"An Indian teacher was killed - then he got falsely labelled a ""terrorist""","Farooq Ahmed still bristles with anger when he talks about his brother's death.Mohammad Iqbal, a resident of Poonch city in Indian-administered Kashmir, died in cross-border shelling on 7 May, the morning after India launched a series of air strikes in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir in retaliation to a militant attack in the town of Pahalgam that killed 26 people. Pakistan has denied having any role in the attack.Mr Ahmed says that Iqbal died where he had worked for more than two decades - Zia-ul-Uloom, a madrassa, or a religious centre focused on Islamic teachings, in Poonch.But his death, it turned out, was just the beginning of the family's troubles.As the news spread, several media channels falsely accused Iqbal of being a terrorist, following which the police put out a statement refuting the claim.""My brother was a teacher but they saw his beard and skullcap and branded him a terrorist,"" Mr Ahmed says.""It was like having salt rubbed into our wounds. We had lost Iqbal and then the media defamed him. The dead can't defend themselves.""Indian officials say that a total of 16 people, including Iqbal, were killed in the cross-border shelling during the four-day military conflict that broke out between India and Pakistan following the airstrikes.Pakistan has claimed 40 civilian deaths, though, it remains unclear how many of these were directly caused by the shelling.The two nuclear-armed countries have shared a tense relationship for decades, as both administer the Himalayan region of Kashmir in part, but claim it in full.They have fought three wars over Kashmir since independence from Britain in 1947 and came back from the brink of another one earlier this month.But as the military conflict escalated, another battle played out on social media - a disinformation war of claims and counterclaims that circulated online and on TV.Just like rumours about Iqbal's identity, other misleading and inaccurate information also found its way into some mainstream news channels and websites.This included claims such as India having destroyed Pakistan's Karachi port, which was later debunked by the Indian government.Some of the other fabrications were harder to spot, like an AI-generated video of a Pakistan army general claiming that his country had lost two aircraft in combat.""The scale of misinformation and fact-free assertions being broadcast by the media was shocking,"" says Manisha Pande, managing editor at Newslaundry, an independent news platform.She notes that while a degree of sensationalism is expected as channels compete for viewership, ""the jingoistic and irresponsible coverage"" of the conflict was unprecedented in its intensity — and unlike anything she had witnessed before.No one knows this better than Mr Ahmed.""I don't know where news channels got the information about my brother from,"" Mr Ahmed says.""Who did they speak to? What kind of evidence did they have that my brother was a terrorist?"" he asks.Weeks later, the family is still reeling from the tragedy.Mr Ahmed says that on 7 May, his brother left home for the madrassa in the morning as usual, but it was his body that returned home. By noon, they had buried him in a nearby cemetery.For some time, the family had no idea about the misinformation that was being shared by some news outlets. They were busy performing Iqbal's last rites.It was only hours later that a relative received a WhatsApp forward - a video clip of a prominent news channel claiming that the Indian army had killed a terrorist, with Iqbal's photo flashing on the screen.""We were shocked. Soon, we began getting more calls from people asking us what was going on and why was the media calling Iqbal a terrorist,"" Mr Ahmed says.The claim was shared by some prominent channels, including Zee News, ABP and News18. The BBC has reached out to the channels for comment.One channel claimed that Iqbal was killed in an ""Indian strike on a terrorist camp"" in Pakistan-administered Kashmir, and that he was a terrorist with Pakistan-based terror group Lashkar-e-Taiba.""Our family members have been staying in Poonch for generations. How can they say my brother was living in Pakistan? They [the media] should be ashamed,"" Mr Ahmed says.The accusation against Iqbal was circulated so widely and swiftly that on 8 May, the Poonch police put out a statement, clarifying that Iqbal had died in cross-border shelling in the madrasa.""Poonch Police strongly refutes such false narratives. The deceased, Maulana Mohd Iqbal, was a respected religious figure in the local community and had no affiliation with any terror outfit,"" the statement said, adding that legal action would be taken against any media outlet or individual who circulated the fake news.But for Mr Ahmed, the statement was too little too late.""By then, the false claim would've already reached millions of people in India,"" he says.He adds that except for one channel, News18, no one else had publicly apologised to him or their viewers for the mistake.Mr Ahmed says he wants to take legal action against the channels, but the process would have to wait as the family is struggling to make ends meet.Iqbal is survived by his two wives and eight children. He was the only earning member in his family.Mr Ahmed says that the compensation given by the government, which amounts to a few million rupees, will last only for a year or two and they must start planning for the future now.""The whole family depended on my brother. He was a quiet and gentle man who loved teaching children,"" Mr Ahmed says.""But who's going to tell this to the world? For many people, my brother is still a terrorist whose killing is justified. How will they understand our pain?""Additional reporting by Auqib Javeed in Srinagar in Indian-administered KashmirFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.",Operation Sindoor,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c17rw0vy0glo,BBC,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""labeling"", ""reason"": ""Loaded labels/titles ('terrorist') applied asymmetrically to the deceased without parity across actors."", ""confidence"": 0.8}",yes,framing,frames indian anti terrorist attcks negatively
82,Is China the winner in the India-Pakistan conflict?,"The four-day conflict between arch-rivals India and Pakistan this month ended with a ceasefire and both claiming victory – but it now appears that China's defence industry might also be an unlikely winner.The latest flare-up began on 7 May when India launched attacks on what it called ""terrorist infrastructure"" inside Pakistan in response to the brutal killing of 26 people, mostly tourists by militants in Pahalgam on 22 April.Many of them were killed in the scenic valley in Indian-administered Kashmir in front of their wives and family members. Delhi accused Islamabad of supporting militant groups involved in the carnage, a charge Pakistan denied.After India's response - which it called Operation Sindoor - to the militant attack, tit-for-tat military manoeuvres from both sides followed, involving drones, missiles and fighter jets.India reportedly used its French and Russian-made jets, while Pakistan deployed its J-10 and J-17 aircraft, which Islamabad co-produces with Beijing. Both sides say their jets did not cross the border and they were firing missiles at each other from a distance.Islamabad claims that its fighter aircraft shot down at least six Indian planes, including the newly-acquired French-made Rafale fighter jets. Delhi hasn't responded to these claims.""Losses are a part of combat,"" Air Marshal AK Bharti of the Indian Air Force (IAF) said last week when a reporter asked him about these claims. Air Marshal Bharti declined to comment on the specific claim of Pakistan downing Indian jets.""We have achieved the objectives that we selected, and all our pilots are back home,"" he added.India said it had killed at least ""100 terrorists"" while targeting the headquarters of the banned Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed militant outfits based in Pakistan.A definitive account of what really happened in the aerial battle is yet to emerge. Some media outlets reported plane crashes in the state of Punjab and Indian-administered Kashmir around the same time but the Indian government has not responded to the reports.A Reuters report quoting American officials said Pakistan possibly had used the Chinese-made J-10 aircraft to launch air-to-air missiles against Indian fighter jets. Pakistan claiming victory after hugely relying on Chinese weapons systems in an active combat situation is being seen by some experts as a boost for Beijing's defence industry but some also disagree with the claim.Some of the experts have called this a ""DeepSeek moment"" for the Chinese weapons industry, referring to January this year when the Chinese AI start-up shook US giants with its cost-effective technology.""The aerial fight was a big advertisement for the Chinese weapons industry. Until now, China had no opportunity to test its platforms in a combat situation,"" Zhou Bo, a retired senior colonel in the Chinese People's Liberation Army, told the BBC.The Beijing-based analyst said the outcome of the air duel showed ""China has some systems that are next to none"". Shares in the Chinese Avic Chengdu Aircraft company, that manufactures fighter jets like the J-10, surged by up to 40% last week after the reported performance of the fighter jet in the India-Pakistan conflict.Other experts, however, feel it's too early to declare the superiority of Chinese weapons systems.Professor Walter Ladwig from the King's College in London said it was yet to be determined whether the Chinese jets had actually outmanoeuvred the Indian Air Force (IAF) planes, particularly the Rafale.""In a standard military doctrine, you would suppress the enemy's air defences and get air superiority before you struck ground targets. Instead, it appears the IAF's mission was clearly not to provoke any Pakistani military retaliation,"" he said.Mr Ladwig thought that the Indian pilots were given instructions to fly despite the fact that the entire Pakistani air defence was on high alert and their jets were already in the sky. The IAF hasn't given details of the mission or about its air operations strategy.Beijing also hasn't made any comment on reports of the J-10 taking down Indian fighter jets, including the Rafale. But unconfirmed reports of the J-10 bringing down a Western weapon system has triggered jubilation and triumphalism on Chinese social media.Carlotta Rinaudo, a China researcher at the International Team for the Study of Security in Verona, said Chinese social media was flooded with nationalistic messages even though it's difficult to reach a conclusion with the available information.""At the moment perception matters way more than reality. If we see it in that way, the main winner is really China,"" she said.For China, Pakistan is a strategic and economic ally. It is investing more than $50bn (£37bn) to build infrastructure in Pakistan as part of its China-Pakistan Economic corridor.So, a weak Pakistan is not in China's interest.China made a critical difference in the latest India-Pakistan conflict, says Imtiaz Gul, a Pakistani security analyst. ""It took the Indian planners by sheer surprise. They didn't probably envision the depth of co-operation in the modern warfare between Pakistan and China,"" he said.Experts say the performance of the Chinese jets in a real combat situation was keenly analysed in Western capitals as this will have cascading impact on global arms trade. The US is the world's largest arms exporter, while China is the fourth.China sells weapons mostly to developing countries like Myanmar and Pakistan. Previously the Chinese weapon systems were criticised for their poor quality and technical problems.Reports said the Burmese military grounded several of its JF-17 fighter jets – jointly manufactured by China and Pakistan in 2022 – due to technical malfunctions.The Nigerian military reported several technical problems with the Chinese made F-7 fighter jets.Another point to be noted is that this was not the first time that India lost an aircraft to Pakistan.In 2019, during a brief air battle between the two sides following similar Indian air strikes on suspected terrorist targets in Pakistan, a Russian-made MiG-21 jet was shot down inside Pakistani territory and the pilot was captured. He was released a few days later.India, however, said that the pilot had ejected after successfully shooting down Pakistani fighter jets, including a US-made F-16. Pakistan has denied the claim.Despite reports of the downing of Indian jets last week, experts like Mr Ladwig argue that India was able to hit an ""impressive breadth of targets"" inside Pakistan early in the morning of 10 May and this fact has gone largely unnoticed by the international media.The Indian military said in a co-ordinated attack, it launched missiles on 11 Pakistani air bases across the country, including the strategic Nur Khan air base outside Rawalpindi, not far from the Pakistani military headquarters. It's a sensitive target that took Islamabad by surprise.One of the furthest targets was in Bholari, 140km (86 miles) from the southern city of Karachi.Mr Ladwig says this time the IAF operated with standard procedures - first attacking Pakistani air defence and radar systems and then focusing on ground targets.The Indian jets used an array of missiles, loitering munitions and drones despite the Pakistanis operating the Chinese-provided HQ 9 air defence system.""It seems the attacks were relatively precise and targeted. The craters were in the middle of runways, exactly the ideal spot. If it were a longer conflict, how long would it take the Pakistani Air Force to get these facilities up and running again, I can't say,"" Mr Ladwig pointed out.Nevertheless, he said, by refusing to get into the details of the mission briefing, India's military ""lost control of the narrative thread"".In response to the Indian strikes, Pakistan said it launched missile and air strikes on several Indian forward air bases, but Delhi said the attacks caused no damage to equipment and personnel.Realising that the situation was getting out of control, the US and its allies intervened and put pressure on both countries to stop the fighting.But for India, experts say, the whole episode is a wake-up call.Beijing may not comment on the details of the recent India-Pakistan conflict, but it's keen to show that its weapon systems are fast catching up with the West.Delhi is aware that the jets China has supplied to Pakistan are some of the earlier models. Beijing has already inducted the more advanced J-20 stealth fighter jets, that can evade radars.India and China have a long-standing border dispute along the Himalayas and fought a brief border war in 1962 that resulted in a defeat for India. A brief border clash took place in Ladakh in June 2020.Experts say India is acutely aware that it needs to accelerate investments in its homegrown defence manufacturing industry and speed up international buying.For now, China's defence industry seems to be enjoying the limelight following the claims of success of one of its aircraft in the India-Pakistan conflict.Follow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook",Operation Sindoor,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1w3dln352vo,BBC,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""framing"", ""reason"": ""The article frames the conflict as a 'win' for China's defence industry, highlighting its success in a real combat situation and implying that it has surpassed Western weapon systems."", ""confidence"": 0.8}",yes,framing,"frames the conflict as a 'win' for China's defence industry, highlighting its success in a real combat situation and implying that it has surpassed Western weapon systems"
83,Relief in Kashmir - but BBC hears from families on both sides mourning the dead,"Sixteen-year-old Nimra stood outside, rooted to the spot, as the Indian missiles that had woken her a moment ago rained down on the mosque a few metres from her house in Pakistan-administered Kashmir. She watched one tear the minaret off the top of the building. But she failed to realise she, too, had been struck - in the chest.When the family reached the relative safety of her aunt's house nearby, someone turned on a phone torch. ""My aunt gasped. There was blood on my frock. It was pink and white but now soaked in red. I hadn't seen it before."" Again they ran. ""I was running but my hand was pressed on my chest the whole time. I didn't want to take it off. I thought if I let go, everything inside me would come out."" A piece of shrapnel was lodged near her heart, she later discovered.A few hours later, in Poonch, Indian-administered Kashmir, a different family was dodging shelling which Pakistan had launched in response to India's missile strikes.""When the firing began, everyone ran for their lives - children clinging to their parents in fear,"" said MN Sudhan, 72. ""Some families managed to leave for Jammu in their vehicles. We also decided to escape. But barely 10 minutes into our journey, a shell landed near our vehicle. The shrapnel tore through the car. My grandson died on the spot.""""Our future was shattered at that [very] moment,"" Mr Sudhan said of 13-year-old Vihaan's death. ""Now we're left with nothing but grief. I have witnessed two wars between India and Pakistan, but never in my life have I seen shelling as intense as this.""Nimra and Vihaan were among many of the villagers caught up in the deadliest attacks for several years in a decades-long conflict between two of the world's nuclear powers - India and Pakistan. Both sides administer the Himalayan region in part but claim it in full. Both governments deny targeting civilians, but BBC journalists in the region have spoken to families caught up in the violence.The strike that injured Nimra was part of India's armed response after a militant attack killed 26 people - mostly Indian tourists - last month at a beauty spot in India-administered Kashmir. Police there claimed militants included at least two Pakistan nationals. Pakistan has asked India for evidence of this, and has called for an independent inquiry into who was behind the attack.What followed was four days of tit-for-tat shelling and drone attacks, intensifying each day and culminating in missile strikes on military bases, which threatened to tip over into full-blown conflict. Then, suddenly, a ceasefire brokered by the US and other international players on 10 May brought the two nuclear powers back from the brink.Families on both sides of the Line of Control (LoC) - the de facto border in Kashmir - told us they had had loved ones killed and property destroyed. At least 16 people are reported to have been killed on the Indian side, while Pakistan claims 40 civilian deaths, though it remains unclear how many were directly caused by the shelling. We also heard from Indian and Pakistani government insiders about the mood in their respective administrations as the conflict escalated.In Delhi's corridors of power, the atmosphere was initially jubilant, an Indian government source told the BBC. Its missile attacks on targets in Pakistan-administered Kashmir and in Pakistan itself - including the Bilal Mosque in Muzaff arabad, which India claims is a militant camp, though Pakistan denies this - were deemed a success.""The strikes… were not limited to Pakistani-administered Kashmir or along the Line of Control,"" an Indian government source told the BBC. ""We went deep - even into the Pakistani side of Punjab, which has always been Pakistan's red line.""But the Pakistani military had been prepared, a source from the Pakistan Air Force told the BBC. Days earlier, the Pakistani government said it was expecting an attack.""We knew something was coming, and we were absolutely ready,"" one officer said, speaking on condition of anonymity. He said Indian fighter jets approached Pakistani territory and the air force was under instructions to shoot down any that crossed into its airspace or dropped a payload.Pakistan claims to have shot down five Indian jets that night, something India has remained silent on.""We were well prepared, and honestly, we were also lucky,"" the source said - his account repeated by two other sources.But Mr Sudhan, Vihaan's grandfather, said there had been no warning to stay indoors or evacuate. ""Why didn't they inform us? We, the people, are caught in the middle.""It is likely that no evacuation orders had been issued because the Indian government needed to keep the military strikes confidential, though the local administration had, following the April militant attack, directed locals to clean out community bunkers as a precautionary measure.A day after the initial missile strikes, Thursday, both sides launched drone attacks, though they each accused the other of making the first move.India began to evacuate thousands of villagers along the Indian side of the LoC. Just after 21:00 that evening, the Khan family in India-administered Kashmir decided they must flee their home in Uri, 270km (168 miles) to the north of Poonch. Most of their neighbours had already left.But after travelling for just 10 minutes, their vehicle was struck by shrapnel from a shell, fatally injuring 47-year-old Nargis. Her sister-in-law Hafeeza was seriously injured. They headed to the nearest hospital, only to find the gates locked.""I somehow climbed the hospital wall and called out for help, telling them we had injured people with us. Only then did the staff come out and open the gate. As soon as they did, I collapsed. The doctors were terrified by the ongoing shelling and had closed everything out of fear,"" Hafeeza said.Hafeeza's sister-in-law Nargis is survived by six children. The youngest daughter Sanam, 20, said the first hospital they went to was not equipped to help, and as they headed to another, her mother died of her injuries.""A piece of shrapnel had torn through her face. My clothes were soaked in her blood… We kept talking to her, urging her to stay with us. But she passed away on the way.""Since a ceasefire agreement between India and Pakistan in 2021 there had been relative peace in the region, locals told the BBC. For the first time in years, they had been able to live normal lives, they said, and now this sense of security was destroyed.Sanam, who lost her mother, said: ""I appeal to both governments - if you're heading into war, at least secure your civilians. Prepare... Those who sit in comfort and demand war - they should be sent to the borders. Let them witness what it really means. Let them lose someone before their eyes.""Sajjad Shafi, the representative for Uri in the regional government, said he had acted as promptly as possible.""The moment I got the news that India has attacked, I got in touch with people and started moving them out.""After two days of attacks and counter attacks, the Indian government source said there was now a ""clear sense in… power corridors that things were escalating but we were ready.""We were ready because India had spent the last 10 years acquiring and building strategic military assets - missiles, warheads and defence systems.""On the international stage, there had been consternation that the tensions would not be de-escalated by the US, despite its diplomatic overtures during India and Pakistan's previous Kashmir clashes.US Vice President JD Vance said a potential war would be ""none of our business"".This statement came as no surprise, the Indian government source told the BBC. At that stage, ""it was clear the US didn't want to get involved"".By the following day, Friday, shelling had become more intense.Muhammed Shafi was at home with his wife in Shahkot village in the Neelum Valley, Pakistan-administered Kashmir, on the LoC.The 30-year-old was standing in the doorway, just a few steps away from where his son was playing; his wife standing in their courtyard.""I remember looking up and seeing a mortar shell coming from a distance. In the blink of an eye, it struck her. She didn't even have time to scream. One second she was there, and the next, she was gone. Her face... her head... there was nothing left. Just a cloud of smoke and dust. My ears went numb. Everything went silent. I didn't even realise I was screaming.""That night, her body lay there, right in our home. The entire village was hiding in bunkers. The shelling continued all night, and I stayed beside her, weeping. I held her hand for as long as I could.""One of those in a bunker was his niece, 18-year-old Umaima. She and her family were holed up in the shelter for four days, on and off, in brutal conditions.""There were six or seven of us packed into it,"" she said. ""The other bunker was already full. There's no place to lie down in there - some people stood, others sat. There was no drinking water, no food,"" with people shouting, crying and reciting prayers in the pitch black.Also in a bunker, in the Leepa Valley, Pakistan-Administered Kashmir - one of the most militarised and vulnerable valleys in the region - was Shams Ur Rehman and family. It is Shams's own bunker, but that night he shared it with 36 other people, he said.Leepa is surrounded on three sides by the LoC and Indian-administered territory, so Shams was used to living with cross-border tensions. But he was not prepared for the complete destruction of his house.He left the bunker at three in the morning to survey the scene.""Everything was gone. Wooden beams and debris from the house were scattered everywhere. The blast was so powerful, the shockwave pushed in the main wall. The metal sheets on the roof were shredded. The entire structure shifted - by at least two inches.""A house is a person's life's work. You're always trying to improve it - but in the end, it's all gone in seconds.""Four hours later, back in the Neelum Valley, Umaima and her family also emerged on Saturday 10 May to a transformed landscape.""We came out of the bunker at seven in the morning. That's when we saw - nothing was left.""As Umaima surveyed the ruins of her village, India and Pakistan's forces that day were trading ever more destructive blows - firing missiles at each other's military installations, which both sides accused the other of instigating.India had targeted three Pakistani air bases, including one in Rawalpindi - the garrison city that houses the Pakistan Army's General Headquarters.""This was a red line crossed,"" said one Pakistani officer. ""The prime minister gave the go-ahead to the army chief. We already had a plan, and our forces were desperately ready to execute it… For anyone in uniform, it was one of those unforgettable days.""Pakistan hit back at Indian military installations. On the diplomatic front, this was seen as a moment to highlight the issue of Kashmir on the international stage, an official in the Pakistan foreign office told the BBC.""It was non-stop. Endless meetings, coordination, and back-to-back calls to and from other countries for both foreign minister and then the prime minister. We welcomed mediation offers from the US, the Saudis, the Iranians, or anyone who could help de-escalate.""On the Indian side, the Pahalgam attack on 22 April had already prompted External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar to speak to at least 17 world leaders or diplomats, including UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. In most of these conversations, he has tweeted, the emphasis had been on the ""cross-border terrorist attack"" and focused on building a case to hold the perpetrators accountable for the attack.Then, on Saturday afternoon local time, in the aftermath of the latest missile exchanges, came a diplomatic breakthrough out of nowhere. US President Donald Trump took to social media to reveal that a ceasefire had been agreed.""After a long night of talks mediated by the United States, I am pleased to announce that India and Pakistan have agreed to a FULL AND IMMEDIATE CEASEFIRE.""Congratulations to both Countries on using Common Sense and Great Intelligence,"" he wrote on social media platform Truth Social.India has since downplayed Washington's role in the ceasefire and it has rejected that trade was used as a lever to achieve this.Behind the scenes, US mediators, diplomatic backchannels and regional players, including the US, the UK and Saudi Arabia, had proved critical in negotiating the climbdown, experts say.""We hit Pakistani strategic bases deep inside their territory and that must have worried the US,"" the Indian government source believes.In Pahalgam, the site of the militant gun attack that sparked the crisis, the search is still on for the perpetrators.Vinay Narwal, a 26-year-old Indian Navy officer, was on his honeymoon in Pahalgam when he was killed. He had got married just a week before the attack.A photo of Vinay's wife Himanshi, sitting near her husband's body following the attack, has been widely shared on social media.His grandfather Hawa Singh Narwal wants ""exemplary punishment"" for the killers.""This terrorism should end. Today, I lost my grandson. Tomorrow, someone else will lose their loved one,"" he said.A witness to the attack's aftermath, Rayees Ahmad Bhat, who used to lead pony treks to the beauty spot where the shootings took place, said his industry was now in ruins.""The attackers may have killed tourists that day, but we - the people of Pahalgam - are dying every day since. They've stained the name of this peaceful town… Pahalgam is terrorised, and its people broken.""The attack was a huge shock for a government which had begun to actively promote tourism in stunningly picturesque Kashmir, famed for its lush valleys, lakes and snow-capped mountains.The source in the Indian administration said this might have lulled Delhi into a false sense of security.""Perhaps we got carried away by the response to tourism in Kashmir. We thought we were over a hump but we were not.""The four-day conflict has once again shown how fragile peace can be between the two nations.Additional reporting by Vikas Pandey in Delhi",Operation Sindoor,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgvr4r5d2qo,BBC,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""framing"", ""reason"": ""The article presents a balanced view of the conflict from both Indian and Pakistani perspectives, but frames India's actions as 'armed response' and 'missile strikes', while Pakistan's actions are described as 'shelling'"", ""confidence"": 0.8}",no,none,no framing
84,How India and Pakistan share one of the world's most dangerous borders,"To live along the Line of Control (LoC) - the volatile de facto border that separates India and Pakistan - is to exist perpetually on the razor's edge between fragile peace and open conflict.The recent escalation after the Pahalgam attack brought India and Pakistan to the brink once again. Shells rained down on both sides of the LoC, turning homes to rubble and lives into statistics. At least 16 people were reportedly killed on the Indian side, while Pakistan claims 40 civilian deaths, though it remains unclear how many were directly caused by the shelling.""Families on the LoC are subjected to Indian and Pakistani whims and face the brunt of heated tensions,"" Anam Zakaria, a Pakistani writer based in Canada, told the BBC.""Each time firing resumes many are thrust into bunkers, livestock and livelihood is lost, infrastructure - homes, hospitals, schools - is damaged. The vulnerability and volatility experienced has grave repercussions for their everyday lived reality,"" Ms Zakaria, author of a book on Pakistan-administered Kashmir, said.India and Pakistan share a 3,323km (2,064-mile) border, including the 740km-long LoC; and the International Border (IB), spanning roughly 2,400km. The LoC began as the Ceasefire Line in 1949 after the first India-Pakistan war, and was renamed under the 1972 Simla Agreement.The LoC cutting through Kashmir - claimed in full and administered in parts by both India and Pakistan - remains one of the most militarised borders in the world. Conflict is never far behind and ceasefires are only as durable as the next provocation.Ceasefire violations here can range from ""low-level firing to major land grabbing to surgical strikes"", says Happymon Jacob, a foreign policy expert at Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU). (A land grab could involve seizing key positions such as hilltops, outposts, or buffer zones by force.)The LoC, many experts say, is a classic example of a ""border drawn in blood, forged through conflict"". It is also a line, as Ms Zakaria says, ""carved by India and Pakistan, and militarised and weaponised, without taking Kashmiris into account"".Such wartime borders aren't unique to South Asia. Sumantra Bose, professor of international and comparative politics at Krea University in India and author of Kashmir at the Crossroads: Inside a 21st-Century Conflict, says the  most well-known is the 'Green Line'  - the ceasefire line of 1949 - which is the generally recognised boundary between Israel and the West Bank.Not surprisingly, the tentative calm along the LoC that had endured since the 2021 ceasefire agreement between the two nuclear-armed neighbours crumbled easily after the latest hostilities.""The current escalation on the LoC and International Border (IB) is significant as it follows a four-year period of relative peace on the border,"" Surya Valliappan Krishna of Carnegie India told the BBC.Violence along the India-Pakistan border is not new - prior to the 2003 ceasefire, India reported 4,134 violations in 2001 and 5,767 in 2002.The 2003 ceasefire initially held, with negligible violations from 2004 to 2007, but tensions resurfaced in 2008 and escalated sharply by 2013.Between 2013 and early 2021, the LoC and the IB witnessed sustained high levels of conflict. A renewed ceasefire in February 2021 led to an immediate and sustained drop in violations through to March 2025.""During periods of intense cross-border firing we've seen border populations in the many thousands be displaced for months on end,"" says Mr Krishna. Between late September and early December 2016, more than 27,000 people were displaced from border areas due to ceasefire violations and cross-border firing.It's looking increasingly hairy and uncertain now.Tensions flared after the Pahalgam attack, with India suspending the key water-sharing treaty between India and Pakistan, known as the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT). Pakistan responded by threatening to exit the 1972 Simla Agreement, which formalised the LoC - though it hasn't followed through yet.""This is significant because the Simla Agreement is the basis of the current LoC, which both sides agreed to not alter unilaterally in spite of their political differences,"" says Mr Krishna.Mr Jacob says for some ""curious reason"", ceasefire violations along the LoC have been absent from discussions and debates about escalation of conflict between the two countries.""It is itself puzzling how the regular use of high-calibre weapons such as 105mm mortars, 130 and 155mm artillery guns and anti-tank guided missiles by two nuclear-capable countries, which has led to civilian and military casualties, has escaped scholarly scrutiny and policy attention,"" Mr Jacob writes in his book, Line On Fire: Ceasefire Violations and India-Pakistan Escalation Dynamics.Mr Jacob identifies two main triggers for the violations: Pakistan often uses cover fire to facilitate militant infiltration into Indian-administered Kashmir, which has witnessed an armed insurgency against Indian rule for over three decades. Pakistan, in turn, accuses India of unprovoked firing on civilian areas.He argues that ceasefire violations along the India-Pakistan border are less the product of high-level political strategy and more the result of local military dynamics.The hostilities are often initiated by field commanders - sometimes with, but often without, central approval. He also challenges the notion that the Pakistan Army alone drives the violations, pointing instead to a complex mix of local military imperatives and autonomy granted to border forces on both sides.Some experts believe It's time to revisit an idea shelved nearly two decades ago: turning the LoC into a formal, internationally recognised border. Others insist that possibility was never realistic - and still isn't.""The idea is completely infeasible, a dead end. For decades, Indian maps have shown the entire territory of the erstwhile princely state of Jammu and Kashmir as part of India,"" Sumantra Bose told the BBC.""For Pakistan, making the LoC part of the International Border would mean settling the Kashmir dispute - which is Pakistan's equivalent of the Holy Grail - on India's preferred terms. Every Pakistani government and leader, civilian or military, over the past seven decades has rejected this.""In his 2003 book, Kashmir: Roots of Conflict, Paths to Peace, Prof Bose writes: ""A Kashmir settlement necessitates that the LoC be transformed - from an iron curtain of barbed wire, bunkers, trenches and hostile militaries to a linen curtain. Realpolitik dictates that the border will be permanent (albeit probably under a different name), but it must be transcended without being abolished.""""I stressed, though, that such a transformation of the LoC must be embedded in a broader Kashmir settlement, as one pillar of a multi-pillared settlement,"" he told the BBC.Between 2004 and 2007, turning the LoC into a soft border was central to a fledgling India-Pakistan peace process on Kashmir - a process that ultimately fell apart.Today, the border has reignited, bringing back the cycle of violence and uncertainty for those who live in its shadow.""You never know what will happen next. No one wants to sleep facing the Line of Control tonight,"" an employee of a hotel in Pakistan-administered Kashmir told BBC Urdu during the recent hostilities.It was a quiet reminder of how fragile peace is when your window opens to a battlefield.",Operation Sindoor,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgmj7l0lne3o,BBC,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""framing"", ""reason"": ""The article frames the conflict between India and Pakistan as a perpetual and intractable problem, emphasizing the 'fragile peace' and 'open conflict' along the LoC.

85,India says it killed militants who shot dead tourists in Kashmir,"India has said its security forces killed three militants who shot dead 26 civilians near a tourist town in Indian-administered Kashmir in April, triggering a brief military conflict with Pakistan.Home Minister Amit Shah told parliament the men had been killed by Indian forces near the disputed region's main city Srinagar on Monday.He claimed the attackers were Pakistani nationals, a charge Islamabad denies. The men's identity was confirmed through forensic and ballistic tests, Shah told MPs.Pakistan has not commented on the claims, which have not been independently confirmed and come amid mounting criticism of India's government for alleged security lapses in Kashmir.Twenty-six men, mostly Hindu tourists, were killed by gunmen who opened fire at a mountain meadow not far from the scenic town of Pahalgam on 22 April, in one of the deadliest attacks in the region in recent years.The victims were killed in cold blood in front of their wives and family members. A local Muslim pony handler who tried to help them was also shot dead.Delhi accused Islamabad of supporting militant groups involved in the attack - a charge Pakistan has repeatedly denied. In May, India launched a series of strikes on sites in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir.Pakistan responded with drones, missiles and fighter jets, leading to four days of intense military action from both sides.Dozens of people were killed in the bloodiest confrontation between India and Pakistan in decades, before US President Donald Trump announced a ceasefire between them.India's opposition leaders have accused the government of ""severe security lapses"" and have been questioning why it has taken this much time to catch the attackers.In parliament on Monday, Congress MP Gaurav Gogoi demanded that Shah should personally take responsibility for the attack.""The country wants to know why the government has not been able to nab the terrorists even after 100 days since the attack,"" he said.Shah responded on Tuesday, saying that security forces had ""neutralised the three terrorists"" involved in the attack in a mission called ""Operation Mahadev"".The three died in a gun battle in a wildlife reserve in the mountains of Dachigam, about 30km (18 miles) from Srinagar, the Indian army said on Monday. The clash could not be independently confirmed by the BBC. The army did not immediately identify those it killed.But on Tuesday, Shah claimed the men - who he identified as Suleiman Shah, Afghan and Jibran - were Pakistani nationals.""When the terrorists were killed [on Monday], we recovered three rifles - one M9 American rifle and two AK-47s. The cartridges we had collected were also from an M9 and AK-47. We sent the rifles last night to the central forensics lab in Chandigarh where they fired them, and these were then compared and it was confirmed these were the three rifles used in the attack to kill our innocent citizens,"" Shah said.""I have the ballistic report,"" he told the house, holding up some papers. ""Six scientists have cross verified it. They told me this morning on a video call these are 100% the bullets that they had fired.""At the beginning of the investigation in May, Indian police had issued sketches of three men, saying two were Pakistanis while one was a local man.But in June, Indian investigators said all three militants were Pakistani nationals from the UN-proscribed militant group Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) after it arrested two locals for allegedly sheltering the suspected militants prior to the attack.However, on Tuesday, Shah clarified that only two men - Suleiman Shah and Afghan - were believed to be LeT members. He did not say which group the Indian authorities thought the third militant Jibran was associated with.The militants were identified by locals who had provided them shelter, he claimed.""We have voter ID numbers of the two of them, we have weapons recovered from them. The chocolates recovered from them are also made in Pakistan,"" Shah said.""They killed our tourists and now they have been killed.""Shah also defended the speed of the investigation amid questions on how the three men had managed to remain undetected over the past three months.""Right after the attack, we handed over the investigation to the National Investigation Agency (NIA),"" he said.""We made all arrangements with the security and border forces to ensure they [culprits] couldn't leave the country.""Some opposition leaders, however, remained unconvinced and questioned the lack of security in Pahalgam on the day of the attack.""Why was not even one security personnel present there?""

86,India denies it was pressured into ending conflict with Pakistan,"India's defence ministry has rejected US President Donald Trump's claim of ending its conflict with Pakistan in May, saying the country had not responded to pressure from anyone.Rajnath Singh was speaking at the opening of a parliamentary debate on the 22 April attack in Pahalgam, in Indian-administered Kashmir, which claimed the lives of 26 tourists.India blamed Pakistan for the attack - which it denied - and launched a series of strikes, named ""Operation Sindoor"", on its neighbour, leading to four days of intense military action from both sides.Trump has frequently claimed that the ceasefire between the two nuclear-armed neighbours was brokered by the US - which India has denied.On Monday, Singh reiterated that it was ""completely incorrect and baseless to say that the military action was stopped because of pressure"".""India halted its operation because all the political and military objectives studied before and during the conflict had been fully achieved,"" he told the Lok Sabha, the lower house of parliament.He also claimed the decision was taken after a request from Pakistan's Director General of Military Operations (DGMO), who ""pleaded for relief"".""It was only after this that the Indian Armed Forces decided to pause operations,"" he added. Islamabad has not commented on Singh's claims.The escalation in May was the worst military confrontation between India and Pakistan in decades, with dozens of people killed in the four-day fighting, before Trump announced a ceasefire between them.Singh said the purpose of India's military action was ""to destroy the terror nurseries raised by Pakistan over the years"".He said over 100 ""terrorists, their trainers, handlers and associates"" were killed in coordinated strikes on nine ""terror infrastructure targets"" in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered-Kashmir in an operation that lasted 22 minutes.""The objective was to provide justice to the families who lost their loved ones in the Pahalgam terror attack,"" he said.During the proceedings, opposition leaders questioned the government about Islamabad's claim that it shot down five Indian fighter jets and a drone during the conflict.Singh denied this and said India's defence systems had intercepted all incoming projectiles and missiles, adding that no Indian military establishment suffered any damage.He also said the Indian armed forces could resume military action if there was any further ""misadventure"" from the Pakistan side.Earlier in the day, the Indian army said that it had killed ""three terrorists"" in a gun battle in Indian-administered Kashmir.Indian TV channels claimed the three were suspected to be behind the April attack - but officials have not confirmed this.Indian investigators have previously said all three militants involved in the deadly attack were Pakistani nationals from the UN-proscribed militant group Lashkar-e-TaibaFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook.",Operation Sindoor,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y204pmrp2o,BBC,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""source"", ""reason"": ""The article relies on Indian Defence Ministry's rejection of Trump's claim without providing a direct quote from Pakistan's side, indicating a preference for Indian sources."", ""confidence"": 0.8}",no,none,no source bias
87,The beauty and brutality of life in the shadow of Kashmir killings,"A centuries-old Persian couplet often repeated in Indian-administered Kashmir translates to: ""If there is a paradise on earth, it is here, it is here, it is here."" And many Kashmiris insist it was written with Pahalgam in mind.The small town, nestled between tall Himalayan mountains with a gurgling Lidder River flowing through it, is called the mini-Switzerland of India.The valleys and meadows here have long provided stunning locations for Bollywood romances and attracted tens of thousands of tourists escaping the heat and dust of Indian plains.But on 22 April, the tranquil valley hit global headlines when a sprawling meadow here turned into killing fields.Militants singled out male Hindu tourists and murdered 25 of them in front of their families in Baisaran, a beauty spot about 7km from the town. A local Muslim pony handler who tried to help tourists was also shot dead.The massacre brought nuclear-armed India and Pakistan to the brink of war. India blamed Pakistan for the killings – an accusation Islamabad denied – and the two countries attacked each other with missiles and drones over four days in May after which a fragile truce was agreed.But in Pahalgam, time seems to have slowed down and the residents are trying to pick up the pieces and move on.When I recently visited Pahalgam, where a large majority makes a living through tourism, I found a land and its people trying to deal with the collective trauma, mourning the loss of lives - and livelihoods. The peak tourist season here is April to June - and this year, most of it has already been lost.""What happened here is condemnable… an inhuman act. Innocent people were killed,"" says Javeed Burza, president of Pahalgam Hotels and Restaurants association.Standing in the rear lawns of his hotel, he watches the Lidder roar past. On the other side are huge mountains covered by a thick carpet of trees. It's this sort of view that made this valley in south Kashmir such a sought-after destination.Mr Burza says visitors came from all over India for its lakes, forests, meadows and glaciers – and went back raving about the local people and their hospitality.""People here are poor, they live hand-to-mouth, but they are known to be very kind and helpful. Now we are all facing the consequences of this senseless violence,"" he adds. ""We had bookings right until the end of June. But then everything fell apart like a pack of cards. There's not much left here now.""The region's Chief Minister Omar Abdullah says in the immediate aftermath of the attack, tourists fled the town and people who were proposing to come cancelled.To persuade tourists to give Pahalgam another chance, he visited the town within weeks of the attack, held a cabinet meeting there and, ignoring advice of security officials, cycled through the streets.For Mr Abdullah, Pahalgam's wellbeing is personal.""It's where our school picnics were; it's where we probably first dipped our toes in running water. For some of us it's the first time we went white water rafting or trout fishing. For others, it's a day or overnight visit. For us, it's part of our growing up.""Mr Abdullah says it's always hard to make predictions but he hopes to see Pahalgam ""where it was on 21 April this year"".On that day, it was packed with tourists, says Fayyaz Ahmad, who sells Kashmiri embroidered shawls and dresses in Pahalgam's main market, with shops lining both sides of the only road that passes through the town.Many remain shuttered, but a few have begun to open in the hope of attracting customers. The day I met him was the first he'd opened his shop since the killings.The last three seasons – post-Covid years – had been marked by bumper visits, Mr Ahmad says.""Every morning at least 3,000 cars would arrive by 11am. There would be traffic jams lasting two-three hours. Many tourists would say they couldn't find accommodation.""His own shop sometimes got so crowded that a queue of shoppers would form outside. ""Business was brisk,"" he said. But now he's had to let three salesmen go. They would be rehired only if business picked up, he said.The targeting of tourists has left him bewildered. Since 1989, when an anti-India militancy gripped Kashmir valley, Mr Ahmad says, ""the situation was really bad here"".""We were afraid to step out of our homes, but tourists who chose to come here were never harmed. We can't understand why they've been targeted now. Who could do such a thing?"" he asks.India blamed Pakistan-backed militants for the massacre in a region that both countries claim in full, but control only in parts.Delhi accuses its neighbour of fuelling a long-running insurgency that has killed tens of thousands in Indian-administered Kashmir. Islamabad has long denied backing militants there.In recent years, the insurgency had abated, bringing millions of tourists and a growing sense that the region was finally becoming safer. But that has now changed.""Pahalgam ke naam par dhabba lag gaya [Pahalgam's name is stained],"" laments Nisar Ali, an 80-year-old resident who makes a living by selling papier mache products.""People had taken loans to open shops and buy taxis, now everyone is staring at an uncertain future. What's happened to our paradise,"" he asks.Just 2km from the market, a signboard points to the untarred road that goes up to Baisaran, a 5km trek covered on foot or ponies. The concertina wire used to barricade the road has been moved to one side and local people and flocks of sheep can be seen making their way down.Before the killings, it was one of the most popular places for tourists. The meadow offering a great view of the valley was open from 08:00 to 17:00 and would get thousands of visitors daily in the summer.But it remains out of bounds now. Two men have been arrested for allegedly providing shelter to the militants, but those who carried out the killings have still not been caught - leading to fears that they could return.Abdul Wahid Wani, the president of Pahalgam pony owners' union, who was the first to arrive at the scene, says 1,090 tourists had gone up to the meadow until 14:00.At the time of the attack, there were about 300 tourists in Baisaran, he estimates.At 14:36, he says, he received a call from the police asking him if he had heard anything about an incident at Baisaran.""I tried calling colleagues who had taken tourists up to the meadow, but no-one answered. I figured something was wrong and my brother and I ran all the way up and reached there at 15:10.""The police and paramilitaries arrived 15 minutes later. That night, Mr Wani, wrapped up at 02:30. He says what he saw there keeps him awake at nights.""I saw women and children crying and screaming. I saw bodies on the ground. I saw 10-15 people injured.""In the first videos of the aftermath that went viral on the day of the attack, Mr Wani can be heard trying to reassure the survivors, offering them water, telling them he was there to help.He summoned other pony handlers who arrived at the scene to help evacuate people - ""carrying them down on our backs and wooden cots"" - and gather bodies strewn about the vast field.""I still can't forget what I saw that day. I panicked; I had palpitations. I'd never seen anything like that before.""When I met him in Pahalgam, he looked tired, his eyes sunk deep into his lined face.""For many nights I couldn't sleep and sleep still eludes me. With the militants still on the loose, I worry what will happen if they come after us because we helped people they were trying to kill?""But earlier this week, we exchanged messages and he sounded more optimistic.The town has sprung back to life, with thousands of pilgrims arriving to take part in Amarnath Yatra - the annual Hindu pilgrimage to the Amarnath cave shrine. It began on 3 July and will go on until 9 August.Dozens of camps have been set up and thousands of police and security forces have been deployed along the route to ensure security.Pahalgam is one of the two starting points for the trek to the shrine – and as many pilgrims hire ponies to take them part of the way, there's a steady stream of work for Mr Wani and his colleagues.But hoteliers and shop-owners say they will have to wait for their turn until after the end of the pilgrimage since most pilgrims stay in cheaper camps and rarely purchase crafts.But many are taking heart from the fact that tourists have begun returning to the region. Ravi Gosain, president of All India Tour Operators, says in June, 40% of more than 45,000 tourists who visited the Kashmir Valley went to Pahalgam.On the day I visited, there were families stopping for photographs under a ""Love Pahalgam"" sign.Shabiba and Hamid Jaffar, who had visited last year around the same time, said it was so crowded then that they had to wait for half an hour to be able to take a photo here.""When we decided to come this year, our friends tried to discourage us saying it's not safe,"" says Shabiba. ""But it's totally safe and my children are so happy that they are saying let's move to Kashmir.""Mr Jaffar says their friends are calling them after seeing their photos. ""And I'm telling them to come here for a holiday. Where will you see this beauty? Where will you get this peace?""",Operation Sindoor,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjrll874eg5o,BBC,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""framing"", ""reason"": ""The article frames the event as a brutal attack on innocent tourists and locals by militants, while also highlighting the beauty of Pahalgam.

88,Indian investigators now claim all Pahalgam attackers were Pakistan nationals,"Indian investigators say all three militants involved in April's deadly attack on tourists near Indian-administered Kashmir's Pahalgam town were Pakistani nationals from the UN-proscribed militant group Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT).Police had earlier issued sketches of three men saying two were Pakistanis while one was a local man.The claim by the National Investigative Agency (NIA) came after it arrested two local men for allegedly sheltering the attackers. Pakistan has not commented on these claims.It had earlier rejected involvement in the attacks in which 26 people were killed. The attack in Baisaran, a popular tourist spot, had brought  India and Pakistan on the brink of war.The nuclear-armed South Asian neighbours, who have fought three wars over Kashmir, claim the region in full but administer it in parts.The killings on 22 April had sent shockwaves through India and the case was handed over to NIA, a federal investigative agency.Security forces had launched a major search and combing operation in the region and thousands were detained across Kashmir for questioning.The three attackers are, however, yet to be caught.In a statement on Sunday, NIA said the arrested men had ""knowingly harboured the three armed terrorists at a seasonal dhol (hut)"" before the 22 April attack. It did not give details of when the arrests took place and as those arrested are in custody, they have not made any statement.A little-known group, The Resistance Front (TRF), allied with the Lashkar-e-Taiba, had initially said it was behind the attack but later disowned it.Within days of the attack, India revoked the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty, a long-standing water-sharing agreement with Pakistan. Islamabad, in turn, withdrew from the 1972 Simla agreement that sought to settle differences through bilateral negotiations and peaceful means.India followed it by launching air and missile attacks on 7 May, targeting sites it called ""terror infrastructure in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir"".Pakistan denied the claim that these were terror camps and also responded by firing missiles and deploying drones into Indian territory.The hostilities between the two countries continued until 10 May when US President Donald Trump announced a ceasefire.Follow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook",Operation Sindoor,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c36xe95g06zo,BBC,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""source"", ""reason"": ""The article relies on Indian investigators' claims without providing a direct quote or statement from Pakistan's side, despite mentioning that Pakistan has not commented on these claims."", ""confidence"": 0.8}",no,none,no source bias
89,'Tourists are our lifeline': Picking up the pieces in Kashmir after April killings,"Two months after a deadly attack in Indian-administered Kashmir scared away tourists and brought India and Pakistan to the brink of war, the picturesque valley nestled in the Himalayan mountains is beginning to see the first signs of a tourism revival.Shabana Awwal is making videos of her children as they take turns to get on a water bike for a ride on the Dal Lake, Srinagar city's most iconic tourist spot.Ms Awwal has travelled from the western state of Rajasthan with her husband and children in a group of 15 - all members of their extended family.""I've visited Kashmir many times and seen all the major attractions such as Gulmarg, Sonmarg and Pahalgam and wanted to show all these places to my relatives,"" she tells the BBC.The Awwals had planned their 10-day trip in March. ""Summer in Rajasthan is unbearably hot so we'd planned to escape to Kashmir during the children's school vacation,"" she says.But since she planned the trip, the circumstances here have drastically changed. On 22 April, militants attacked tourists visiting a beauty spot near Pahalgam town, killing 26 men.Tourism is the mainstay of the economy of Jammu and Kashmir, a federally-administered territory, and this unprecedented targeting of tourists sent shockwaves through India. The authorities closed down 48 tourist destinations in the valley and two-thirds of them still remain shut.Chief Minister Omar Abdullah, who's been lobbying hard to reopen these spots to attract visitors to the region, says ""the impact of the attack was immediate and very widely felt"".""There was a mass exodus of those tourists who were already here, and a mass cancellation of those who were proposing to come. Then India and Pakistan, for all intents and purposes, were almost at war for a couple of days in May,"" Abdullah told the BBC.""So the lasting impact has been felt both in the deterioration of relations between the two neighbouring countries and our tourism season for the year is going to be, what word do I use for it? I guess you can call it a disaster.""Kashmir, claimed by both India and Pakistan, has been a flashpoint for decades. The nuclear-armed South Asian neighbours have fought two wars and a limited conflict over Kashmir. For more than a quarter of a century, the region has seen an armed insurgency against Indian rule, but even at its peak, tourists were rarely targeted.Ms Awwal said her family decided to continue with their holiday because ""we weren't really afraid"" and ""we thought we'll deal with whatever came our way"".""We are happy that we went ahead with our plans. The situation here is normal,"" she says and blames the ""media hype"" for the impression that it's unsafe to travel to Kashmir.The Awwals are not alone in their optimism. Deepti and Anuj Gandhi of Jammu who made their plans just last week say ""there's no summer holiday destination better than Kashmir"".""The children love to ride water bikes and then we'll go boating in the lake. We come here every year, so why break the tradition now?"" she says.Earlier this week, news agency ANI reported that a group of Polish tourists had arrived in the city.The arrivals merely weeks after the Pahalgam attack are a cause of optimism for hoteliers, taxi drivers, tour guides, shopkeepers and owners of shikaras – the Venetian gondola-like narrow colourful wooden boats that ferry tourists on the Dal Lake.In April, president of the shikara owners' association Haji Wali Mohammad Bhat says, the Dal Lake boulevard was packed with thousands of tourists, there were daily traffic jams and many complained they were finding it hard to get accommodation.""The attack on tourists was unfortunate and tragic,"" he says.""It has affected all of us and our livelihoods. Tourists are our life, tourism is our lifeline. God knows what sin we're paying for,"" he adds, despairingly.Ravi Gosain, president of Indian Association of Tour Operators, who recently led a three-day ""fact-finding trip"" of tour operators - as ""they are the ones who send travellers to Kashmir"" says ""for the past few years tourism was flourishing in Kashmir, lots of new hotels had been built, new vehicles were bought and new shops had opened"".Last year, the government said 23.6 million tourists visited Jammu and Kashmir, with 3.49 million visiting the valley.This year, Mr Gosain says, the peak season has been lost in the valley, but tourism can still pick up.""Locals are very welcoming, hoteliers, tour guides and shopkeepers are very friendly and people are coming back. You can see it – all flights are coming in full, tourism is bouncing back quickly.""I think the national sentiment is that if the purpose of the attack was to derail tourism, then it won't succeed. But I hope no untoward incident happens again,"" he adds.According to reports, some of the credit for the revival of tourism in Kashmir also goes to a new train link that has for the first time connected Srinagar with the rest of India.The twice-daily train from Srinagar to Katra station, in Jammu region – which recently made headlines for passing over ""the world's highest single-arch railway bridge"" – has been running packed and tickets have been sold out for the next two months.Katra, which is the starting point for those visiting the popular Hindu shrine of Vaishno Devi, attracted 9.48 million pilgrims last year.And many of those arriving there since 7 June, when the spanking new air-conditioned train was commissioned, have been hopping on it to go to Kashmir.Among the pilgrims taking advantage of the easy connectivity is Ghanshyam Bharadwaj and his wife Mamata Sharma and their children. For the Delhi-based couple enjoying hot sugary tea near the Dal Lake, coming to Srinagar was ""a spur of the moment decision"".""It took us just three hours from Katra. We'll spend the night here and take the train back to Katra tomorrow and travel on to Delhi,"" Mr Bharadwaj said.""I ask him if he was worried travelling to the valley so soon after the Pahalgam attack?""There's nothing to be afraid of. This is my country,"" he says.Chief Minister Abdullah says the fact that the pilgrims are choosing to come to the valley is a good start.""Now those who are coming for a few hours, I'd like to see them come for a few days. Those who are coming for a few days, I'd like to see them having the confidence to stay for a week.""But at least it's a beginning, and that's what helps.""Follow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.",Operation Sindoor,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly8lx75d6ro,BBC,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""tonality"", ""reason"": ""The article's tone is generally optimistic and reassuring about the safety of tourism in Kashmir, with quotes from locals and tourists downplaying the impact of the attack.

90,"An Indian teacher was killed - then he got falsely labelled a ""terrorist""","Farooq Ahmed still bristles with anger when he talks about his brother's death.Mohammad Iqbal, a resident of Poonch city in Indian-administered Kashmir, died in cross-border shelling on 7 May, the morning after India launched a series of air strikes in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir in retaliation to a militant attack in the town of Pahalgam that killed 26 people. Pakistan has denied having any role in the attack.Mr Ahmed says that Iqbal died where he had worked for more than two decades - Zia-ul-Uloom, a madrassa, or a religious centre focused on Islamic teachings, in Poonch.But his death, it turned out, was just the beginning of the family's troubles.As the news spread, several media channels falsely accused Iqbal of being a terrorist, following which the police put out a statement refuting the claim.""My brother was a teacher but they saw his beard and skullcap and branded him a terrorist,"" Mr Ahmed says.""It was like having salt rubbed into our wounds. We had lost Iqbal and then the media defamed him. The dead can't defend themselves.""Indian officials say that a total of 16 people, including Iqbal, were killed in the cross-border shelling during the four-day military conflict that broke out between India and Pakistan following the airstrikes.Pakistan has claimed 40 civilian deaths, though, it remains unclear how many of these were directly caused by the shelling.The two nuclear-armed countries have shared a tense relationship for decades, as both administer the Himalayan region of Kashmir in part, but claim it in full.They have fought three wars over Kashmir since independence from Britain in 1947 and came back from the brink of another one earlier this month.But as the military conflict escalated, another battle played out on social media - a disinformation war of claims and counterclaims that circulated online and on TV.Just like rumours about Iqbal's identity, other misleading and inaccurate information also found its way into some mainstream news channels and websites.This included claims such as India having destroyed Pakistan's Karachi port, which was later debunked by the Indian government.Some of the other fabrications were harder to spot, like an AI-generated video of a Pakistan army general claiming that his country had lost two aircraft in combat.""The scale of misinformation and fact-free assertions being broadcast by the media was shocking,"" says Manisha Pande, managing editor at Newslaundry, an independent news platform.She notes that while a degree of sensationalism is expected as channels compete for viewership, ""the jingoistic and irresponsible coverage"" of the conflict was unprecedented in its intensity — and unlike anything she had witnessed before.No one knows this better than Mr Ahmed.""I don't know where news channels got the information about my brother from,"" Mr Ahmed says.""Who did they speak to? What kind of evidence did they have that my brother was a terrorist?"" he asks.Weeks later, the family is still reeling from the tragedy.Mr Ahmed says that on 7 May, his brother left home for the madrassa in the morning as usual, but it was his body that returned home. By noon, they had buried him in a nearby cemetery.For some time, the family had no idea about the misinformation that was being shared by some news outlets. They were busy performing Iqbal's last rites.It was only hours later that a relative received a WhatsApp forward - a video clip of a prominent news channel claiming that the Indian army had killed a terrorist, with Iqbal's photo flashing on the screen.""We were shocked. Soon, we began getting more calls from people asking us what was going on and why was the media calling Iqbal a terrorist,"" Mr Ahmed says.The claim was shared by some prominent channels, including Zee News, ABP and News18. The BBC has reached out to the channels for comment.One channel claimed that Iqbal was killed in an ""Indian strike on a terrorist camp"" in Pakistan-administered Kashmir, and that he was a terrorist with Pakistan-based terror group Lashkar-e-Taiba.""Our family members have been staying in Poonch for generations. How can they say my brother was living in Pakistan? They [the media] should be ashamed,"" Mr Ahmed says.The accusation against Iqbal was circulated so widely and swiftly that on 8 May, the Poonch police put out a statement, clarifying that Iqbal had died in cross-border shelling in the madrasa.""Poonch Police strongly refutes such false narratives. The deceased, Maulana Mohd Iqbal, was a respected religious figure in the local community and had no affiliation with any terror outfit,"" the statement said, adding that legal action would be taken against any media outlet or individual who circulated the fake news.But for Mr Ahmed, the statement was too little too late.""By then, the false claim would've already reached millions of people in India,"" he says.He adds that except for one channel, News18, no one else had publicly apologised to him or their viewers for the mistake.Mr Ahmed says he wants to take legal action against the channels, but the process would have to wait as the family is struggling to make ends meet.Iqbal is survived by his two wives and eight children. He was the only earning member in his family.Mr Ahmed says that the compensation given by the government, which amounts to a few million rupees, will last only for a year or two and they must start planning for the future now.""The whole family depended on my brother. He was a quiet and gentle man who loved teaching children,"" Mr Ahmed says.""But who's going to tell this to the world? For many people, my brother is still a terrorist whose killing is justified.

91,Is China the winner in the India-Pakistan conflict?,"The four-day conflict between arch-rivals India and Pakistan this month ended with a ceasefire and both claiming victory – but it now appears that China's defence industry might also be an unlikely winner.The latest flare-up began on 7 May when India launched attacks on what it called ""terrorist infrastructure"" inside Pakistan in response to the brutal killing of 26 people, mostly tourists by militants in Pahalgam on 22 April.Many of them were killed in the scenic valley in Indian-administered Kashmir in front of their wives and family members. Delhi accused Islamabad of supporting militant groups involved in the carnage, a charge Pakistan denied.After India's response - which it called Operation Sindoor - to the militant attack, tit-for-tat military manoeuvres from both sides followed, involving drones, missiles and fighter jets.India reportedly used its French and Russian-made jets, while Pakistan deployed its J-10 and J-17 aircraft, which Islamabad co-produces with Beijing. Both sides say their jets did not cross the border and they were firing missiles at each other from a distance.Islamabad claims that its fighter aircraft shot down at least six Indian planes, including the newly-acquired French-made Rafale fighter jets. Delhi hasn't responded to these claims.""Losses are a part of combat,"" Air Marshal AK Bharti of the Indian Air Force (IAF) said last week when a reporter asked him about these claims. Air Marshal Bharti declined to comment on the specific claim of Pakistan downing Indian jets.""We have achieved the objectives that we selected, and all our pilots are back home,"" he added.India said it had killed at least ""100 terrorists"" while targeting the headquarters of the banned Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed militant outfits based in Pakistan.A definitive account of what really happened in the aerial battle is yet to emerge. Some media outlets reported plane crashes in the state of Punjab and Indian-administered Kashmir around the same time but the Indian government has not responded to the reports.A Reuters report quoting American officials said Pakistan possibly had used the Chinese-made J-10 aircraft to launch air-to-air missiles against Indian fighter jets. Pakistan claiming victory after hugely relying on Chinese weapons systems in an active combat situation is being seen by some experts as a boost for Beijing's defence industry but some also disagree with the claim.Some of the experts have called this a ""DeepSeek moment"" for the Chinese weapons industry, referring to January this year when the Chinese AI start-up shook US giants with its cost-effective technology.""The aerial fight was a big advertisement for the Chinese weapons industry. Until now, China had no opportunity to test its platforms in a combat situation,"" Zhou Bo, a retired senior colonel in the Chinese People's Liberation Army, told the BBC.The Beijing-based analyst said the outcome of the air duel showed ""China has some systems that are next to none"". Shares in the Chinese Avic Chengdu Aircraft company, that manufactures fighter jets like the J-10, surged by up to 40% last week after the reported performance of the fighter jet in the India-Pakistan conflict.Other experts, however, feel it's too early to declare the superiority of Chinese weapons systems.Professor Walter Ladwig from the King's College in London said it was yet to be determined whether the Chinese jets had actually outmanoeuvred the Indian Air Force (IAF) planes, particularly the Rafale.""In a standard military doctrine, you would suppress the enemy's air defences and get air superiority before you struck ground targets. Instead, it appears the IAF's mission was clearly not to provoke any Pakistani military retaliation,"" he said.Mr Ladwig thought that the Indian pilots were given instructions to fly despite the fact that the entire Pakistani air defence was on high alert and their jets were already in the sky. The IAF hasn't given details of the mission or about its air operations strategy.Beijing also hasn't made any comment on reports of the J-10 taking down Indian fighter jets, including the Rafale. But unconfirmed reports of the J-10 bringing down a Western weapon system has triggered jubilation and triumphalism on Chinese social media.Carlotta Rinaudo, a China researcher at the International Team for the Study of Security in Verona, said Chinese social media was flooded with nationalistic messages even though it's difficult to reach a conclusion with the available information.""At the moment perception matters way more than reality. If we see it in that way, the main winner is really China,"" she said.For China, Pakistan is a strategic and economic ally. It is investing more than $50bn (£37bn) to build infrastructure in Pakistan as part of its China-Pakistan Economic corridor.So, a weak Pakistan is not in China's interest.China made a critical difference in the latest India-Pakistan conflict, says Imtiaz Gul, a Pakistani security analyst. ""It took the Indian planners by sheer surprise. They didn't probably envision the depth of co-operation in the modern warfare between Pakistan and China,"" he said.Experts say the performance of the Chinese jets in a real combat situation was keenly analysed in Western capitals as this will have cascading impact on global arms trade. The US is the world's largest arms exporter, while China is the fourth.China sells weapons mostly to developing countries like Myanmar and Pakistan. Previously the Chinese weapon systems were criticised for their poor quality and technical problems.Reports said the Burmese military grounded several of its JF-17 fighter jets – jointly manufactured by China and Pakistan in 2022 – due to technical malfunctions.The Nigerian military reported several technical problems with the Chinese made F-7 fighter jets.Another point to be noted is that this was not the first time that India lost an aircraft to Pakistan.In 2019, during a brief air battle between the two sides following similar Indian air strikes on suspected terrorist targets in Pakistan, a Russian-made MiG-21 jet was shot down inside Pakistani territory and the pilot was captured. He was released a few days later.India, however, said that the pilot had ejected after successfully shooting down Pakistani fighter jets, including a US-made F-16. Pakistan has denied the claim.Despite reports of the downing of Indian jets last week, experts like Mr Ladwig argue that India was able to hit an ""impressive breadth of targets"" inside Pakistan early in the morning of 10 May and this fact has gone largely unnoticed by the international media.The Indian military said in a co-ordinated attack, it launched missiles on 11 Pakistani air bases across the country, including the strategic Nur Khan air base outside Rawalpindi, not far from the Pakistani military headquarters. It's a sensitive target that took Islamabad by surprise.One of the furthest targets was in Bholari, 140km (86 miles) from the southern city of Karachi.Mr Ladwig says this time the IAF operated with standard procedures - first attacking Pakistani air defence and radar systems and then focusing on ground targets.The Indian jets used an array of missiles, loitering munitions and drones despite the Pakistanis operating the Chinese-provided HQ 9 air defence system.""It seems the attacks were relatively precise and targeted. The craters were in the middle of runways, exactly the ideal spot. If it were a longer conflict, how long would it take the Pakistani Air Force to get these facilities up and running again, I can't say,"" Mr Ladwig pointed out.Nevertheless, he said, by refusing to get into the details of the mission briefing, India's military ""lost control of the narrative thread"".In response to the Indian strikes, Pakistan said it launched missile and air strikes on several Indian forward air bases, but Delhi said the attacks caused no damage to equipment and personnel.Realising that the situation was getting out of control, the US and its allies intervened and put pressure on both countries to stop the fighting.But for India, experts say, the whole episode is a wake-up call.Beijing may not comment on the details of the recent India-Pakistan conflict, but it's keen to show that its weapon systems are fast catching up with the West.Delhi is aware that the jets China has supplied to Pakistan are some of the earlier models. Beijing has already inducted the more advanced J-20 stealth fighter jets, that can evade radars.India and China have a long-standing border dispute along the Himalayas and fought a brief border war in 1962 that resulted in a defeat for India. A brief border clash took place in Ladakh in June 2020.Experts say India is acutely aware that it needs to accelerate investments in its homegrown defence manufacturing industry and speed up international buying.For now, China's defence industry seems to be enjoying the limelight following the claims of success of one of its aircraft in the India-Pakistan conflict.Follow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook",Operation Sindoor,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1w3dln352vo,BBC,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""framing"", ""reason"": ""The article frames the conflict as a 'win' for China's defence industry, highlighting its success in a real combat situation and implying that it has surpassed Western weapon systems."", ""confidence"": 0.8}",yes,framing,frames chinas advantage as Indias Loss
92,Relief in Kashmir - but BBC hears from families on both sides mourning the dead,"Sixteen-year-old Nimra stood outside, rooted to the spot, as the Indian missiles that had woken her a moment ago rained down on the mosque a few metres from her house in Pakistan-administered Kashmir. She watched one tear the minaret off the top of the building. But she failed to realise she, too, had been struck - in the chest.When the family reached the relative safety of her aunt's house nearby, someone turned on a phone torch. ""My aunt gasped. There was blood on my frock. It was pink and white but now soaked in red. I hadn't seen it before."" Again they ran. ""I was running but my hand was pressed on my chest the whole time. I didn't want to take it off. I thought if I let go, everything inside me would come out."" A piece of shrapnel was lodged near her heart, she later discovered.A few hours later, in Poonch, Indian-administered Kashmir, a different family was dodging shelling which Pakistan had launched in response to India's missile strikes.""When the firing began, everyone ran for their lives - children clinging to their parents in fear,"" said MN Sudhan, 72. ""Some families managed to leave for Jammu in their vehicles. We also decided to escape. But barely 10 minutes into our journey, a shell landed near our vehicle. The shrapnel tore through the car. My grandson died on the spot.""""Our future was shattered at that [very] moment,"" Mr Sudhan said of 13-year-old Vihaan's death. ""Now we're left with nothing but grief. I have witnessed two wars between India and Pakistan, but never in my life have I seen shelling as intense as this.""Nimra and Vihaan were among many of the villagers caught up in the deadliest attacks for several years in a decades-long conflict between two of the world's nuclear powers - India and Pakistan. Both sides administer the Himalayan region in part but claim it in full. Both governments deny targeting civilians, but BBC journalists in the region have spoken to families caught up in the violence.The strike that injured Nimra was part of India's armed response after a militant attack killed 26 people - mostly Indian tourists - last month at a beauty spot in India-administered Kashmir. Police there claimed militants included at least two Pakistan nationals. Pakistan has asked India for evidence of this, and has called for an independent inquiry into who was behind the attack.What followed was four days of tit-for-tat shelling and drone attacks, intensifying each day and culminating in missile strikes on military bases, which threatened to tip over into full-blown conflict. Then, suddenly, a ceasefire brokered by the US and other international players on 10 May brought the two nuclear powers back from the brink.Families on both sides of the Line of Control (LoC) - the de facto border in Kashmir - told us they had had loved ones killed and property destroyed. At least 16 people are reported to have been killed on the Indian side, while Pakistan claims 40 civilian deaths, though it remains unclear how many were directly caused by the shelling. We also heard from Indian and Pakistani government insiders about the mood in their respective administrations as the conflict escalated.In Delhi's corridors of power, the atmosphere was initially jubilant, an Indian government source told the BBC. Its missile attacks on targets in Pakistan-administered Kashmir and in Pakistan itself - including the Bilal Mosque in Muzaff arabad, which India claims is a militant camp, though Pakistan denies this - were deemed a success.""The strikes… were not limited to Pakistani-administered Kashmir or along the Line of Control,"" an Indian government source told the BBC. ""We went deep - even into the Pakistani side of Punjab, which has always been Pakistan's red line.""But the Pakistani military had been prepared, a source from the Pakistan Air Force told the BBC. Days earlier, the Pakistani government said it was expecting an attack.""We knew something was coming, and we were absolutely ready,"" one officer said, speaking on condition of anonymity. He said Indian fighter jets approached Pakistani territory and the air force was under instructions to shoot down any that crossed into its airspace or dropped a payload.Pakistan claims to have shot down five Indian jets that night, something India has remained silent on.""We were well prepared, and honestly, we were also lucky,"" the source said - his account repeated by two other sources.But Mr Sudhan, Vihaan's grandfather, said there had been no warning to stay indoors or evacuate. ""Why didn't they inform us? We, the people, are caught in the middle.""It is likely that no evacuation orders had been issued because the Indian government needed to keep the military strikes confidential, though the local administration had, following the April militant attack, directed locals to clean out community bunkers as a precautionary measure.A day after the initial missile strikes, Thursday, both sides launched drone attacks, though they each accused the other of making the first move.India began to evacuate thousands of villagers along the Indian side of the LoC. Just after 21:00 that evening, the Khan family in India-administered Kashmir decided they must flee their home in Uri, 270km (168 miles) to the north of Poonch. Most of their neighbours had already left.But after travelling for just 10 minutes, their vehicle was struck by shrapnel from a shell, fatally injuring 47-year-old Nargis. Her sister-in-law Hafeeza was seriously injured. They headed to the nearest hospital, only to find the gates locked.""I somehow climbed the hospital wall and called out for help, telling them we had injured people with us. Only then did the staff come out and open the gate. As soon as they did, I collapsed. The doctors were terrified by the ongoing shelling and had closed everything out of fear,"" Hafeeza said.Hafeeza's sister-in-law Nargis is survived by six children. The youngest daughter Sanam, 20, said the first hospital they went to was not equipped to help, and as they headed to another, her mother died of her injuries.""A piece of shrapnel had torn through her face. My clothes were soaked in her blood… We kept talking to her, urging her to stay with us. But she passed away on the way.""Since a ceasefire agreement between India and Pakistan in 2021 there had been relative peace in the region, locals told the BBC. For the first time in years, they had been able to live normal lives, they said, and now this sense of security was destroyed.Sanam, who lost her mother, said: ""I appeal to both governments - if you're heading into war, at least secure your civilians. Prepare... Those who sit in comfort and demand war - they should be sent to the borders. Let them witness what it really means. Let them lose someone before their eyes.""Sajjad Shafi, the representative for Uri in the regional government, said he had acted as promptly as possible.""The moment I got the news that India has attacked, I got in touch with people and started moving them out.""After two days of attacks and counter attacks, the Indian government source said there was now a ""clear sense in… power corridors that things were escalating but we were ready.""We were ready because India had spent the last 10 years acquiring and building strategic military assets - missiles, warheads and defence systems.""On the international stage, there had been consternation that the tensions would not be de-escalated by the US, despite its diplomatic overtures during India and Pakistan's previous Kashmir clashes.US Vice President JD Vance said a potential war would be ""none of our business"".This statement came as no surprise, the Indian government source told the BBC. At that stage, ""it was clear the US didn't want to get involved"".By the following day, Friday, shelling had become more intense.Muhammed Shafi was at home with his wife in Shahkot village in the Neelum Valley, Pakistan-administered Kashmir, on the LoC.The 30-year-old was standing in the doorway, just a few steps away from where his son was playing; his wife standing in their courtyard.""I remember looking up and seeing a mortar shell coming from a distance. In the blink of an eye, it struck her. She didn't even have time to scream. One second she was there, and the next, she was gone. Her face... her head... there was nothing left. Just a cloud of smoke and dust. My ears went numb. Everything went silent. I didn't even realise I was screaming.""That night, her body lay there, right in our home. The entire village was hiding in bunkers. The shelling continued all night, and I stayed beside her, weeping. I held her hand for as long as I could.""One of those in a bunker was his niece, 18-year-old Umaima. She and her family were holed up in the shelter for four days, on and off, in brutal conditions.""There were six or seven of us packed into it,"" she said. ""The other bunker was already full. There's no place to lie down in there - some people stood, others sat. There was no drinking water, no food,"" with people shouting, crying and reciting prayers in the pitch black.Also in a bunker, in the Leepa Valley, Pakistan-Administered Kashmir - one of the most militarised and vulnerable valleys in the region - was Shams Ur Rehman and family. It is Shams's own bunker, but that night he shared it with 36 other people, he said.Leepa is surrounded on three sides by the LoC and Indian-administered territory, so Shams was used to living with cross-border tensions. But he was not prepared for the complete destruction of his house.He left the bunker at three in the morning to survey the scene.""Everything was gone. Wooden beams and debris from the house were scattered everywhere. The blast was so powerful, the shockwave pushed in the main wall. The metal sheets on the roof were shredded. The entire structure shifted - by at least two inches.""A house is a person's life's work. You're always trying to improve it - but in the end, it's all gone in seconds.""Four hours later, back in the Neelum Valley, Umaima and her family also emerged on Saturday 10 May to a transformed landscape.""We came out of the bunker at seven in the morning. That's when we saw - nothing was left.""As Umaima surveyed the ruins of her village, India and Pakistan's forces that day were trading ever more destructive blows - firing missiles at each other's military installations, which both sides accused the other of instigating.India had targeted three Pakistani air bases, including one in Rawalpindi - the garrison city that houses the Pakistan Army's General Headquarters.""This was a red line crossed,"" said one Pakistani officer. ""The prime minister gave the go-ahead to the army chief. We already had a plan, and our forces were desperately ready to execute it… For anyone in uniform, it was one of those unforgettable days.""Pakistan hit back at Indian military installations. On the diplomatic front, this was seen as a moment to highlight the issue of Kashmir on the international stage, an official in the Pakistan foreign office told the BBC.""It was non-stop. Endless meetings, coordination, and back-to-back calls to and from other countries for both foreign minister and then the prime minister. We welcomed mediation offers from the US, the Saudis, the Iranians, or anyone who could help de-escalate.""On the Indian side, the Pahalgam attack on 22 April had already prompted External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar to speak to at least 17 world leaders or diplomats, including UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. In most of these conversations, he has tweeted, the emphasis had been on the ""cross-border terrorist attack"" and focused on building a case to hold the perpetrators accountable for the attack.Then, on Saturday afternoon local time, in the aftermath of the latest missile exchanges, came a diplomatic breakthrough out of nowhere. US President Donald Trump took to social media to reveal that a ceasefire had been agreed.""After a long night of talks mediated by the United States, I am pleased to announce that India and Pakistan have agreed to a FULL AND IMMEDIATE CEASEFIRE.""Congratulations to both Countries on using Common Sense and Great Intelligence,"" he wrote on social media platform Truth Social.India has since downplayed Washington's role in the ceasefire and it has rejected that trade was used as a lever to achieve this.Behind the scenes, US mediators, diplomatic backchannels and regional players, including the US, the UK and Saudi Arabia, had proved critical in negotiating the climbdown, experts say.""We hit Pakistani strategic bases deep inside their territory and that must have worried the US,"" the Indian government source believes.In Pahalgam, the site of the militant gun attack that sparked the crisis, the search is still on for the perpetrators.Vinay Narwal, a 26-year-old Indian Navy officer, was on his honeymoon in Pahalgam when he was killed. He had got married just a week before the attack.A photo of Vinay's wife Himanshi, sitting near her husband's body following the attack, has been widely shared on social media.His grandfather Hawa Singh Narwal wants ""exemplary punishment"" for the killers.""This terrorism should end. Today, I lost my grandson. Tomorrow, someone else will lose their loved one,"" he said.A witness to the attack's aftermath, Rayees Ahmad Bhat, who used to lead pony treks to the beauty spot where the shootings took place, said his industry was now in ruins.""The attackers may have killed tourists that day, but we - the people of Pahalgam - are dying every day since. They've stained the name of this peaceful town… Pahalgam is terrorised, and its people broken.""The attack was a huge shock for a government which had begun to actively promote tourism in stunningly picturesque Kashmir, famed for its lush valleys, lakes and snow-capped mountains.The source in the Indian administration said this might have lulled Delhi into a false sense of security.""Perhaps we got carried away by the response to tourism in Kashmir. We thought we were over a hump but we were not.""The four-day conflict has once again shown how fragile peace can be between the two nations.Additional reporting by Vikas Pandey in Delhi",Operation Sindoor,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgvr4r5d2qo,BBC,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""framing"", ""reason"": ""The article presents a balanced view of the conflict from both Indian and Pakistani perspectives, but frames India's actions as 'armed response' and 'missile strikes', while Pakistan's actions are described as 'shelling'"", ""confidence"": 0.8}",no,none,"armed response like terms are not framing, they are accurate depiction"
93,How India and Pakistan share one of the world's most dangerous borders,"To live along the Line of Control (LoC) - the volatile de facto border that separates India and Pakistan - is to exist perpetually on the razor's edge between fragile peace and open conflict.The recent escalation after the Pahalgam attack brought India and Pakistan to the brink once again. Shells rained down on both sides of the LoC, turning homes to rubble and lives into statistics. At least 16 people were reportedly killed on the Indian side, while Pakistan claims 40 civilian deaths, though it remains unclear how many were directly caused by the shelling.""Families on the LoC are subjected to Indian and Pakistani whims and face the brunt of heated tensions,"" Anam Zakaria, a Pakistani writer based in Canada, told the BBC.""Each time firing resumes many are thrust into bunkers, livestock and livelihood is lost, infrastructure - homes, hospitals, schools - is damaged. The vulnerability and volatility experienced has grave repercussions for their everyday lived reality,"" Ms Zakaria, author of a book on Pakistan-administered Kashmir, said.India and Pakistan share a 3,323km (2,064-mile) border, including the 740km-long LoC; and the International Border (IB), spanning roughly 2,400km. The LoC began as the Ceasefire Line in 1949 after the first India-Pakistan war, and was renamed under the 1972 Simla Agreement.The LoC cutting through Kashmir - claimed in full and administered in parts by both India and Pakistan - remains one of the most militarised borders in the world. Conflict is never far behind and ceasefires are only as durable as the next provocation.Ceasefire violations here can range from ""low-level firing to major land grabbing to surgical strikes"", says Happymon Jacob, a foreign policy expert at Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU). (A land grab could involve seizing key positions such as hilltops, outposts, or buffer zones by force.)The LoC, many experts say, is a classic example of a ""border drawn in blood, forged through conflict"". It is also a line, as Ms Zakaria says, ""carved by India and Pakistan, and militarised and weaponised, without taking Kashmiris into account"".Such wartime borders aren't unique to South Asia. Sumantra Bose, professor of international and comparative politics at Krea University in India and author of Kashmir at the Crossroads: Inside a 21st-Century Conflict, says the  most well-known is the 'Green Line'  - the ceasefire line of 1949 - which is the generally recognised boundary between Israel and the West Bank.Not surprisingly, the tentative calm along the LoC that had endured since the 2021 ceasefire agreement between the two nuclear-armed neighbours crumbled easily after the latest hostilities.""The current escalation on the LoC and International Border (IB) is significant as it follows a four-year period of relative peace on the border,"" Surya Valliappan Krishna of Carnegie India told the BBC.Violence along the India-Pakistan border is not new - prior to the 2003 ceasefire, India reported 4,134 violations in 2001 and 5,767 in 2002.The 2003 ceasefire initially held, with negligible violations from 2004 to 2007, but tensions resurfaced in 2008 and escalated sharply by 2013.Between 2013 and early 2021, the LoC and the IB witnessed sustained high levels of conflict. A renewed ceasefire in February 2021 led to an immediate and sustained drop in violations through to March 2025.""During periods of intense cross-border firing we've seen border populations in the many thousands be displaced for months on end,"" says Mr Krishna. Between late September and early December 2016, more than 27,000 people were displaced from border areas due to ceasefire violations and cross-border firing.It's looking increasingly hairy and uncertain now.Tensions flared after the Pahalgam attack, with India suspending the key water-sharing treaty between India and Pakistan, known as the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT). Pakistan responded by threatening to exit the 1972 Simla Agreement, which formalised the LoC - though it hasn't followed through yet.""This is significant because the Simla Agreement is the basis of the current LoC, which both sides agreed to not alter unilaterally in spite of their political differences,"" says Mr Krishna.Mr Jacob says for some ""curious reason"", ceasefire violations along the LoC have been absent from discussions and debates about escalation of conflict between the two countries.""It is itself puzzling how the regular use of high-calibre weapons such as 105mm mortars, 130 and 155mm artillery guns and anti-tank guided missiles by two nuclear-capable countries, which has led to civilian and military casualties, has escaped scholarly scrutiny and policy attention,"" Mr Jacob writes in his book, Line On Fire: Ceasefire Violations and India-Pakistan Escalation Dynamics.Mr Jacob identifies two main triggers for the violations: Pakistan often uses cover fire to facilitate militant infiltration into Indian-administered Kashmir, which has witnessed an armed insurgency against Indian rule for over three decades. Pakistan, in turn, accuses India of unprovoked firing on civilian areas.He argues that ceasefire violations along the India-Pakistan border are less the product of high-level political strategy and more the result of local military dynamics.The hostilities are often initiated by field commanders - sometimes with, but often without, central approval. He also challenges the notion that the Pakistan Army alone drives the violations, pointing instead to a complex mix of local military imperatives and autonomy granted to border forces on both sides.Some experts believe It's time to revisit an idea shelved nearly two decades ago: turning the LoC into a formal, internationally recognised border. Others insist that possibility was never realistic - and still isn't.""The idea is completely infeasible, a dead end. For decades, Indian maps have shown the entire territory of the erstwhile princely state of Jammu and Kashmir as part of India,"" Sumantra Bose told the BBC.""For Pakistan, making the LoC part of the International Border would mean settling the Kashmir dispute - which is Pakistan's equivalent of the Holy Grail - on India's preferred terms. Every Pakistani government and leader, civilian or military, over the past seven decades has rejected this.""In his 2003 book, Kashmir: Roots of Conflict, Paths to Peace, Prof Bose writes: ""A Kashmir settlement necessitates that the LoC be transformed - from an iron curtain of barbed wire, bunkers, trenches and hostile militaries to a linen curtain. Realpolitik dictates that the border will be permanent (albeit probably under a different name), but it must be transcended without being abolished.""""I stressed, though, that such a transformation of the LoC must be embedded in a broader Kashmir settlement, as one pillar of a multi-pillared settlement,"" he told the BBC.Between 2004 and 2007, turning the LoC into a soft border was central to a fledgling India-Pakistan peace process on Kashmir - a process that ultimately fell apart.Today, the border has reignited, bringing back the cycle of violence and uncertainty for those who live in its shadow.""You never know what will happen next. No one wants to sleep facing the Line of Control tonight,"" an employee of a hotel in Pakistan-administered Kashmir told BBC Urdu during the recent hostilities.It was a quiet reminder of how fragile peace is when your window opens to a battlefield.",Operation Sindoor,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgmj7l0lne3o,BBC,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""framing"", ""reason"": ""The article frames the conflict between India and Pakistan as a perpetual and intractable problem, emphasizing the 'fragile peace' and 'open conflict' along the LoC.

94,India says it killed militants who shot dead tourists in Kashmir,"India has said its security forces killed three militants who shot dead 26 civilians near a tourist town in Indian-administered Kashmir in April, triggering a brief military conflict with Pakistan.Home Minister Amit Shah told parliament the men had been killed by Indian forces near the disputed region's main city Srinagar on Monday.He claimed the attackers were Pakistani nationals, a charge Islamabad denies. The men's identity was confirmed through forensic and ballistic tests, Shah told MPs.Pakistan has not commented on the claims, which have not been independently confirmed and come amid mounting criticism of India's government for alleged security lapses in Kashmir.Twenty-six men, mostly Hindu tourists, were killed by gunmen who opened fire at a mountain meadow not far from the scenic town of Pahalgam on 22 April, in one of the deadliest attacks in the region in recent years.The victims were killed in cold blood in front of their wives and family members. A local Muslim pony handler who tried to help them was also shot dead.Delhi accused Islamabad of supporting militant groups involved in the attack - a charge Pakistan has repeatedly denied. In May, India launched a series of strikes on sites in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir.Pakistan responded with drones, missiles and fighter jets, leading to four days of intense military action from both sides.Dozens of people were killed in the bloodiest confrontation between India and Pakistan in decades, before US President Donald Trump announced a ceasefire between them.India's opposition leaders have accused the government of ""severe security lapses"" and have been questioning why it has taken this much time to catch the attackers.In parliament on Monday, Congress MP Gaurav Gogoi demanded that Shah should personally take responsibility for the attack.""The country wants to know why the government has not been able to nab the terrorists even after 100 days since the attack,"" he said.Shah responded on Tuesday, saying that security forces had ""neutralised the three terrorists"" involved in the attack in a mission called ""Operation Mahadev"".The three died in a gun battle in a wildlife reserve in the mountains of Dachigam, about 30km (18 miles) from Srinagar, the Indian army said on Monday. The clash could not be independently confirmed by the BBC. The army did not immediately identify those it killed.But on Tuesday, Shah claimed the men - who he identified as Suleiman Shah, Afghan and Jibran - were Pakistani nationals.""When the terrorists were killed [on Monday], we recovered three rifles - one M9 American rifle and two AK-47s. The cartridges we had collected were also from an M9 and AK-47. We sent the rifles last night to the central forensics lab in Chandigarh where they fired them, and these were then compared and it was confirmed these were the three rifles used in the attack to kill our innocent citizens,"" Shah said.""I have the ballistic report,"" he told the house, holding up some papers. ""Six scientists have cross verified it. They told me this morning on a video call these are 100% the bullets that they had fired.""At the beginning of the investigation in May, Indian police had issued sketches of three men, saying two were Pakistanis while one was a local man.But in June, Indian investigators said all three militants were Pakistani nationals from the UN-proscribed militant group Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) after it arrested two locals for allegedly sheltering the suspected militants prior to the attack.However, on Tuesday, Shah clarified that only two men - Suleiman Shah and Afghan - were believed to be LeT members. He did not say which group the Indian authorities thought the third militant Jibran was associated with.The militants were identified by locals who had provided them shelter, he claimed.""We have voter ID numbers of the two of them, we have weapons recovered from them. The chocolates recovered from them are also made in Pakistan,"" Shah said.""They killed our tourists and now they have been killed.""Shah also defended the speed of the investigation amid questions on how the three men had managed to remain undetected over the past three months.""Right after the attack, we handed over the investigation to the National Investigation Agency (NIA),"" he said.""We made all arrangements with the security and border forces to ensure they [culprits] couldn't leave the country.""Some opposition leaders, however, remained unconvinced and questioned the lack of security in Pahalgam on the day of the attack.""Why was not even one security personnel present there?""

95,India denies it was pressured into ending conflict with Pakistan,"India's defence ministry has rejected US President Donald Trump's claim of ending its conflict with Pakistan in May, saying the country had not responded to pressure from anyone.Rajnath Singh was speaking at the opening of a parliamentary debate on the 22 April attack in Pahalgam, in Indian-administered Kashmir, which claimed the lives of 26 tourists.India blamed Pakistan for the attack - which it denied - and launched a series of strikes, named ""Operation Sindoor"", on its neighbour, leading to four days of intense military action from both sides.Trump has frequently claimed that the ceasefire between the two nuclear-armed neighbours was brokered by the US - which India has denied.On Monday, Singh reiterated that it was ""completely incorrect and baseless to say that the military action was stopped because of pressure"".""India halted its operation because all the political and military objectives studied before and during the conflict had been fully achieved,"" he told the Lok Sabha, the lower house of parliament.He also claimed the decision was taken after a request from Pakistan's Director General of Military Operations (DGMO), who ""pleaded for relief"".""It was only after this that the Indian Armed Forces decided to pause operations,"" he added. Islamabad has not commented on Singh's claims.The escalation in May was the worst military confrontation between India and Pakistan in decades, with dozens of people killed in the four-day fighting, before Trump announced a ceasefire between them.Singh said the purpose of India's military action was ""to destroy the terror nurseries raised by Pakistan over the years"".He said over 100 ""terrorists, their trainers, handlers and associates"" were killed in coordinated strikes on nine ""terror infrastructure targets"" in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered-Kashmir in an operation that lasted 22 minutes.""The objective was to provide justice to the families who lost their loved ones in the Pahalgam terror attack,"" he said.During the proceedings, opposition leaders questioned the government about Islamabad's claim that it shot down five Indian fighter jets and a drone during the conflict.Singh denied this and said India's defence systems had intercepted all incoming projectiles and missiles, adding that no Indian military establishment suffered any damage.He also said the Indian armed forces could resume military action if there was any further ""misadventure"" from the Pakistan side.Earlier in the day, the Indian army said that it had killed ""three terrorists"" in a gun battle in Indian-administered Kashmir.Indian TV channels claimed the three were suspected to be behind the April attack - but officials have not confirmed this.Indian investigators have previously said all three militants involved in the deadly attack were Pakistani nationals from the UN-proscribed militant group Lashkar-e-TaibaFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook.",Operation Sindoor,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y204pmrp2o,BBC,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""source"", ""reason"": ""The article relies on Indian Defence Ministry's rejection of Trump's claim without providing a direct quote from Pakistan's side, indicating a preference for Indian sources."", ""confidence"": 0.8}",no,none,no sourc bias
96,The beauty and brutality of life in the shadow of Kashmir killings,"A centuries-old Persian couplet often repeated in Indian-administered Kashmir translates to: ""If there is a paradise on earth, it is here, it is here, it is here."" And many Kashmiris insist it was written with Pahalgam in mind.The small town, nestled between tall Himalayan mountains with a gurgling Lidder River flowing through it, is called the mini-Switzerland of India.The valleys and meadows here have long provided stunning locations for Bollywood romances and attracted tens of thousands of tourists escaping the heat and dust of Indian plains.But on 22 April, the tranquil valley hit global headlines when a sprawling meadow here turned into killing fields.Militants singled out male Hindu tourists and murdered 25 of them in front of their families in Baisaran, a beauty spot about 7km from the town. A local Muslim pony handler who tried to help tourists was also shot dead.The massacre brought nuclear-armed India and Pakistan to the brink of war. India blamed Pakistan for the killings – an accusation Islamabad denied – and the two countries attacked each other with missiles and drones over four days in May after which a fragile truce was agreed.But in Pahalgam, time seems to have slowed down and the residents are trying to pick up the pieces and move on.When I recently visited Pahalgam, where a large majority makes a living through tourism, I found a land and its people trying to deal with the collective trauma, mourning the loss of lives - and livelihoods. The peak tourist season here is April to June - and this year, most of it has already been lost.""What happened here is condemnable… an inhuman act. Innocent people were killed,"" says Javeed Burza, president of Pahalgam Hotels and Restaurants association.Standing in the rear lawns of his hotel, he watches the Lidder roar past. On the other side are huge mountains covered by a thick carpet of trees. It's this sort of view that made this valley in south Kashmir such a sought-after destination.Mr Burza says visitors came from all over India for its lakes, forests, meadows and glaciers – and went back raving about the local people and their hospitality.""People here are poor, they live hand-to-mouth, but they are known to be very kind and helpful. Now we are all facing the consequences of this senseless violence,"" he adds. ""We had bookings right until the end of June. But then everything fell apart like a pack of cards. There's not much left here now.""The region's Chief Minister Omar Abdullah says in the immediate aftermath of the attack, tourists fled the town and people who were proposing to come cancelled.To persuade tourists to give Pahalgam another chance, he visited the town within weeks of the attack, held a cabinet meeting there and, ignoring advice of security officials, cycled through the streets.For Mr Abdullah, Pahalgam's wellbeing is personal.""It's where our school picnics were; it's where we probably first dipped our toes in running water. For some of us it's the first time we went white water rafting or trout fishing. For others, it's a day or overnight visit. For us, it's part of our growing up.""Mr Abdullah says it's always hard to make predictions but he hopes to see Pahalgam ""where it was on 21 April this year"".On that day, it was packed with tourists, says Fayyaz Ahmad, who sells Kashmiri embroidered shawls and dresses in Pahalgam's main market, with shops lining both sides of the only road that passes through the town.Many remain shuttered, but a few have begun to open in the hope of attracting customers. The day I met him was the first he'd opened his shop since the killings.The last three seasons – post-Covid years – had been marked by bumper visits, Mr Ahmad says.""Every morning at least 3,000 cars would arrive by 11am. There would be traffic jams lasting two-three hours. Many tourists would say they couldn't find accommodation.""His own shop sometimes got so crowded that a queue of shoppers would form outside. ""Business was brisk,"" he said. But now he's had to let three salesmen go. They would be rehired only if business picked up, he said.The targeting of tourists has left him bewildered. Since 1989, when an anti-India militancy gripped Kashmir valley, Mr Ahmad says, ""the situation was really bad here"".""We were afraid to step out of our homes, but tourists who chose to come here were never harmed. We can't understand why they've been targeted now. Who could do such a thing?"" he asks.India blamed Pakistan-backed militants for the massacre in a region that both countries claim in full, but control only in parts.Delhi accuses its neighbour of fuelling a long-running insurgency that has killed tens of thousands in Indian-administered Kashmir. Islamabad has long denied backing militants there.In recent years, the insurgency had abated, bringing millions of tourists and a growing sense that the region was finally becoming safer. But that has now changed.""Pahalgam ke naam par dhabba lag gaya [Pahalgam's name is stained],"" laments Nisar Ali, an 80-year-old resident who makes a living by selling papier mache products.""People had taken loans to open shops and buy taxis, now everyone is staring at an uncertain future. What's happened to our paradise,"" he asks.Just 2km from the market, a signboard points to the untarred road that goes up to Baisaran, a 5km trek covered on foot or ponies. The concertina wire used to barricade the road has been moved to one side and local people and flocks of sheep can be seen making their way down.Before the killings, it was one of the most popular places for tourists. The meadow offering a great view of the valley was open from 08:00 to 17:00 and would get thousands of visitors daily in the summer.But it remains out of bounds now. Two men have been arrested for allegedly providing shelter to the militants, but those who carried out the killings have still not been caught - leading to fears that they could return.Abdul Wahid Wani, the president of Pahalgam pony owners' union, who was the first to arrive at the scene, says 1,090 tourists had gone up to the meadow until 14:00.At the time of the attack, there were about 300 tourists in Baisaran, he estimates.At 14:36, he says, he received a call from the police asking him if he had heard anything about an incident at Baisaran.""I tried calling colleagues who had taken tourists up to the meadow, but no-one answered. I figured something was wrong and my brother and I ran all the way up and reached there at 15:10.""The police and paramilitaries arrived 15 minutes later. That night, Mr Wani, wrapped up at 02:30. He says what he saw there keeps him awake at nights.""I saw women and children crying and screaming. I saw bodies on the ground. I saw 10-15 people injured.""In the first videos of the aftermath that went viral on the day of the attack, Mr Wani can be heard trying to reassure the survivors, offering them water, telling them he was there to help.He summoned other pony handlers who arrived at the scene to help evacuate people - ""carrying them down on our backs and wooden cots"" - and gather bodies strewn about the vast field.""I still can't forget what I saw that day. I panicked; I had palpitations. I'd never seen anything like that before.""When I met him in Pahalgam, he looked tired, his eyes sunk deep into his lined face.""For many nights I couldn't sleep and sleep still eludes me. With the militants still on the loose, I worry what will happen if they come after us because we helped people they were trying to kill?""But earlier this week, we exchanged messages and he sounded more optimistic.The town has sprung back to life, with thousands of pilgrims arriving to take part in Amarnath Yatra - the annual Hindu pilgrimage to the Amarnath cave shrine. It began on 3 July and will go on until 9 August.Dozens of camps have been set up and thousands of police and security forces have been deployed along the route to ensure security.Pahalgam is one of the two starting points for the trek to the shrine – and as many pilgrims hire ponies to take them part of the way, there's a steady stream of work for Mr Wani and his colleagues.But hoteliers and shop-owners say they will have to wait for their turn until after the end of the pilgrimage since most pilgrims stay in cheaper camps and rarely purchase crafts.But many are taking heart from the fact that tourists have begun returning to the region. Ravi Gosain, president of All India Tour Operators, says in June, 40% of more than 45,000 tourists who visited the Kashmir Valley went to Pahalgam.On the day I visited, there were families stopping for photographs under a ""Love Pahalgam"" sign.Shabiba and Hamid Jaffar, who had visited last year around the same time, said it was so crowded then that they had to wait for half an hour to be able to take a photo here.""When we decided to come this year, our friends tried to discourage us saying it's not safe,"" says Shabiba. ""But it's totally safe and my children are so happy that they are saying let's move to Kashmir.""Mr Jaffar says their friends are calling them after seeing their photos. ""And I'm telling them to come here for a holiday. Where will you see this beauty?

97,Indian investigators now claim all Pahalgam attackers were Pakistan nationals,"Indian investigators say all three militants involved in April's deadly attack on tourists near Indian-administered Kashmir's Pahalgam town were Pakistani nationals from the UN-proscribed militant group Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT).Police had earlier issued sketches of three men saying two were Pakistanis while one was a local man.The claim by the National Investigative Agency (NIA) came after it arrested two local men for allegedly sheltering the attackers. Pakistan has not commented on these claims.It had earlier rejected involvement in the attacks in which 26 people were killed. The attack in Baisaran, a popular tourist spot, had brought  India and Pakistan on the brink of war.The nuclear-armed South Asian neighbours, who have fought three wars over Kashmir, claim the region in full but administer it in parts.The killings on 22 April had sent shockwaves through India and the case was handed over to NIA, a federal investigative agency.Security forces had launched a major search and combing operation in the region and thousands were detained across Kashmir for questioning.The three attackers are, however, yet to be caught.In a statement on Sunday, NIA said the arrested men had ""knowingly harboured the three armed terrorists at a seasonal dhol (hut)"" before the 22 April attack. It did not give details of when the arrests took place and as those arrested are in custody, they have not made any statement.A little-known group, The Resistance Front (TRF), allied with the Lashkar-e-Taiba, had initially said it was behind the attack but later disowned it.Within days of the attack, India revoked the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty, a long-standing water-sharing agreement with Pakistan. Islamabad, in turn, withdrew from the 1972 Simla agreement that sought to settle differences through bilateral negotiations and peaceful means.India followed it by launching air and missile attacks on 7 May, targeting sites it called ""terror infrastructure in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir"".Pakistan denied the claim that these were terror camps and also responded by firing missiles and deploying drones into Indian territory.The hostilities between the two countries continued until 10 May when US President Donald Trump announced a ceasefire.Follow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook",Operation Sindoor,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c36xe95g06zo,BBC,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""source"", ""reason"": ""The article relies on Indian investigators' claims without providing a direct quote or statement from Pakistan's side, despite mentioning that Pakistan has not commented on these claims."", ""confidence"": 0.8}",no,none,no source bias
98,'Tourists are our lifeline': Picking up the pieces in Kashmir after April killings,"Two months after a deadly attack in Indian-administered Kashmir scared away tourists and brought India and Pakistan to the brink of war, the picturesque valley nestled in the Himalayan mountains is beginning to see the first signs of a tourism revival.Shabana Awwal is making videos of her children as they take turns to get on a water bike for a ride on the Dal Lake, Srinagar city's most iconic tourist spot.Ms Awwal has travelled from the western state of Rajasthan with her husband and children in a group of 15 - all members of their extended family.""I've visited Kashmir many times and seen all the major attractions such as Gulmarg, Sonmarg and Pahalgam and wanted to show all these places to my relatives,"" she tells the BBC.The Awwals had planned their 10-day trip in March. ""Summer in Rajasthan is unbearably hot so we'd planned to escape to Kashmir during the children's school vacation,"" she says.But since she planned the trip, the circumstances here have drastically changed. On 22 April, militants attacked tourists visiting a beauty spot near Pahalgam town, killing 26 men.Tourism is the mainstay of the economy of Jammu and Kashmir, a federally-administered territory, and this unprecedented targeting of tourists sent shockwaves through India. The authorities closed down 48 tourist destinations in the valley and two-thirds of them still remain shut.Chief Minister Omar Abdullah, who's been lobbying hard to reopen these spots to attract visitors to the region, says ""the impact of the attack was immediate and very widely felt"".""There was a mass exodus of those tourists who were already here, and a mass cancellation of those who were proposing to come. Then India and Pakistan, for all intents and purposes, were almost at war for a couple of days in May,"" Abdullah told the BBC.""So the lasting impact has been felt both in the deterioration of relations between the two neighbouring countries and our tourism season for the year is going to be, what word do I use for it? I guess you can call it a disaster.""Kashmir, claimed by both India and Pakistan, has been a flashpoint for decades. The nuclear-armed South Asian neighbours have fought two wars and a limited conflict over Kashmir. For more than a quarter of a century, the region has seen an armed insurgency against Indian rule, but even at its peak, tourists were rarely targeted.Ms Awwal said her family decided to continue with their holiday because ""we weren't really afraid"" and ""we thought we'll deal with whatever came our way"".""We are happy that we went ahead with our plans. The situation here is normal,"" she says and blames the ""media hype"" for the impression that it's unsafe to travel to Kashmir.The Awwals are not alone in their optimism. Deepti and Anuj Gandhi of Jammu who made their plans just last week say ""there's no summer holiday destination better than Kashmir"".""The children love to ride water bikes and then we'll go boating in the lake. We come here every year, so why break the tradition now?"" she says.Earlier this week, news agency ANI reported that a group of Polish tourists had arrived in the city.The arrivals merely weeks after the Pahalgam attack are a cause of optimism for hoteliers, taxi drivers, tour guides, shopkeepers and owners of shikaras – the Venetian gondola-like narrow colourful wooden boats that ferry tourists on the Dal Lake.In April, president of the shikara owners' association Haji Wali Mohammad Bhat says, the Dal Lake boulevard was packed with thousands of tourists, there were daily traffic jams and many complained they were finding it hard to get accommodation.""The attack on tourists was unfortunate and tragic,"" he says.""It has affected all of us and our livelihoods. Tourists are our life, tourism is our lifeline. God knows what sin we're paying for,"" he adds, despairingly.Ravi Gosain, president of Indian Association of Tour Operators, who recently led a three-day ""fact-finding trip"" of tour operators - as ""they are the ones who send travellers to Kashmir"" says ""for the past few years tourism was flourishing in Kashmir, lots of new hotels had been built, new vehicles were bought and new shops had opened"".Last year, the government said 23.6 million tourists visited Jammu and Kashmir, with 3.49 million visiting the valley.This year, Mr Gosain says, the peak season has been lost in the valley, but tourism can still pick up.""Locals are very welcoming, hoteliers, tour guides and shopkeepers are very friendly and people are coming back. You can see it – all flights are coming in full, tourism is bouncing back quickly.""I think the national sentiment is that if the purpose of the attack was to derail tourism, then it won't succeed. But I hope no untoward incident happens again,"" he adds.According to reports, some of the credit for the revival of tourism in Kashmir also goes to a new train link that has for the first time connected Srinagar with the rest of India.The twice-daily train from Srinagar to Katra station, in Jammu region – which recently made headlines for passing over ""the world's highest single-arch railway bridge"" – has been running packed and tickets have been sold out for the next two months.Katra, which is the starting point for those visiting the popular Hindu shrine of Vaishno Devi, attracted 9.48 million pilgrims last year.And many of those arriving there since 7 June, when the spanking new air-conditioned train was commissioned, have been hopping on it to go to Kashmir.Among the pilgrims taking advantage of the easy connectivity is Ghanshyam Bharadwaj and his wife Mamata Sharma and their children. For the Delhi-based couple enjoying hot sugary tea near the Dal Lake, coming to Srinagar was ""a spur of the moment decision"".""It took us just three hours from Katra. We'll spend the night here and take the train back to Katra tomorrow and travel on to Delhi,"" Mr Bharadwaj said.""I ask him if he was worried travelling to the valley so soon after the Pahalgam attack?""There's nothing to be afraid of. This is my country,"" he says.Chief Minister Abdullah says the fact that the pilgrims are choosing to come to the valley is a good start.""Now those who are coming for a few hours, I'd like to see them come for a few days. Those who are coming for a few days, I'd like to see them having the confidence to stay for a week.""But at least it's a beginning, and that's what helps.""Follow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.",Operation Sindoor,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly8lx75d6ro,BBC,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""tonality"", ""reason"": ""The article's tone is generally optimistic and reassuring about the safety of tourism in Kashmir, with quotes from locals and tourists downplaying the impact of the attack.

99,"An Indian teacher was killed - then he got falsely labelled a ""terrorist""","Farooq Ahmed still bristles with anger when he talks about his brother's death.Mohammad Iqbal, a resident of Poonch city in Indian-administered Kashmir, died in cross-border shelling on 7 May, the morning after India launched a series of air strikes in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir in retaliation to a militant attack in the town of Pahalgam that killed 26 people. Pakistan has denied having any role in the attack.Mr Ahmed says that Iqbal died where he had worked for more than two decades - Zia-ul-Uloom, a madrassa, or a religious centre focused on Islamic teachings, in Poonch.But his death, it turned out, was just the beginning of the family's troubles.As the news spread, several media channels falsely accused Iqbal of being a terrorist, following which the police put out a statement refuting the claim.""My brother was a teacher but they saw his beard and skullcap and branded him a terrorist,"" Mr Ahmed says.""It was like having salt rubbed into our wounds. We had lost Iqbal and then the media defamed him. The dead can't defend themselves.""Indian officials say that a total of 16 people, including Iqbal, were killed in the cross-border shelling during the four-day military conflict that broke out between India and Pakistan following the airstrikes.Pakistan has claimed 40 civilian deaths, though, it remains unclear how many of these were directly caused by the shelling.The two nuclear-armed countries have shared a tense relationship for decades, as both administer the Himalayan region of Kashmir in part, but claim it in full.They have fought three wars over Kashmir since independence from Britain in 1947 and came back from the brink of another one earlier this month.But as the military conflict escalated, another battle played out on social media - a disinformation war of claims and counterclaims that circulated online and on TV.Just like rumours about Iqbal's identity, other misleading and inaccurate information also found its way into some mainstream news channels and websites.This included claims such as India having destroyed Pakistan's Karachi port, which was later debunked by the Indian government.Some of the other fabrications were harder to spot, like an AI-generated video of a Pakistan army general claiming that his country had lost two aircraft in combat.""The scale of misinformation and fact-free assertions being broadcast by the media was shocking,"" says Manisha Pande, managing editor at Newslaundry, an independent news platform.She notes that while a degree of sensationalism is expected as channels compete for viewership, ""the jingoistic and irresponsible coverage"" of the conflict was unprecedented in its intensity — and unlike anything she had witnessed before.No one knows this better than Mr Ahmed.""I don't know where news channels got the information about my brother from,"" Mr Ahmed says.""Who did they speak to? What kind of evidence did they have that my brother was a terrorist?"" he asks.Weeks later, the family is still reeling from the tragedy.Mr Ahmed says that on 7 May, his brother left home for the madrassa in the morning as usual, but it was his body that returned home. By noon, they had buried him in a nearby cemetery.For some time, the family had no idea about the misinformation that was being shared by some news outlets. They were busy performing Iqbal's last rites.It was only hours later that a relative received a WhatsApp forward - a video clip of a prominent news channel claiming that the Indian army had killed a terrorist, with Iqbal's photo flashing on the screen.""We were shocked. Soon, we began getting more calls from people asking us what was going on and why was the media calling Iqbal a terrorist,"" Mr Ahmed says.The claim was shared by some prominent channels, including Zee News, ABP and News18. The BBC has reached out to the channels for comment.One channel claimed that Iqbal was killed in an ""Indian strike on a terrorist camp"" in Pakistan-administered Kashmir, and that he was a terrorist with Pakistan-based terror group Lashkar-e-Taiba.""Our family members have been staying in Poonch for generations. How can they say my brother was living in Pakistan? They [the media] should be ashamed,"" Mr Ahmed says.The accusation against Iqbal was circulated so widely and swiftly that on 8 May, the Poonch police put out a statement, clarifying that Iqbal had died in cross-border shelling in the madrasa.""Poonch Police strongly refutes such false narratives. The deceased, Maulana Mohd Iqbal, was a respected religious figure in the local community and had no affiliation with any terror outfit,"" the statement said, adding that legal action would be taken against any media outlet or individual who circulated the fake news.But for Mr Ahmed, the statement was too little too late.""By then, the false claim would've already reached millions of people in India,"" he says.He adds that except for one channel, News18, no one else had publicly apologised to him or their viewers for the mistake.Mr Ahmed says he wants to take legal action against the channels, but the process would have to wait as the family is struggling to make ends meet.Iqbal is survived by his two wives and eight children. He was the only earning member in his family.Mr Ahmed says that the compensation given by the government, which amounts to a few million rupees, will last only for a year or two and they must start planning for the future now.""The whole family depended on my brother. He was a quiet and gentle man who loved teaching children,"" Mr Ahmed says.""But who's going to tell this to the world? For many people, my brother is still a terrorist whose killing is justified.

100,Is China the winner in the India-Pakistan conflict?,"The four-day conflict between arch-rivals India and Pakistan this month ended with a ceasefire and both claiming victory – but it now appears that China's defence industry might also be an unlikely winner.The latest flare-up began on 7 May when India launched attacks on what it called ""terrorist infrastructure"" inside Pakistan in response to the brutal killing of 26 people, mostly tourists by militants in Pahalgam on 22 April.Many of them were killed in the scenic valley in Indian-administered Kashmir in front of their wives and family members. Delhi accused Islamabad of supporting militant groups involved in the carnage, a charge Pakistan denied.After India's response - which it called Operation Sindoor - to the militant attack, tit-for-tat military manoeuvres from both sides followed, involving drones, missiles and fighter jets.India reportedly used its French and Russian-made jets, while Pakistan deployed its J-10 and J-17 aircraft, which Islamabad co-produces with Beijing. Both sides say their jets did not cross the border and they were firing missiles at each other from a distance.Islamabad claims that its fighter aircraft shot down at least six Indian planes, including the newly-acquired French-made Rafale fighter jets. Delhi hasn't responded to these claims.""Losses are a part of combat,"" Air Marshal AK Bharti of the Indian Air Force (IAF) said last week when a reporter asked him about these claims. Air Marshal Bharti declined to comment on the specific claim of Pakistan downing Indian jets.""We have achieved the objectives that we selected, and all our pilots are back home,"" he added.India said it had killed at least ""100 terrorists"" while targeting the headquarters of the banned Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed militant outfits based in Pakistan.A definitive account of what really happened in the aerial battle is yet to emerge. Some media outlets reported plane crashes in the state of Punjab and Indian-administered Kashmir around the same time but the Indian government has not responded to the reports.A Reuters report quoting American officials said Pakistan possibly had used the Chinese-made J-10 aircraft to launch air-to-air missiles against Indian fighter jets. Pakistan claiming victory after hugely relying on Chinese weapons systems in an active combat situation is being seen by some experts as a boost for Beijing's defence industry but some also disagree with the claim.Some of the experts have called this a ""DeepSeek moment"" for the Chinese weapons industry, referring to January this year when the Chinese AI start-up shook US giants with its cost-effective technology.""The aerial fight was a big advertisement for the Chinese weapons industry. Until now, China had no opportunity to test its platforms in a combat situation,"" Zhou Bo, a retired senior colonel in the Chinese People's Liberation Army, told the BBC.The Beijing-based analyst said the outcome of the air duel showed ""China has some systems that are next to none"". Shares in the Chinese Avic Chengdu Aircraft company, that manufactures fighter jets like the J-10, surged by up to 40% last week after the reported performance of the fighter jet in the India-Pakistan conflict.Other experts, however, feel it's too early to declare the superiority of Chinese weapons systems.Professor Walter Ladwig from the King's College in London said it was yet to be determined whether the Chinese jets had actually outmanoeuvred the Indian Air Force (IAF) planes, particularly the Rafale.""In a standard military doctrine, you would suppress the enemy's air defences and get air superiority before you struck ground targets. Instead, it appears the IAF's mission was clearly not to provoke any Pakistani military retaliation,"" he said.Mr Ladwig thought that the Indian pilots were given instructions to fly despite the fact that the entire Pakistani air defence was on high alert and their jets were already in the sky. The IAF hasn't given details of the mission or about its air operations strategy.Beijing also hasn't made any comment on reports of the J-10 taking down Indian fighter jets, including the Rafale. But unconfirmed reports of the J-10 bringing down a Western weapon system has triggered jubilation and triumphalism on Chinese social media.Carlotta Rinaudo, a China researcher at the International Team for the Study of Security in Verona, said Chinese social media was flooded with nationalistic messages even though it's difficult to reach a conclusion with the available information.""At the moment perception matters way more than reality. If we see it in that way, the main winner is really China,"" she said.For China, Pakistan is a strategic and economic ally. It is investing more than $50bn (£37bn) to build infrastructure in Pakistan as part of its China-Pakistan Economic corridor.So, a weak Pakistan is not in China's interest.China made a critical difference in the latest India-Pakistan conflict, says Imtiaz Gul, a Pakistani security analyst. ""It took the Indian planners by sheer surprise. They didn't probably envision the depth of co-operation in the modern warfare between Pakistan and China,"" he said.Experts say the performance of the Chinese jets in a real combat situation was keenly analysed in Western capitals as this will have cascading impact on global arms trade. The US is the world's largest arms exporter, while China is the fourth.China sells weapons mostly to developing countries like Myanmar and Pakistan. Previously the Chinese weapon systems were criticised for their poor quality and technical problems.Reports said the Burmese military grounded several of its JF-17 fighter jets – jointly manufactured by China and Pakistan in 2022 – due to technical malfunctions.The Nigerian military reported several technical problems with the Chinese made F-7 fighter jets.Another point to be noted is that this was not the first time that India lost an aircraft to Pakistan.In 2019, during a brief air battle between the two sides following similar Indian air strikes on suspected terrorist targets in Pakistan, a Russian-made MiG-21 jet was shot down inside Pakistani territory and the pilot was captured. He was released a few days later.India, however, said that the pilot had ejected after successfully shooting down Pakistani fighter jets, including a US-made F-16. Pakistan has denied the claim.Despite reports of the downing of Indian jets last week, experts like Mr Ladwig argue that India was able to hit an ""impressive breadth of targets"" inside Pakistan early in the morning of 10 May and this fact has gone largely unnoticed by the international media.The Indian military said in a co-ordinated attack, it launched missiles on 11 Pakistani air bases across the country, including the strategic Nur Khan air base outside Rawalpindi, not far from the Pakistani military headquarters. It's a sensitive target that took Islamabad by surprise.One of the furthest targets was in Bholari, 140km (86 miles) from the southern city of Karachi.Mr Ladwig says this time the IAF operated with standard procedures - first attacking Pakistani air defence and radar systems and then focusing on ground targets.The Indian jets used an array of missiles, loitering munitions and drones despite the Pakistanis operating the Chinese-provided HQ 9 air defence system.""It seems the attacks were relatively precise and targeted. The craters were in the middle of runways, exactly the ideal spot. If it were a longer conflict, how long would it take the Pakistani Air Force to get these facilities up and running again, I can't say,"" Mr Ladwig pointed out.Nevertheless, he said, by refusing to get into the details of the mission briefing, India's military ""lost control of the narrative thread"".In response to the Indian strikes, Pakistan said it launched missile and air strikes on several Indian forward air bases, but Delhi said the attacks caused no damage to equipment and personnel.Realising that the situation was getting out of control, the US and its allies intervened and put pressure on both countries to stop the fighting.But for India, experts say, the whole episode is a wake-up call.Beijing may not comment on the details of the recent India-Pakistan conflict, but it's keen to show that its weapon systems are fast catching up with the West.Delhi is aware that the jets China has supplied to Pakistan are some of the earlier models. Beijing has already inducted the more advanced J-20 stealth fighter jets, that can evade radars.India and China have a long-standing border dispute along the Himalayas and fought a brief border war in 1962 that resulted in a defeat for India. A brief border clash took place in Ladakh in June 2020.Experts say India is acutely aware that it needs to accelerate investments in its homegrown defence manufacturing industry and speed up international buying.For now, China's defence industry seems to be enjoying the limelight following the claims of success of one of its aircraft in the India-Pakistan conflict.Follow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook",Operation Sindoor,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1w3dln352vo,BBC,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""framing"", ""reason"": ""The article frames the conflict as a 'win' for China's defence industry, highlighting its success in a real combat situation and implying that it has surpassed Western weapon systems."", ""confidence"": 0.8}",yes,framing," frames the conflict as a 'win' for China's defence industry, highlighting its success in a real combat situation and implying that it has surpassed Western weapon system"
101,Relief in Kashmir - but BBC hears from families on both sides mourning the dead,"Sixteen-year-old Nimra stood outside, rooted to the spot, as the Indian missiles that had woken her a moment ago rained down on the mosque a few metres from her house in Pakistan-administered Kashmir. She watched one tear the minaret off the top of the building. But she failed to realise she, too, had been struck - in the chest.When the family reached the relative safety of her aunt's house nearby, someone turned on a phone torch. ""My aunt gasped. There was blood on my frock. It was pink and white but now soaked in red. I hadn't seen it before."" Again they ran. ""I was running but my hand was pressed on my chest the whole time. I didn't want to take it off. I thought if I let go, everything inside me would come out."" A piece of shrapnel was lodged near her heart, she later discovered.A few hours later, in Poonch, Indian-administered Kashmir, a different family was dodging shelling which Pakistan had launched in response to India's missile strikes.""When the firing began, everyone ran for their lives - children clinging to their parents in fear,"" said MN Sudhan, 72. ""Some families managed to leave for Jammu in their vehicles. We also decided to escape. But barely 10 minutes into our journey, a shell landed near our vehicle. The shrapnel tore through the car. My grandson died on the spot.""""Our future was shattered at that [very] moment,"" Mr Sudhan said of 13-year-old Vihaan's death. ""Now we're left with nothing but grief. I have witnessed two wars between India and Pakistan, but never in my life have I seen shelling as intense as this.""Nimra and Vihaan were among many of the villagers caught up in the deadliest attacks for several years in a decades-long conflict between two of the world's nuclear powers - India and Pakistan. Both sides administer the Himalayan region in part but claim it in full. Both governments deny targeting civilians, but BBC journalists in the region have spoken to families caught up in the violence.The strike that injured Nimra was part of India's armed response after a militant attack killed 26 people - mostly Indian tourists - last month at a beauty spot in India-administered Kashmir. Police there claimed militants included at least two Pakistan nationals. Pakistan has asked India for evidence of this, and has called for an independent inquiry into who was behind the attack.What followed was four days of tit-for-tat shelling and drone attacks, intensifying each day and culminating in missile strikes on military bases, which threatened to tip over into full-blown conflict. Then, suddenly, a ceasefire brokered by the US and other international players on 10 May brought the two nuclear powers back from the brink.Families on both sides of the Line of Control (LoC) - the de facto border in Kashmir - told us they had had loved ones killed and property destroyed. At least 16 people are reported to have been killed on the Indian side, while Pakistan claims 40 civilian deaths, though it remains unclear how many were directly caused by the shelling. We also heard from Indian and Pakistani government insiders about the mood in their respective administrations as the conflict escalated.In Delhi's corridors of power, the atmosphere was initially jubilant, an Indian government source told the BBC. Its missile attacks on targets in Pakistan-administered Kashmir and in Pakistan itself - including the Bilal Mosque in Muzaff arabad, which India claims is a militant camp, though Pakistan denies this - were deemed a success.""The strikes… were not limited to Pakistani-administered Kashmir or along the Line of Control,"" an Indian government source told the BBC. ""We went deep - even into the Pakistani side of Punjab, which has always been Pakistan's red line.""But the Pakistani military had been prepared, a source from the Pakistan Air Force told the BBC. Days earlier, the Pakistani government said it was expecting an attack.""We knew something was coming, and we were absolutely ready,"" one officer said, speaking on condition of anonymity. He said Indian fighter jets approached Pakistani territory and the air force was under instructions to shoot down any that crossed into its airspace or dropped a payload.Pakistan claims to have shot down five Indian jets that night, something India has remained silent on.""We were well prepared, and honestly, we were also lucky,"" the source said - his account repeated by two other sources.But Mr Sudhan, Vihaan's grandfather, said there had been no warning to stay indoors or evacuate. ""Why didn't they inform us? We, the people, are caught in the middle.""It is likely that no evacuation orders had been issued because the Indian government needed to keep the military strikes confidential, though the local administration had, following the April militant attack, directed locals to clean out community bunkers as a precautionary measure.A day after the initial missile strikes, Thursday, both sides launched drone attacks, though they each accused the other of making the first move.India began to evacuate thousands of villagers along the Indian side of the LoC. Just after 21:00 that evening, the Khan family in India-administered Kashmir decided they must flee their home in Uri, 270km (168 miles) to the north of Poonch. Most of their neighbours had already left.But after travelling for just 10 minutes, their vehicle was struck by shrapnel from a shell, fatally injuring 47-year-old Nargis. Her sister-in-law Hafeeza was seriously injured. They headed to the nearest hospital, only to find the gates locked.""I somehow climbed the hospital wall and called out for help, telling them we had injured people with us. Only then did the staff come out and open the gate. As soon as they did, I collapsed. The doctors were terrified by the ongoing shelling and had closed everything out of fear,"" Hafeeza said.Hafeeza's sister-in-law Nargis is survived by six children. The youngest daughter Sanam, 20, said the first hospital they went to was not equipped to help, and as they headed to another, her mother died of her injuries.""A piece of shrapnel had torn through her face. My clothes were soaked in her blood… We kept talking to her, urging her to stay with us. But she passed away on the way.""Since a ceasefire agreement between India and Pakistan in 2021 there had been relative peace in the region, locals told the BBC. For the first time in years, they had been able to live normal lives, they said, and now this sense of security was destroyed.Sanam, who lost her mother, said: ""I appeal to both governments - if you're heading into war, at least secure your civilians. Prepare... Those who sit in comfort and demand war - they should be sent to the borders. Let them witness what it really means. Let them lose someone before their eyes.""Sajjad Shafi, the representative for Uri in the regional government, said he had acted as promptly as possible.""The moment I got the news that India has attacked, I got in touch with people and started moving them out.""After two days of attacks and counter attacks, the Indian government source said there was now a ""clear sense in… power corridors that things were escalating but we were ready.""We were ready because India had spent the last 10 years acquiring and building strategic military assets - missiles, warheads and defence systems.""On the international stage, there had been consternation that the tensions would not be de-escalated by the US, despite its diplomatic overtures during India and Pakistan's previous Kashmir clashes.US Vice President JD Vance said a potential war would be ""none of our business"".This statement came as no surprise, the Indian government source told the BBC. At that stage, ""it was clear the US didn't want to get involved"".By the following day, Friday, shelling had become more intense.Muhammed Shafi was at home with his wife in Shahkot village in the Neelum Valley, Pakistan-administered Kashmir, on the LoC.The 30-year-old was standing in the doorway, just a few steps away from where his son was playing; his wife standing in their courtyard.""I remember looking up and seeing a mortar shell coming from a distance. In the blink of an eye, it struck her. She didn't even have time to scream. One second she was there, and the next, she was gone. Her face... her head... there was nothing left. Just a cloud of smoke and dust. My ears went numb. Everything went silent. I didn't even realise I was screaming.""That night, her body lay there, right in our home. The entire village was hiding in bunkers. The shelling continued all night, and I stayed beside her, weeping. I held her hand for as long as I could.""One of those in a bunker was his niece, 18-year-old Umaima. She and her family were holed up in the shelter for four days, on and off, in brutal conditions.""There were six or seven of us packed into it,"" she said. ""The other bunker was already full. There's no place to lie down in there - some people stood, others sat. There was no drinking water, no food,"" with people shouting, crying and reciting prayers in the pitch black.Also in a bunker, in the Leepa Valley, Pakistan-Administered Kashmir - one of the most militarised and vulnerable valleys in the region - was Shams Ur Rehman and family. It is Shams's own bunker, but that night he shared it with 36 other people, he said.Leepa is surrounded on three sides by the LoC and Indian-administered territory, so Shams was used to living with cross-border tensions. But he was not prepared for the complete destruction of his house.He left the bunker at three in the morning to survey the scene.""Everything was gone. Wooden beams and debris from the house were scattered everywhere. The blast was so powerful, the shockwave pushed in the main wall. The metal sheets on the roof were shredded. The entire structure shifted - by at least two inches.""A house is a person's life's work. You're always trying to improve it - but in the end, it's all gone in seconds.""Four hours later, back in the Neelum Valley, Umaima and her family also emerged on Saturday 10 May to a transformed landscape.""We came out of the bunker at seven in the morning. That's when we saw - nothing was left.""As Umaima surveyed the ruins of her village, India and Pakistan's forces that day were trading ever more destructive blows - firing missiles at each other's military installations, which both sides accused the other of instigating.India had targeted three Pakistani air bases, including one in Rawalpindi - the garrison city that houses the Pakistan Army's General Headquarters.""This was a red line crossed,"" said one Pakistani officer. ""The prime minister gave the go-ahead to the army chief. We already had a plan, and our forces were desperately ready to execute it… For anyone in uniform, it was one of those unforgettable days.""Pakistan hit back at Indian military installations. On the diplomatic front, this was seen as a moment to highlight the issue of Kashmir on the international stage, an official in the Pakistan foreign office told the BBC.""It was non-stop. Endless meetings, coordination, and back-to-back calls to and from other countries for both foreign minister and then the prime minister. We welcomed mediation offers from the US, the Saudis, the Iranians, or anyone who could help de-escalate.""On the Indian side, the Pahalgam attack on 22 April had already prompted External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar to speak to at least 17 world leaders or diplomats, including UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. In most of these conversations, he has tweeted, the emphasis had been on the ""cross-border terrorist attack"" and focused on building a case to hold the perpetrators accountable for the attack.Then, on Saturday afternoon local time, in the aftermath of the latest missile exchanges, came a diplomatic breakthrough out of nowhere. US President Donald Trump took to social media to reveal that a ceasefire had been agreed.""After a long night of talks mediated by the United States, I am pleased to announce that India and Pakistan have agreed to a FULL AND IMMEDIATE CEASEFIRE.""Congratulations to both Countries on using Common Sense and Great Intelligence,"" he wrote on social media platform Truth Social.India has since downplayed Washington's role in the ceasefire and it has rejected that trade was used as a lever to achieve this.Behind the scenes, US mediators, diplomatic backchannels and regional players, including the US, the UK and Saudi Arabia, had proved critical in negotiating the climbdown, experts say.""We hit Pakistani strategic bases deep inside their territory and that must have worried the US,"" the Indian government source believes.In Pahalgam, the site of the militant gun attack that sparked the crisis, the search is still on for the perpetrators.Vinay Narwal, a 26-year-old Indian Navy officer, was on his honeymoon in Pahalgam when he was killed. He had got married just a week before the attack.A photo of Vinay's wife Himanshi, sitting near her husband's body following the attack, has been widely shared on social media.His grandfather Hawa Singh Narwal wants ""exemplary punishment"" for the killers.""This terrorism should end. Today, I lost my grandson. Tomorrow, someone else will lose their loved one,"" he said.A witness to the attack's aftermath, Rayees Ahmad Bhat, who used to lead pony treks to the beauty spot where the shootings took place, said his industry was now in ruins.""The attackers may have killed tourists that day, but we - the people of Pahalgam - are dying every day since. They've stained the name of this peaceful town… Pahalgam is terrorised, and its people broken.""The attack was a huge shock for a government which had begun to actively promote tourism in stunningly picturesque Kashmir, famed for its lush valleys, lakes and snow-capped mountains.The source in the Indian administration said this might have lulled Delhi into a false sense of security.""Perhaps we got carried away by the response to tourism in Kashmir. We thought we were over a hump but we were not.""The four-day conflict has once again shown how fragile peace can be between the two nations.Additional reporting by Vikas Pandey in Delhi",Operation Sindoor,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgvr4r5d2qo,BBC,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""framing"", ""reason"": ""The article presents a balanced view of the conflict from both Indian and Pakistani perspectives, but frames India's actions as 'armed response' and 'missile strikes', while Pakistan's actions are described as 'shelling'"", ""confidence"": 0.8}",no,none,no framing bias
102,How India and Pakistan share one of the world's most dangerous borders,"To live along the Line of Control (LoC) - the volatile de facto border that separates India and Pakistan - is to exist perpetually on the razor's edge between fragile peace and open conflict.The recent escalation after the Pahalgam attack brought India and Pakistan to the brink once again. Shells rained down on both sides of the LoC, turning homes to rubble and lives into statistics. At least 16 people were reportedly killed on the Indian side, while Pakistan claims 40 civilian deaths, though it remains unclear how many were directly caused by the shelling.""Families on the LoC are subjected to Indian and Pakistani whims and face the brunt of heated tensions,"" Anam Zakaria, a Pakistani writer based in Canada, told the BBC.""Each time firing resumes many are thrust into bunkers, livestock and livelihood is lost, infrastructure - homes, hospitals, schools - is damaged. The vulnerability and volatility experienced has grave repercussions for their everyday lived reality,"" Ms Zakaria, author of a book on Pakistan-administered Kashmir, said.India and Pakistan share a 3,323km (2,064-mile) border, including the 740km-long LoC; and the International Border (IB), spanning roughly 2,400km. The LoC began as the Ceasefire Line in 1949 after the first India-Pakistan war, and was renamed under the 1972 Simla Agreement.The LoC cutting through Kashmir - claimed in full and administered in parts by both India and Pakistan - remains one of the most militarised borders in the world. Conflict is never far behind and ceasefires are only as durable as the next provocation.Ceasefire violations here can range from ""low-level firing to major land grabbing to surgical strikes"", says Happymon Jacob, a foreign policy expert at Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU). (A land grab could involve seizing key positions such as hilltops, outposts, or buffer zones by force.)The LoC, many experts say, is a classic example of a ""border drawn in blood, forged through conflict"". It is also a line, as Ms Zakaria says, ""carved by India and Pakistan, and militarised and weaponised, without taking Kashmiris into account"".Such wartime borders aren't unique to South Asia. Sumantra Bose, professor of international and comparative politics at Krea University in India and author of Kashmir at the Crossroads: Inside a 21st-Century Conflict, says the  most well-known is the 'Green Line'  - the ceasefire line of 1949 - which is the generally recognised boundary between Israel and the West Bank.Not surprisingly, the tentative calm along the LoC that had endured since the 2021 ceasefire agreement between the two nuclear-armed neighbours crumbled easily after the latest hostilities.""The current escalation on the LoC and International Border (IB) is significant as it follows a four-year period of relative peace on the border,"" Surya Valliappan Krishna of Carnegie India told the BBC.Violence along the India-Pakistan border is not new - prior to the 2003 ceasefire, India reported 4,134 violations in 2001 and 5,767 in 2002.The 2003 ceasefire initially held, with negligible violations from 2004 to 2007, but tensions resurfaced in 2008 and escalated sharply by 2013.Between 2013 and early 2021, the LoC and the IB witnessed sustained high levels of conflict. A renewed ceasefire in February 2021 led to an immediate and sustained drop in violations through to March 2025.""During periods of intense cross-border firing we've seen border populations in the many thousands be displaced for months on end,"" says Mr Krishna. Between late September and early December 2016, more than 27,000 people were displaced from border areas due to ceasefire violations and cross-border firing.It's looking increasingly hairy and uncertain now.Tensions flared after the Pahalgam attack, with India suspending the key water-sharing treaty between India and Pakistan, known as the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT). Pakistan responded by threatening to exit the 1972 Simla Agreement, which formalised the LoC - though it hasn't followed through yet.""This is significant because the Simla Agreement is the basis of the current LoC, which both sides agreed to not alter unilaterally in spite of their political differences,"" says Mr Krishna.Mr Jacob says for some ""curious reason"", ceasefire violations along the LoC have been absent from discussions and debates about escalation of conflict between the two countries.""It is itself puzzling how the regular use of high-calibre weapons such as 105mm mortars, 130 and 155mm artillery guns and anti-tank guided missiles by two nuclear-capable countries, which has led to civilian and military casualties, has escaped scholarly scrutiny and policy attention,"" Mr Jacob writes in his book, Line On Fire: Ceasefire Violations and India-Pakistan Escalation Dynamics.Mr Jacob identifies two main triggers for the violations: Pakistan often uses cover fire to facilitate militant infiltration into Indian-administered Kashmir, which has witnessed an armed insurgency against Indian rule for over three decades. Pakistan, in turn, accuses India of unprovoked firing on civilian areas.He argues that ceasefire violations along the India-Pakistan border are less the product of high-level political strategy and more the result of local military dynamics.The hostilities are often initiated by field commanders - sometimes with, but often without, central approval. He also challenges the notion that the Pakistan Army alone drives the violations, pointing instead to a complex mix of local military imperatives and autonomy granted to border forces on both sides.Some experts believe It's time to revisit an idea shelved nearly two decades ago: turning the LoC into a formal, internationally recognised border. Others insist that possibility was never realistic - and still isn't.""The idea is completely infeasible, a dead end. For decades, Indian maps have shown the entire territory of the erstwhile princely state of Jammu and Kashmir as part of India,"" Sumantra Bose told the BBC.""For Pakistan, making the LoC part of the International Border would mean settling the Kashmir dispute - which is Pakistan's equivalent of the Holy Grail - on India's preferred terms. Every Pakistani government and leader, civilian or military, over the past seven decades has rejected this.""In his 2003 book, Kashmir: Roots of Conflict, Paths to Peace, Prof Bose writes: ""A Kashmir settlement necessitates that the LoC be transformed - from an iron curtain of barbed wire, bunkers, trenches and hostile militaries to a linen curtain. Realpolitik dictates that the border will be permanent (albeit probably under a different name), but it must be transcended without being abolished.""""I stressed, though, that such a transformation of the LoC must be embedded in a broader Kashmir settlement, as one pillar of a multi-pillared settlement,"" he told the BBC.Between 2004 and 2007, turning the LoC into a soft border was central to a fledgling India-Pakistan peace process on Kashmir - a process that ultimately fell apart.Today, the border has reignited, bringing back the cycle of violence and uncertainty for those who live in its shadow.""You never know what will happen next.

103,India says it killed militants who shot dead tourists in Kashmir,"India has said its security forces killed three militants who shot dead 26 civilians near a tourist town in Indian-administered Kashmir in April, triggering a brief military conflict with Pakistan.Home Minister Amit Shah told parliament the men had been killed by Indian forces near the disputed region's main city Srinagar on Monday.He claimed the attackers were Pakistani nationals, a charge Islamabad denies. The men's identity was confirmed through forensic and ballistic tests, Shah told MPs.Pakistan has not commented on the claims, which have not been independently confirmed and come amid mounting criticism of India's government for alleged security lapses in Kashmir.Twenty-six men, mostly Hindu tourists, were killed by gunmen who opened fire at a mountain meadow not far from the scenic town of Pahalgam on 22 April, in one of the deadliest attacks in the region in recent years.The victims were killed in cold blood in front of their wives and family members. A local Muslim pony handler who tried to help them was also shot dead.Delhi accused Islamabad of supporting militant groups involved in the attack - a charge Pakistan has repeatedly denied. In May, India launched a series of strikes on sites in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir.Pakistan responded with drones, missiles and fighter jets, leading to four days of intense military action from both sides.Dozens of people were killed in the bloodiest confrontation between India and Pakistan in decades, before US President Donald Trump announced a ceasefire between them.India's opposition leaders have accused the government of ""severe security lapses"" and have been questioning why it has taken this much time to catch the attackers.In parliament on Monday, Congress MP Gaurav Gogoi demanded that Shah should personally take responsibility for the attack.""The country wants to know why the government has not been able to nab the terrorists even after 100 days since the attack,"" he said.Shah responded on Tuesday, saying that security forces had ""neutralised the three terrorists"" involved in the attack in a mission called ""Operation Mahadev"".The three died in a gun battle in a wildlife reserve in the mountains of Dachigam, about 30km (18 miles) from Srinagar, the Indian army said on Monday. The clash could not be independently confirmed by the BBC. The army did not immediately identify those it killed.But on Tuesday, Shah claimed the men - who he identified as Suleiman Shah, Afghan and Jibran - were Pakistani nationals.""When the terrorists were killed [on Monday], we recovered three rifles - one M9 American rifle and two AK-47s. The cartridges we had collected were also from an M9 and AK-47. We sent the rifles last night to the central forensics lab in Chandigarh where they fired them, and these were then compared and it was confirmed these were the three rifles used in the attack to kill our innocent citizens,"" Shah said.""I have the ballistic report,"" he told the house, holding up some papers. ""Six scientists have cross verified it. They told me this morning on a video call these are 100% the bullets that they had fired.""At the beginning of the investigation in May, Indian police had issued sketches of three men, saying two were Pakistanis while one was a local man.But in June, Indian investigators said all three militants were Pakistani nationals from the UN-proscribed militant group Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) after it arrested two locals for allegedly sheltering the suspected militants prior to the attack.However, on Tuesday, Shah clarified that only two men - Suleiman Shah and Afghan - were believed to be LeT members. He did not say which group the Indian authorities thought the third militant Jibran was associated with.The militants were identified by locals who had provided them shelter, he claimed.""We have voter ID numbers of the two of them, we have weapons recovered from them. The chocolates recovered from them are also made in Pakistan,"" Shah said.""They killed our tourists and now they have been killed.""Shah also defended the speed of the investigation amid questions on how the three men had managed to remain undetected over the past three months.""Right after the attack, we handed over the investigation to the National Investigation Agency (NIA),"" he said.""We made all arrangements with the security and border forces to ensure they [culprits] couldn't leave the country.""Some opposition leaders, however, remained unconvinced and questioned the lack of security in Pahalgam on the day of the attack.""Why was not even one security personnel present there?""

104,Indian investigators now claim all Pahalgam attackers were Pakistan nationals,"Indian investigators say all three militants involved in April's deadly attack on tourists near Indian-administered Kashmir's Pahalgam town were Pakistani nationals from the UN-proscribed militant group Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT).Police had earlier issued sketches of three men saying two were Pakistanis while one was a local man.The claim by the National Investigative Agency (NIA) came after it arrested two local men for allegedly sheltering the attackers. Pakistan has not commented on these claims.It had earlier rejected involvement in the attacks in which 26 people were killed. The attack in Baisaran, a popular tourist spot, had brought  India and Pakistan on the brink of war.The nuclear-armed South Asian neighbours, who have fought three wars over Kashmir, claim the region in full but administer it in parts.The killings on 22 April had sent shockwaves through India and the case was handed over to NIA, a federal investigative agency.Security forces had launched a major search and combing operation in the region and thousands were detained across Kashmir for questioning.The three attackers are, however, yet to be caught.In a statement on Sunday, NIA said the arrested men had ""knowingly harboured the three armed terrorists at a seasonal dhol (hut)"" before the 22 April attack. It did not give details of when the arrests took place and as those arrested are in custody, they have not made any statement.A little-known group, The Resistance Front (TRF), allied with the Lashkar-e-Taiba, had initially said it was behind the attack but later disowned it.Within days of the attack, India revoked the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty, a long-standing water-sharing agreement with Pakistan. Islamabad, in turn, withdrew from the 1972 Simla agreement that sought to settle differences through bilateral negotiations and peaceful means.India followed it by launching air and missile attacks on 7 May, targeting sites it called ""terror infrastructure in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir"".Pakistan denied the claim that these were terror camps and also responded by firing missiles and deploying drones into Indian territory.The hostilities between the two countries continued until 10 May when US President Donald Trump announced a ceasefire.Follow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook",Operation Sindoor,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c36xe95g06zo,BBC,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""source"", ""reason"": ""The article relies on Indian investigators' claims without providing a direct quote or statement from Pakistan's side, despite mentioning that Pakistan has not commented on these claims."", ""confidence"": 0.8}",no,none,no source bias

""My eyes just kept searching for my son.""Only the most serious cases were airlifted to the Combined Military Hospital. The military have said the death toll has now risen to eight, with six children killed and dozens injured.

The military said they wanted international media to witness the impact of the attack themselves.Pakistan alleges India is linked to the attack, though there is no independent evidence - and it is a claim Delhi firmly denies.India and Pakistan are in the midst of a fragile ceasefire, after a two-week conflict that was their most significant one in decades. It saw them exchange drone attacks, missiles and artillery fire, and left dozens of casualties.This attack in Balochistan is now in the middle of the tensions, with news channels broadcasting pictures of the children who were killed, most of them girls between the ages of 12 and 16, alongside accusations of an ""Indian terror campaign"". Images of scrapped metal, children's shoes and abandoned backpacks strewn along the scene highlight the tragedy.As we walked through the intensive care unit, some children lay unconscious on their beds, others thrashed in pain. One young girl kept calling out for her mother as nurses tried to calm her. Doctors told us several children were in critical condition, having suffered extensive trauma, burns and fractured bones. The night before we arrived, another child had died.Pakistan's Minister of Information, Attaullah Tarar, says there is a history of Indian proxies operating in Balochistan. In turn, India says that Pakistan has been harbouring militants who wage attacks on Indian-administered Kashmir for years.The killing of 26 people in April, most of them tourists in Pahalgam, sparked the most recent conflict. Pakistan has called for an open investigation led by an independent party.However, Tarar denied that such an investigation was necessary in Balochistan.""Pahalgam was a one-off incident,"" he told us. ""We are the victims in this case. We have been suffering. There is a history. We have evidence. So what can I say?""When we asked him what that evidence was, he once again pointed to claims of a history of attacks.  He gave us no other details of India's alleged involvement in this attack.Later, an officer drove us through Quetta's roads in a bus flanked by soldiers carrying rifles and ammunition hanging from their pockets.Balochistan has experienced decades of militant attacks linked to a nationalist insurgency. It is home to several groups which accuse the government of exploiting its natural resources.In March, some 21 people, most of them off-duty security personnel, were killed during a train siege in Balochistan's remote Sibi district.That attack was carried out by the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA).Pakistan, as well as several Western countries, including the UK and US, have designated the BLA as a terrorist organisation.As the military responds to the insurgency, activists in Balochistan accuse Pakistan's security forces of human rights violations. They say thousands of ethnic Baloch people have been disappeared in the last two decades, and are allegedly detained without due legal process.The minister of information told us the government believed ""faceless courts"" might be needed in the province, hiding the identities of the judges and prosecutors in terror cases. Tarar said the courts often fail to convict the accused, because of a fear of retribution from militant groups.In a press conference, the military spokesperson, Lt Gen Chaudhry, said the school bus attack  ""had nothing to do with the Baloch identity, rather it was just India's provocation"".The government says it is raising the issue ""across diplomatic channels"" around the world.The impact on the ceasefire and on the prospect of talks between India and Pakistan remains to be seen.Additional reporting by Malik Mudassir",Operation Sindoor,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx27nx0j1kjo,BBC,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""source"", ""reason"": ""The article relies heavily on Pakistani sources and perspectives, including the Minister of Information Attaullah Tarar, while only mentioning Indian denials without providing counter-evidence or credible sources."", ""confidence"": 0.8}",yes,source,"relies heavily on Pakistani sources and perspectives, including the Minister of Information Attaullah Tarar, while only mentioning Indian denials without providing counter-evidence or credible sources"
106,School bus attack kills at least five in Pakistan,"A bomb attack on a school bus in Pakistan's Balochistan region has killed at least five people and injured dozens.The bus was carrying around 40 school children when it exploded at about 07:40 local time (02:40 GMT) just outside the remote town of Khuzdar, police told the BBC.Three of the five people killed are children, police said. Pictures circulating on social media show the charred wreckage of a large bus, with backpacks scattered around it.No group has claimed responsibility for the incident so far, but Balochistan, a turbulent province in the country's south west, has been plagued by a long-standing insurgency and human rights violations.Pakistan's Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi condemned the incident as ""sheer barbarism"", calling the attackers ""beasts who target children"" in an attempt to destabilise the country.Its military has accused neighbouring India and its proxies in Balochistan of orchestrating the explosion, though there is no evidence of this.Pakistan and India are just emerging from a deadly two-week conflict sparked by a militant attack on tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir.Pakistan denied involvement in those attacks, but India followed up with a series of strikes on sites in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir.Earlier in March, some 21 civilians and four military personnel were killed during a train siege in Balochistan's remote Sibi district.That attack was carried out by the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), a separatist group that has waged a decades-long insurgency to gain independence.Pakistani authorities, as well as several Western countries, including the UK and US, have designated the BLA as a terrorist organisation.The country's military has also previously accused it of being an ""Indian proxy"" - a claim that the BLA has rejected.But Baloch activists have also accused Pakistan's security forces of its own atrocities.They say thousands of ethnic Baloch people have been disappeared by Pakistan's security forces in the last two decades - allegedly detained without due legal process, or abducted, tortured and killed in operations against a decades-old separatist insurgency.Additional reporting by Usman Zahid in Islamabad",Operation Sindoor,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c70nnklwgpzo,BBC,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""source"", ""reason"": ""The article relies on Pakistani authorities' and Western countries' designations of the BLA as a terrorist organization, but does not provide a counter-perspective from Baloch activists."", ""confidence"": 0.8}",no,none,no source bias
107,Relief in Kashmir - but BBC hears from families on both sides mourning the dead,"Sixteen-year-old Nimra stood outside, rooted to the spot, as the Indian missiles that had woken her a moment ago rained down on the mosque a few metres from her house in Pakistan-administered Kashmir. She watched one tear the minaret off the top of the building. But she failed to realise she, too, had been struck - in the chest.When the family reached the relative safety of her aunt's house nearby, someone turned on a phone torch. ""My aunt gasped. There was blood on my frock. It was pink and white but now soaked in red. I hadn't seen it before."" Again they ran. ""I was running but my hand was pressed on my chest the whole time. I didn't want to take it off. I thought if I let go, everything inside me would come out."" A piece of shrapnel was lodged near her heart, she later discovered.A few hours later, in Poonch, Indian-administered Kashmir, a different family was dodging shelling which Pakistan had launched in response to India's missile strikes.""When the firing began, everyone ran for their lives - children clinging to their parents in fear,"" said MN Sudhan, 72. ""Some families managed to leave for Jammu in their vehicles. We also decided to escape. But barely 10 minutes into our journey, a shell landed near our vehicle. The shrapnel tore through the car. My grandson died on the spot.""""Our future was shattered at that [very] moment,"" Mr Sudhan said of 13-year-old Vihaan's death. ""Now we're left with nothing but grief. I have witnessed two wars between India and Pakistan, but never in my life have I seen shelling as intense as this.""Nimra and Vihaan were among many of the villagers caught up in the deadliest attacks for several years in a decades-long conflict between two of the world's nuclear powers - India and Pakistan. Both sides administer the Himalayan region in part but claim it in full. Both governments deny targeting civilians, but BBC journalists in the region have spoken to families caught up in the violence.The strike that injured Nimra was part of India's armed response after a militant attack killed 26 people - mostly Indian tourists - last month at a beauty spot in India-administered Kashmir. Police there claimed militants included at least two Pakistan nationals. Pakistan has asked India for evidence of this, and has called for an independent inquiry into who was behind the attack.What followed was four days of tit-for-tat shelling and drone attacks, intensifying each day and culminating in missile strikes on military bases, which threatened to tip over into full-blown conflict. Then, suddenly, a ceasefire brokered by the US and other international players on 10 May brought the two nuclear powers back from the brink.Families on both sides of the Line of Control (LoC) - the de facto border in Kashmir - told us they had had loved ones killed and property destroyed. At least 16 people are reported to have been killed on the Indian side, while Pakistan claims 40 civilian deaths, though it remains unclear how many were directly caused by the shelling. We also heard from Indian and Pakistani government insiders about the mood in their respective administrations as the conflict escalated.In Delhi's corridors of power, the atmosphere was initially jubilant, an Indian government source told the BBC. Its missile attacks on targets in Pakistan-administered Kashmir and in Pakistan itself - including the Bilal Mosque in Muzaff arabad, which India claims is a militant camp, though Pakistan denies this - were deemed a success.""The strikes… were not limited to Pakistani-administered Kashmir or along the Line of Control,"" an Indian government source told the BBC. ""We went deep - even into the Pakistani side of Punjab, which has always been Pakistan's red line.""But the Pakistani military had been prepared, a source from the Pakistan Air Force told the BBC. Days earlier, the Pakistani government said it was expecting an attack.""We knew something was coming, and we were absolutely ready,"" one officer said, speaking on condition of anonymity. He said Indian fighter jets approached Pakistani territory and the air force was under instructions to shoot down any that crossed into its airspace or dropped a payload.Pakistan claims to have shot down five Indian jets that night, something India has remained silent on.""We were well prepared, and honestly, we were also lucky,"" the source said - his account repeated by two other sources.But Mr Sudhan, Vihaan's grandfather, said there had been no warning to stay indoors or evacuate. ""Why didn't they inform us? We, the people, are caught in the middle.""It is likely that no evacuation orders had been issued because the Indian government needed to keep the military strikes confidential, though the local administration had, following the April militant attack, directed locals to clean out community bunkers as a precautionary measure.A day after the initial missile strikes, Thursday, both sides launched drone attacks, though they each accused the other of making the first move.India began to evacuate thousands of villagers along the Indian side of the LoC. Just after 21:00 that evening, the Khan family in India-administered Kashmir decided they must flee their home in Uri, 270km (168 miles) to the north of Poonch. Most of their neighbours had already left.But after travelling for just 10 minutes, their vehicle was struck by shrapnel from a shell, fatally injuring 47-year-old Nargis. Her sister-in-law Hafeeza was seriously injured. They headed to the nearest hospital, only to find the gates locked.""I somehow climbed the hospital wall and called out for help, telling them we had injured people with us. Only then did the staff come out and open the gate. As soon as they did, I collapsed. The doctors were terrified by the ongoing shelling and had closed everything out of fear,"" Hafeeza said.Hafeeza's sister-in-law Nargis is survived by six children. The youngest daughter Sanam, 20, said the first hospital they went to was not equipped to help, and as they headed to another, her mother died of her injuries.""A piece of shrapnel had torn through her face. My clothes were soaked in her blood… We kept talking to her, urging her to stay with us. But she passed away on the way.""Since a ceasefire agreement between India and Pakistan in 2021 there had been relative peace in the region, locals told the BBC. For the first time in years, they had been able to live normal lives, they said, and now this sense of security was destroyed.Sanam, who lost her mother, said: ""I appeal to both governments - if you're heading into war, at least secure your civilians. Prepare... Those who sit in comfort and demand war - they should be sent to the borders. Let them witness what it really means. Let them lose someone before their eyes.""Sajjad Shafi, the representative for Uri in the regional government, said he had acted as promptly as possible.""The moment I got the news that India has attacked, I got in touch with people and started moving them out.""After two days of attacks and counter attacks, the Indian government source said there was now a ""clear sense in… power corridors that things were escalating but we were ready.""We were ready because India had spent the last 10 years acquiring and building strategic military assets - missiles, warheads and defence systems.""On the international stage, there had been consternation that the tensions would not be de-escalated by the US, despite its diplomatic overtures during India and Pakistan's previous Kashmir clashes.US Vice President JD Vance said a potential war would be ""none of our business"".This statement came as no surprise, the Indian government source told the BBC. At that stage, ""it was clear the US didn't want to get involved"".By the following day, Friday, shelling had become more intense.Muhammed Shafi was at home with his wife in Shahkot village in the Neelum Valley, Pakistan-administered Kashmir, on the LoC.The 30-year-old was standing in the doorway, just a few steps away from where his son was playing; his wife standing in their courtyard.""I remember looking up and seeing a mortar shell coming from a distance. In the blink of an eye, it struck her. She didn't even have time to scream. One second she was there, and the next, she was gone. Her face... her head... there was nothing left. Just a cloud of smoke and dust. My ears went numb. Everything went silent. I didn't even realise I was screaming.""That night, her body lay there, right in our home. The entire village was hiding in bunkers. The shelling continued all night, and I stayed beside her, weeping. I held her hand for as long as I could.""One of those in a bunker was his niece, 18-year-old Umaima. She and her family were holed up in the shelter for four days, on and off, in brutal conditions.""There were six or seven of us packed into it,"" she said. ""The other bunker was already full. There's no place to lie down in there - some people stood, others sat. There was no drinking water, no food,"" with people shouting, crying and reciting prayers in the pitch black.Also in a bunker, in the Leepa Valley, Pakistan-Administered Kashmir - one of the most militarised and vulnerable valleys in the region - was Shams Ur Rehman and family. It is Shams's own bunker, but that night he shared it with 36 other people, he said.Leepa is surrounded on three sides by the LoC and Indian-administered territory, so Shams was used to living with cross-border tensions. But he was not prepared for the complete destruction of his house.He left the bunker at three in the morning to survey the scene.""Everything was gone. Wooden beams and debris from the house were scattered everywhere. The blast was so powerful, the shockwave pushed in the main wall. The metal sheets on the roof were shredded. The entire structure shifted - by at least two inches.""A house is a person's life's work. You're always trying to improve it - but in the end, it's all gone in seconds.""Four hours later, back in the Neelum Valley, Umaima and her family also emerged on Saturday 10 May to a transformed landscape.""We came out of the bunker at seven in the morning. That's when we saw - nothing was left.""As Umaima surveyed the ruins of her village, India and Pakistan's forces that day were trading ever more destructive blows - firing missiles at each other's military installations, which both sides accused the other of instigating.India had targeted three Pakistani air bases, including one in Rawalpindi - the garrison city that houses the Pakistan Army's General Headquarters.""This was a red line crossed,"" said one Pakistani officer. ""The prime minister gave the go-ahead to the army chief. We already had a plan, and our forces were desperately ready to execute it… For anyone in uniform, it was one of those unforgettable days.""Pakistan hit back at Indian military installations. On the diplomatic front, this was seen as a moment to highlight the issue of Kashmir on the international stage, an official in the Pakistan foreign office told the BBC.""It was non-stop. Endless meetings, coordination, and back-to-back calls to and from other countries for both foreign minister and then the prime minister. We welcomed mediation offers from the US, the Saudis, the Iranians, or anyone who could help de-escalate.""On the Indian side, the Pahalgam attack on 22 April had already prompted External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar to speak to at least 17 world leaders or diplomats, including UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. In most of these conversations, he has tweeted, the emphasis had been on the ""cross-border terrorist attack"" and focused on building a case to hold the perpetrators accountable for the attack.Then, on Saturday afternoon local time, in the aftermath of the latest missile exchanges, came a diplomatic breakthrough out of nowhere. US President Donald Trump took to social media to reveal that a ceasefire had been agreed.""After a long night of talks mediated by the United States, I am pleased to announce that India and Pakistan have agreed to a FULL AND IMMEDIATE CEASEFIRE.""Congratulations to both Countries on using Common Sense and Great Intelligence,"" he wrote on social media platform Truth Social.India has since downplayed Washington's role in the ceasefire and it has rejected that trade was used as a lever to achieve this.Behind the scenes, US mediators, diplomatic backchannels and regional players, including the US, the UK and Saudi Arabia, had proved critical in negotiating the climbdown, experts say.""We hit Pakistani strategic bases deep inside their territory and that must have worried the US,"" the Indian government source believes.In Pahalgam, the site of the militant gun attack that sparked the crisis, the search is still on for the perpetrators.Vinay Narwal, a 26-year-old Indian Navy officer, was on his honeymoon in Pahalgam when he was killed. He had got married just a week before the attack.A photo of Vinay's wife Himanshi, sitting near her husband's body following the attack, has been widely shared on social media.His grandfather Hawa Singh Narwal wants ""exemplary punishment"" for the killers.""This terrorism should end. Today, I lost my grandson. Tomorrow, someone else will lose their loved one,"" he said.A witness to the attack's aftermath, Rayees Ahmad Bhat, who used to lead pony treks to the beauty spot where the shootings took place, said his industry was now in ruins.""The attackers may have killed tourists that day, but we - the people of Pahalgam - are dying every day since. They've stained the name of this peaceful town… Pahalgam is terrorised, and its people broken.""The attack was a huge shock for a government which had begun to actively promote tourism in stunningly picturesque Kashmir, famed for its lush valleys, lakes and snow-capped mountains.The source in the Indian administration said this might have lulled Delhi into a false sense of security.""Perhaps we got carried away by the response to tourism in Kashmir. We thought we were over a hump but we were not.""The four-day conflict has once again shown how fragile peace can be between the two nations.Additional reporting by Vikas Pandey in Delhi",Operation Sindoor,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgvr4r5d2qo,BBC,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""framing"", ""reason"": ""The article presents a balanced view of the conflict from both Indian and Pakistani perspectives, but frames India's actions as 'armed response' and 'missile strikes', while Pakistan's actions are described as 'shelling'"", ""confidence"": 0.8}",no,none,"no framing bias, accurate terms used"
108,Is China the winner in the India-Pakistan conflict?,"The four-day conflict between arch-rivals India and Pakistan this month ended with a ceasefire and both claiming victory – but it now appears that China's defence industry might also be an unlikely winner.The latest flare-up began on 7 May when India launched attacks on what it called ""terrorist infrastructure"" inside Pakistan in response to the brutal killing of 26 people, mostly tourists by militants in Pahalgam on 22 April.Many of them were killed in the scenic valley in Indian-administered Kashmir in front of their wives and family members. Delhi accused Islamabad of supporting militant groups involved in the carnage, a charge Pakistan denied.After India's response - which it called Operation Sindoor - to the militant attack, tit-for-tat military manoeuvres from both sides followed, involving drones, missiles and fighter jets.India reportedly used its French and Russian-made jets, while Pakistan deployed its J-10 and J-17 aircraft, which Islamabad co-produces with Beijing. Both sides say their jets did not cross the border and they were firing missiles at each other from a distance.Islamabad claims that its fighter aircraft shot down at least six Indian planes, including the newly-acquired French-made Rafale fighter jets. Delhi hasn't responded to these claims.""Losses are a part of combat,"" Air Marshal AK Bharti of the Indian Air Force (IAF) said last week when a reporter asked him about these claims. Air Marshal Bharti declined to comment on the specific claim of Pakistan downing Indian jets.""We have achieved the objectives that we selected, and all our pilots are back home,"" he added.India said it had killed at least ""100 terrorists"" while targeting the headquarters of the banned Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed militant outfits based in Pakistan.A definitive account of what really happened in the aerial battle is yet to emerge. Some media outlets reported plane crashes in the state of Punjab and Indian-administered Kashmir around the same time but the Indian government has not responded to the reports.A Reuters report quoting American officials said Pakistan possibly had used the Chinese-made J-10 aircraft to launch air-to-air missiles against Indian fighter jets. Pakistan claiming victory after hugely relying on Chinese weapons systems in an active combat situation is being seen by some experts as a boost for Beijing's defence industry but some also disagree with the claim.Some of the experts have called this a ""DeepSeek moment"" for the Chinese weapons industry, referring to January this year when the Chinese AI start-up shook US giants with its cost-effective technology.""The aerial fight was a big advertisement for the Chinese weapons industry. Until now, China had no opportunity to test its platforms in a combat situation,"" Zhou Bo, a retired senior colonel in the Chinese People's Liberation Army, told the BBC.The Beijing-based analyst said the outcome of the air duel showed ""China has some systems that are next to none"". Shares in the Chinese Avic Chengdu Aircraft company, that manufactures fighter jets like the J-10, surged by up to 40% last week after the reported performance of the fighter jet in the India-Pakistan conflict.Other experts, however, feel it's too early to declare the superiority of Chinese weapons systems.Professor Walter Ladwig from the King's College in London said it was yet to be determined whether the Chinese jets had actually outmanoeuvred the Indian Air Force (IAF) planes, particularly the Rafale.""In a standard military doctrine, you would suppress the enemy's air defences and get air superiority before you struck ground targets. Instead, it appears the IAF's mission was clearly not to provoke any Pakistani military retaliation,"" he said.Mr Ladwig thought that the Indian pilots were given instructions to fly despite the fact that the entire Pakistani air defence was on high alert and their jets were already in the sky. The IAF hasn't given details of the mission or about its air operations strategy.Beijing also hasn't made any comment on reports of the J-10 taking down Indian fighter jets, including the Rafale. But unconfirmed reports of the J-10 bringing down a Western weapon system has triggered jubilation and triumphalism on Chinese social media.Carlotta Rinaudo, a China researcher at the International Team for the Study of Security in Verona, said Chinese social media was flooded with nationalistic messages even though it's difficult to reach a conclusion with the available information.""At the moment perception matters way more than reality. If we see it in that way, the main winner is really China,"" she said.For China, Pakistan is a strategic and economic ally. It is investing more than $50bn (£37bn) to build infrastructure in Pakistan as part of its China-Pakistan Economic corridor.So, a weak Pakistan is not in China's interest.China made a critical difference in the latest India-Pakistan conflict, says Imtiaz Gul, a Pakistani security analyst. ""It took the Indian planners by sheer surprise. They didn't probably envision the depth of co-operation in the modern warfare between Pakistan and China,"" he said.Experts say the performance of the Chinese jets in a real combat situation was keenly analysed in Western capitals as this will have cascading impact on global arms trade. The US is the world's largest arms exporter, while China is the fourth.China sells weapons mostly to developing countries like Myanmar and Pakistan. Previously the Chinese weapon systems were criticised for their poor quality and technical problems.Reports said the Burmese military grounded several of its JF-17 fighter jets – jointly manufactured by China and Pakistan in 2022 – due to technical malfunctions.The Nigerian military reported several technical problems with the Chinese made F-7 fighter jets.Another point to be noted is that this was not the first time that India lost an aircraft to Pakistan.In 2019, during a brief air battle between the two sides following similar Indian air strikes on suspected terrorist targets in Pakistan, a Russian-made MiG-21 jet was shot down inside Pakistani territory and the pilot was captured. He was released a few days later.India, however, said that the pilot had ejected after successfully shooting down Pakistani fighter jets, including a US-made F-16. Pakistan has denied the claim.Despite reports of the downing of Indian jets last week, experts like Mr Ladwig argue that India was able to hit an ""impressive breadth of targets"" inside Pakistan early in the morning of 10 May and this fact has gone largely unnoticed by the international media.The Indian military said in a co-ordinated attack, it launched missiles on 11 Pakistani air bases across the country, including the strategic Nur Khan air base outside Rawalpindi, not far from the Pakistani military headquarters. It's a sensitive target that took Islamabad by surprise.One of the furthest targets was in Bholari, 140km (86 miles) from the southern city of Karachi.Mr Ladwig says this time the IAF operated with standard procedures - first attacking Pakistani air defence and radar systems and then focusing on ground targets.The Indian jets used an array of missiles, loitering munitions and drones despite the Pakistanis operating the Chinese-provided HQ 9 air defence system.""It seems the attacks were relatively precise and targeted. The craters were in the middle of runways, exactly the ideal spot. If it were a longer conflict, how long would it take the Pakistani Air Force to get these facilities up and running again, I can't say,"" Mr Ladwig pointed out.Nevertheless, he said, by refusing to get into the details of the mission briefing, India's military ""lost control of the narrative thread"".In response to the Indian strikes, Pakistan said it launched missile and air strikes on several Indian forward air bases, but Delhi said the attacks caused no damage to equipment and personnel.Realising that the situation was getting out of control, the US and its allies intervened and put pressure on both countries to stop the fighting.But for India, experts say, the whole episode is a wake-up call.Beijing may not comment on the details of the recent India-Pakistan conflict, but it's keen to show that its weapon systems are fast catching up with the West.Delhi is aware that the jets China has supplied to Pakistan are some of the earlier models. Beijing has already inducted the more advanced J-20 stealth fighter jets, that can evade radars.India and China have a long-standing border dispute along the Himalayas and fought a brief border war in 1962 that resulted in a defeat for India. A brief border clash took place in Ladakh in June 2020.Experts say India is acutely aware that it needs to accelerate investments in its homegrown defence manufacturing industry and speed up international buying.For now, China's defence industry seems to be enjoying the limelight following the claims of success of one of its aircraft in the India-Pakistan conflict.Follow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook",Operation Sindoor,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1w3dln352vo,BBC,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""framing"", ""reason"": ""The article frames the conflict as a 'win' for China's defence industry, highlighting its success in a real combat situation and implying that it has surpassed Western weapon systems."", ""confidence"": 0.8}",yes,framing,frames the indian govt against China's defence industry gains
109,Indian YouTuber arrested for allegedly 'spying' for Pakistan,"Police in India have arrested a local YouTuber on suspicions of spying for Pakistan.Jyoti Malhotra, a travel influencer from the northern Indian state of Haryana, allegedly travelled to the neighbouring country several times - her last trip was in March 2025.Police in Haryana allege that she was in touch with a Pakistan High Commission official, who was expelled from India earlier this month.The YouTuber's father has denied allegations that she was a spy, saying she went to Pakistan after acquiring necessary permissions.Ms Malhotra describes herself on social media as a ""modern girl with old ideas"", and has 377,000 subscribers on YouTube and 133,000 followers on Instagram.But officers have questioned how she financed her travel around the globe, with her videos documenting visits to places like  Bangladesh, China, Thailand, United Arab Emirates and Indonesia. She has also visited several Indian destinations and religious places. Police say it defies her known source of income.Police claim Ms Malhotra was in touch with ""Pakistani intelligence operatives"" and had continuous contact with a Pakistani citizen.Ms Malhotra is also being investigated for any links with the Pahalgam attack, Shashank Kumar Sawan, the superintendent of police in Haryana's Hisar district, told ANI news agency.They say they have leads on others who may have collaborated with the influencer, who does not have direct access to any military or defence information.""She was in touch with other YouTube influencers... She used to go to Pakistan on sponsored trips,"" Mr Sawan added.Her arrest comes after the Indian government asked Ahsan-ur-Rahim, the Pakistan High Commission official with whom the YouTuber was alleged to have been in contact, to leave the country on 13 May, alleging he had indulged in activities ""not in keeping with his official status in India"".Pakistan also asked an Indian embassy staff member in Islamabad to leave for indulging in activities ""incompatible"" with his privileged status.According to a complaint registered by the police, Ms Malhotra met Ahsan-ur-Rahim for the first time in 2023 when she had visited the Pakistan High Commission in Delhi, seeking a visa to visit the neighbouring country.Her last video on Pakistan was uploaded in March, in which she was seen in the Pakistan High Commission in Delhi attending a Ramadan dinner.In other videos from Pakistan, she is seen visiting Hindu and Sikh temples, famous local markets, and interacting with locals.Arrests in India and Pakistan over allegations of spying are not uncommon.Ms Malhotra's arrest comes following days of military tensions between the neighbours earlier this month.On 7 May, India struck what it calls ""terror infrastructure"" inside Pakistan, days after a deadly militant attack on tourists in Pahalgam, a picturesque valley in Indian-administered Kashmir. Pakistan has denied any involvement in the attacks.After four tense days of deadly clashes between the nuclear-armed neighbours, both countries agreed to a ceasefire on 10 May, announced by US President Donald Trump.Follow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook",Operation Sindoor,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2e7xv8v80o,BBC,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""source"", ""reason"": ""The article relies heavily on Indian police statements and quotes from an Indian superintendent of police, while only mentioning Pakistan's response in a brief statement.

110,How backchannels and US mediators pulled India and Pakistan back from the brink,"In a dramatic turn of events, US President Donald Trump took to social media on Saturday to announce that India and Pakistan - after four tense days of cross-border clashes - had agreed to a ""full and immediate ceasefire"".Behind the scenes, US mediators, alongside diplomatic backchannels and regional players, proved critical in pulling the nuclear-armed rivals back from the brink, experts say.However, hours after a ceasefire deal, India and Pakistan were trading accusations of fresh violations - underscoring its fragility.India accused Pakistan of ""repeated violations"" while Pakistan insisted it remained committed to the ceasefire, with its forces showing ""responsibility and restraint.""Before Trump's ceasefire announcement, India and Pakistan were spiralling towards what many feared could become a full-blown conflict.After a deadly militant attack killed 26 tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir last month, India launched air strikes inside Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir -  triggering days of aerial clashes, artillery duels and, by Saturday morning, accusations from both sides of missile strikes on each other's airbases.The rhetoric escalated sharply, with each country claiming to have inflicted heavy damage while foiling the other's attacks.Tanvi Madan, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington DC, says US   Secretary of State Marco Rubio's call to Pakistani Army Chief Asim Munir on 9 May ""might have been the crucial point"".""There's still much we don't know about the roles of various international actors, but it's clear over the past three days that at least three countries were working to de-escalate - the US, of course, but also the UK and Saudi Arabia,"" she says.Pakistan's Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar told Pakistani media that ""three dozen countries"" were involved in the diplomacy - including Turkey, Saudi Arabia and the US.""One question is whether, if this call had come earlier - right after the initial Indian strikes, when Pakistan was already claiming some Indian losses and an off-ramp was available - it might have prevented further escalation,"" Ms Madan says.This isn't the first time US mediation has helped defuse an India–Pakistan crisis.In his memoir, former US secretary of state Mike Pompeo claimed he was woken up to speak with an unnamed ""Indian counterpart"", who feared Pakistan was preparing nuclear weapons during the 2019 standoff.Former Indian High Commissioner to Pakistan Ajay Bisaria later wrote that Pompeo overstated both the risk of nuclear escalation and the US role in calming the conflict.But diplomats say there is little doubt the US played an important role in defusing the crisis this time.""The US was the most prominent external player. Last time, Pompeo claimed they averted nuclear war. While they'll likely exaggerate, they may have played the primary diplomatic role, perhaps amplifying Delhi's positions in Islamabad,"" Mr Bisaria told the BBC on Saturday.Yet at the outset, the US appeared strikingly standoffish.As tensions flared, US Vice President JD Vance said on Thursday that the US was not going to get involved in a war that's ""fundamentally none of our business"".""We can't control these countries though. Fundamentally, India has its gripes with Pakistan... America can't tell the Indians to lay down their arms. We can't tell the Pakistanis to lay down their arms. And so we're going to continue to pursue this thing through diplomatic channels, "" he said in a television interview.Meanwhile, President Trump said earlier this week: ""I know both [leaders of India and Pakistan] very well, and I want to see them work it out... I want to see them stop, and hopefully they can stop now"".Ejaz Haider, a Lahore-based defence analyst, told the BBC this appeared to be the only difference from previous occasions.""The American role was a continuation of past patterns, but with one key difference - this time, they initially stayed hands-off, watching the crisis unfold instead of jumping in right away. Only when they saw how it was playing out did they step in to manage it,"" Mr Haider told the BBC.Experts in Pakistan say as the escalation cycle deepened, Pakistan sent ""dual signals"", retaliating militarily while announcing a National Command Authority (NCA) meeting - a clear reminder of the nuclear overhang.The NCA controls and takes operational decisions regarding Pakistan's nuclear weapons.This was around the time US Secretary of State Marco Rubio stepped in.""The US was indispensable. This outcome would not have occurred without Secretary Rubio's efforts,"" Ashley J Tellis, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, told the BBC.What also helped was Washington's deepening ties with Delhi.Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's personal rapport with Trump, plus the US's broader strategic and economic stakes, gave the US administration diplomatic leverage to push both nuclear-armed rivals towards de-escalation.Indian diplomats see three key peace tracks that happened this time, much like after Pulwama–Balakot in 2019:Despite shifting global priorities and a hands-off posture at first, the US ultimately stepped in as the indispensable mediator between South Asia's nuclear rivals.Whether overstated by its own officials or underacknowledged by Delhi and Islamabad, experts believe the US's role as crisis manager remains as vital - and as complicated - as ever.Doubts do, however, linger over the ceasefire's durability after Saturday's events, with some Indian media reporting it was essentially brokered by senior military officials of the two countries - not the US.""This ceasefire is bound to be a fragile one. It came about very quickly, amid sky-high tensions. India appears to have interpreted it differently than did the US and Pakistan,"" Michael Kugelman, a foreign policy analyst, told the BBC.""Also, since it was put together so hastily, the accord may lack the proper guarantees and assurances one would need at such a tense moment.""",Operation Sindoor,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyn617xv4no,BBC,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""tonality"", ""reason"": ""The article's tone is generally neutral and informative, but it occasionally uses phrases that imply a positive view of US mediation, such as 'US mediators... proved critical in pulling the nuclear-armed rivals back from"", ""confidence"": 0.7}",yes,tonality," occasionally uses phrases that imply a positive view of US mediation, such as 'US mediators... proved critical in pulling the nuclear-armed rivals back "
111,India-Pakistan ceasefire appears to hold after accusations of violations,"A ceasefire between India and Pakistan appears to have held overnight into Sunday, after the two nations accused each other of ""violations"" just hours after a deal was reached.Days of cross-border military strikes had preceded the US-brokered deal, marking the worst military confrontation between the two rivals in decades.US President Donald Trump praised India and Pakistan's leaders for agreeing the ceasefire in fresh comments on Sunday morning, saying millions of people could have died without it.This comes after explosions were heard in Indian-administered Kashmir hours after the deal was announced, with both sides accusing each other of violations.The use of drones, missiles and artillery started when India struck targets in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, in response to a deadly militant attack in Pahalgam last month. Pakistan denies any involvement.US President Donald Trump announced the ""full and immediate"" ceasefire on his Truth Social Platform on Saturday. He said it had been brokered by the US.Pakistan's foreign minister later confirmed the agreement had been reached by the two countries, adding that ""three dozen countries"" were involved in the diplomacy.But hours after the announcement, residents - and BBC reporters - in the main Indian-administered Kashmiri cities of Srinagar and Jammu reported hearing explosions and seeing flashes in the sky.Indian Foreign Secretary Misri accused Pakistan of ""repeated violations"" of the deal, and said his country's armed forces would give ""an appropriate response"".Meanwhile, a spokesman for Pakistan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Pakistan remained committed to implementing the deal, ""notwithstanding the violations being committed by India in some areas"", and said troops on the ground should ""exercise restraint"".Kashmir is claimed in full by both India and Pakistan, but administered only in part by each since they were partitioned following independence from the UK in 1947.It has been a flashpoint between the two nuclear-armed nations and they have fought two wars over it.Confirming the ceasefire, India's external affairs minister S Jaishankar said the two nations had ""worked out an understanding on stoppage of firing and military action"".""India has consistently maintained a firm and uncompromising stance against terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. It will continue to do so,"" he added.Later, in an address to the nation, Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said the ceasefire had been reached ""for the benefit of everybody"".US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said following the announcement that India and Pakistan had agreed to start talks on a broad set of issues at a neutral site.He said he and US Vice-President JD Vance had spent 48 hours with senior Indian and Pakistani officials, including their respective Prime Ministers Narendra Modi and Shehbaz Sharif.In a further Truth Social post on Sunday, Trump repeated praise for India and Pakistan's leaders for understanding it was ""time to stop the current aggression"".""I am proud that the USA was able to help you arrive at this historic and heroic decision,"" he added.UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said he welcomed ""all efforts to de-escalate the conflict"".UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said the UK has been ""engaged"" in talks for ""some days"", with Foreign Secretary David Lammy speaking to both sides.""I'm pleased to see today that there's a ceasefire,"" Sir Keir said. ""The task now is to make sure that that is enduring and is lasting.""The recent fighting came after two weeks of tension following the killing of 26 tourists in the resort town of Pahalgam.Survivors of the 22 April attack in Indian-administered Kashmir, which killed 25 Indians and one Nepali national, said the militants had singled out Hindu men.The Indian defence ministry said its strikes this week were part of a ""commitment"" to hold ""accountable"" those responsible for the attack. Pakistan described them as ""unprovoked"".Pakistan said Indian air strikes and cross-border fire since Wednesday had killed 36 people in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, while India's army reported at least 21 civilians deaths from Pakistani shelling.Fighting intensified overnight on Friday, with both countries accusing each other of targeting airbases and other military sites.",Operation Sindoor,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg9d913v20o,BBC,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""source"", ""reason"": ""The article relies heavily on statements from US President Donald Trump, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, while only briefly mentioning Pakistani officials' responses.

112,How can India and Pakistan find a way to de-escalate?,"As the continuing India-Pakistan crisis takes a dangerous turn, nations around the world are urging calm.The initial thinking was that after India launched air strikes, and with Pakistan claiming to have shot down several Indian jets - a claim Delhi has not confirmed - both sides could claim ""victory"" and de-escalate.But there's a danger that any protracted tit-for-tat attacks could lead them to a far more damaging prospect.During past conflicts, such as in 2019 and 2016, it was the United States and a few other global powers that put pressure on Delhi and Islamabad to bring the situation under control and de-escalate.Now passions are running high and the nationalist rhetoric has reached a crescendo on both sides. The neighbours are closer to war than in recent decades.“The World community is keeping quiet; that’s dangerous,” Ayesha Siddiqa, a Pakistani academic who is a senior fellow at King’s College London.“Though the flare up has been happening for decades, this is the first time the two countries find themselves in a conflict without anyone monitoring them or forcefully telling them to stop,” she said.Unless Washington gets more involved, Islamabad and Delhi may continue with their accusations and counter-accusations.Although US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has been telling the senior leaders of India and Pakistan to de-escalate, the message from other American leaders is different.US Vice-President JD Vance has said that a potential war between India and Pakistan would be ""none of our business"" during an interview with Fox News.""We want this thing to de-escalate as quickly as possible. We can't control these countries, though,"" Vance said.Vance was on a visit to India when the militant attack in Indian-administered Kashmir, which killed 26 civilians, took place.US President Donald Trump had earlier called rising tension between India and Pakistan a ""shame"".During previous India-Pakistan skirmishes, for example in 2019, tension was defused quickly after India carried out what it called “surgical strikes” on what it called terrorist camps inside Pakistan.One Indian military jet was shot down in the aftermath of the crisis and the pilot was captured by Pakistan. He was released two days later after reported intervention from Washington and other world powers.But the intensity of the current conflict is different and passions are running high on both sides.While the Trump administration’s priorities are more about tariffs, China and Ukraine-Russia, it may require a concerted attempt by the international community to lower tension between the two nuclear-armed rivals.The other world power which has a stake in South Asia is China. Beijing has close economic and military ties with Islamabad. It has invested more than $50bn (£37.5bn) in Pakistan as parts of its China-Pakistan Economic Corridor to boost trade.China also has unresolved border issues with India and the two countries recently had a border clash in the Himalayan region 2020. Despite the tension, China is the second largest trading partner of India.""If the US is uninterested [in resolving India-Pakistan tension] then other permanent members of the UN Security Council – P5 - should get involved. It is their responsibility as well,"" Shen Dingli, a Shanghai-based international affairs expert tells the BBC.As India accuses Pakistan of supporting the Kashmiri separatist rebels, who carried out the deadly attack on tourists last month, the Chinese academic says ""the P-5 members can launch a credible investigation into the incident"", to address India's concerns.Gulf states like Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, which have close ties to both the countries, could step up their mediation efforts.Saudi Arabian Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Adel Al-Jubeir arrived in Delhi on 7 May in what was seen as a surprise visit amid the backdrop of a spike in tensions between India and Pakistan.“A good meeting with Adel Al-Jubeir,"" Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar said, adding that his counterpart “shared India’s perspective on firmly countering terrorism”.The Saudi minister arrived in Islamabad on Friday for talks with Pakistan's leaders.There are an estimated 2.6 million Pakistanis living and working in the Gulf Kingdom. Riyadh has considerable influence in Pakistan.Saudi Arabia has loaned billions of dollars to Pakistan to bail out the country during economic crises over the years.One way out of the current crisis could be a situation where both sides can claim victory to satisfy their audience.Delhi says the missile strikes on suspected militant hideouts inside Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir were part of a commitment to hold “accountable” those responsible for the last month’s attack in Pahalgam.“India has already said it has achieved its objectives. Now, the ball is in Pakistan’s court. If they wish to retaliate then that would elicit a strong response from India,” retired Indian Lt Gen D S Hooda said.For Pakistan, especially for its powerful military, it would want to show its people that it can stand up against India and teach it a lesson once again by downing five of the Indian air force jets during a dog fight.India has not acknowledged the loss of any of its fighter jets in the current skirmish.But according to Pakistani academic Siddiqa, how the current crisis ends depends on what India’s stated objectives are.“India’s goal posts keep changing day by day – from punishing Pakistan to attaining something more,” she said.",Operation Sindoor,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyzg8ygeezo,BBC,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""framing"", ""reason"": ""The article frames the India-Pakistan crisis as a situation where both sides can claim 'victory' to satisfy their audience, implying that the conflict is driven by domestic politics rather than a genuine security concern"", ""confidence"": 0.8}",yes,framing," frames the India-Pakistan crisis as a situation where both sides can claim 'victory' to satisfy their audience, implying that the conflict is driven by domestic politics rather than a genuine security concern"
113,Kashmir: Why India and Pakistan fight over it,"Nuclear-armed neighbours India and Pakistan have fought two wars and a limited conflict over Kashmir.But why do they dispute the territory - and how did it start?Kashmir is an ethnically diverse Himalayan region famed for the beauty of its lakes, meadows and snow-capped mountains.Even before India and Pakistan won their independence from Britain in August 1947, the area was hotly contested.Under the partition plan provided by the Indian Independence Act, Muslim-majority Kashmir was free to accede to either India or Pakistan.The maharaja (local ruler), Hari Singh, initially wanted Kashmir to become independent - but in October 1947 chose to join India, in return for its help against an invasion of tribesmen from Pakistan.A war erupted and India asked the United Nations to intervene. The UN recommended holding a plebiscite to settle the question of whether the state would join India or Pakistan. However, the two countries could not agree to a deal to demilitarise the region before the referendum could be held.In July 1949, India and Pakistan signed an agreement to establish a ceasefire line as recommended by the UN and the region became divided.A second war followed in 1965. Then in 1999, India fought a brief but bitter conflict with Pakistani-backed forces.By that time, India and Pakistan were declared nuclear powers. Today, Delhi and Islamabad both claim Kashmir in full, but control only parts of it.Within Indian-administered Kashmir, opinions about the territory's rightful allegiance are diverse and strongly held. Many do not want it to be governed by India, or prefer a return to the semi-autonomous status that they had until 2019. Some also want outright independence.Religion is also an important factor: Indian-administered Kashmir is more than 60% Muslim, making it the only part of India where Muslims are in the majority.An armed revolt has been waged against Indian rule in the region since 1989, claiming tens of thousands of lives.India accuses Pakistan of backing militants in Kashmir - a charge its neighbour denies.In 2019, Indian-administered Kashmir was stripped of its semi-autonomous status by the government in Delhi amid a huge security crackdown.For several years after the revocation of the region's special status, militancy waned and tourist visits soared.In 2016, after 19 Indian soldiers were killed in Uri, India launched ""surgical strikes"" across the Line of Control - the de facto border between India and Pakistan - targeting alleged militant bases.In 2019, the Pulwama bombing, which left more than 40 Indian paramilitary personnel dead, prompted Indian airstrikes deep into Balakot - the first such action inside Pakistan since 1971 - sparking retaliatory raids and an aerial dogfight.Tensions rose again in April 2025 after years of relative calm when militants killed 26 people in an attack on tourists near the resort town of Pahalgam in Indian-administered Kashmir. It was the deadliest attack on civilians in two decades.India responded two weeks later with missile strikes on targets in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, once again raising fears of further escalation and calls for restraint.Kashmir remains one of the most militarised zones in the world.India and Pakistan did agree a ceasefire in 2003.In 2014, India's current Prime Minister Narendra Modi came to power promising a tough line on Pakistan, but also showed interest in holding peace talks.Nawaz Sharif, then prime minister of Pakistan, attended Modi's swearing-in ceremony in Delhi.But a year later, India blamed Pakistan-based groups for an attack on its airbase in Pathankot in the northern state of Punjab. Modi also cancelled a scheduled visit to the Pakistani capital, Islamabad, for a regional summit in 2017.Since then, there hasn't been any progress in talks between the neighbours.",Operation Sindoor,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c30q09638n8o,BBC,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""omission"", ""reason"": ""The article does not mention Operation Sindoor, which is the event context provided.

114,The first drone war opens a new chapter in India-Pakistan conflict,"The world's first drone war between nuclear-armed neighbours has erupted in South Asia.On Thursday, India accused Pakistan of launching waves of drones and missiles at three military bases in Indian territory and Indian-administered Kashmir - an allegation Islamabad swiftly denied.Pakistan claimed it had shot down 25 Indian drones in recent hours. Delhi remained publicly silent. Experts say the tit-for-tat attacks mark a dangerous new phase in the decades-old rivalry, as both sides exchange not just artillery but unmanned weapons across a volatile border.As Washington and other global powers urge restraint, the region is teetering on the edge of escalation, with drones -  silent, remote and deniable - opening a new chapter in the India-Pakistan conflict.""The Indo-Pak conflict is moving into a new drone era - one where 'invisible eyes' and unmanned precision may determine escalation or restraint. Thus, in South Asia's contested skies, the side that masters drone warfare won't just see the battlefield - they'll shape it,"" Jahara Matisek, a professor at the US Naval War College, told the BBC.Since Wednesday morning, Pakistan says Indian air strikes and cross-border fire have killed 36 people and injured 57 more in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir. On the other side, India's army reports at least 16 civilians dead from Pakistani shelling. India insists its missile barrage was retaliation for a deadly militant attack on Indian tourists in Pahalgam last month - an attack Islamabad denies any role in.Pakistan's military announced on Thursday that it had shot down 25 Indian drones across various cities, including Karachi, Lahore and Rawalpindi. The drones - reportedly Israeli-made Harop drones - were reportedly intercepted using both technical and weapon-based countermeasures. India claimed to have neutralised several Pakistani air defence radars and systems, including one in Lahore, which Islamabad denied.Laser-guided missiles and bombs, drones and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have become pivotal in modern warfare, significantly enhancing the precision and efficiency of military operations. These can relay co-ordinates for airstrikes or, if equipped, directly laser-designate targets, and help immediate engagement.Drones can be used as decoys or suppression of enemy air defences, flying into contested airspace to trigger enemy radar emissions, which can then be targeted by other munitions like loitering drones or anti-radiation missiles. ""This is how Ukraine and Russia both do it in their war. This dual role - targeting and triggering - makes drones a force multiplier in degrading enemy air defences without risking manned aircraft,"" says Prof Matisek.Experts say India's drone fleet is largely built around Israeli-made reconnaissance UAVs like the IAI Searcher and Heron, along with Harpy and Harop loitering munitions - drones that double as missiles, capable of autonomous reconnaissance and precision strikes. The Harop, in particular, signals a shift toward high-value, precision-targeted warfare, reflecting the growing importance of loitering munitions in modern conflict, experts say.The Heron, say experts, is India's ""high-altitude eyes in the sky"" for both peacetime monitoring and combat operations. The IAI Searcher Mk II is designed for frontline operations, offering up to 18 hours of endurance, a range of 300km (186 miles), and a service ceiling of 7,000m (23,000ft).While many believe India's combat drone numbers remain ""modest"", a recent $4bn deal to acquire 31 MQ-9B Predator drones - which can can fly for 40 hours and up to an altitude of 40,000ft - from the US marks a major leap in its strike capabilities.India is also developing swarm drone tactics - deploying large numbers of smaller UAVs to overwhelm and saturate air defences, allowing higher-value assets to penetrate, say experts.Pakistan's drone fleet is ""extensive and diverse"", comprising both indigenous and imported systems, Ejaz Haider, a Lahore-based defence analyst told the BBC.He said the inventory includes ""over a thousand drones"", featuring models from China, Turkey and domestic manufacturers. Notable platforms include the Chinese CH-4, the Turkish Bayraktar Akinci, and Pakistan's own Burraq and Shahpar drones. Additionally, Pakistan has developed loitering munitions, enhancing its strike capabilities.Mr Haider said the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) has been actively integrating unmanned systems into its operations for nearly a decade. A key focus is the development of ""loyal wingman"" drones - unmanned aerial vehicles designed to operate in co-ordination with manned aircraft, he added.Prof Matisek believes ""Israel's technical assistance, supplying Harop and Heron drones, has been pivotal for India, while Pakistan's reliance on Turkish and Chinese platforms highlights an ongoing arms race"".While the recent drone exchanges between India and Pakistan mark a significant escalation in their rivalry, they differ markedly from the drone-centric warfare observed in the Russia-Ukraine conflict, experts say. There, drones become central to military operations, with both sides deploying thousands of UAVs for surveillance, targeting and direct attacks.""Deploying drones [in the ongoing conflict] instead of fighter jets or heavy missiles represents a lower-level military option. Drones are less heavily armed than manned aircraft, so in one sense, this is a restrained move. However, if this is merely a prelude to a broader aerial campaign, the calculus changes entirely,"" Manoj Joshi, an Indian defence analyst, told the BBC.Ejaz Haider believes the recent drone activity in Jammu ""appears to be a tactical response to immediate provocations, not a full-scale retaliation [by Pakistan]"".""A true retaliatory strike against India would involve shock and awe. It would likely be more comprehensive, involving multiple platforms - both manned and unmanned - and targeting a broader range of objectives. Such an operation would aim to deliver a decisive impact, signalling a significant escalation beyond the current tit-for-tat exchanges,"" Mr Haider says.While drones have fundamentally reshaped the battlefield in Ukraine, their role in the India-Pakistan conflict remains more limited and symbolic, say experts. Both countries are using their manned air forces to fire missiles at one another as well.""The drone warfare we're witnessing may not last long; it could be just the beginning of a larger conflict,"" says Mr Joshi.""This could either signal a de-escalation or an escalation - both possibilities are on the table. We're at an inflection point; the direction we take from here is uncertain.""Clearly India is integrating drones into its precision-strike doctrine, enabling stand-off targeting without crossing borders with manned aircraft. However, this evolution also raises critical questions.""Drones lower the political and operational threshold for action, providing options to surveil and strike while trying to reduce escalation risks,"" says Prof Matisek.""But they also create new escalation dynamics: every drone shot down, every radar blinded, becomes a potential flashpoint in this tense environment between two nuclear powers.""",Operation Sindoor,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy6w6507wqo,BBC,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""framing"", ""reason"": ""The article frames the drone war as a 'new chapter' in the India-Pakistan conflict, emphasizing its potential for escalation and the dangers of 'invisible eyes' and unmanned precision."", ""confidence"": 0.8}",yes,framing,"frames the drone war as a 'new chapter' in the India-Pakistan conflict, emphasizing its potential for escalation and the dangers of 'invisible eyes' and unmanned precisio"
115,How Kashmir attack victim's widow went from symbol of tragedy to trolling target,"Two weeks ago, the photograph of a woman sitting motionless beside her husband's body went viral across Indian social media.It captured a moment of unspeakable grief - one that came to symbolise the 22 April militant attack in Indian-administered Kashmir in which 26 civilians were killed.The woman in the photo was Himanshi Narwal, whose husband, a 26-year-old naval officer, was among the victims. The couple, who had been married for less than a week, were on their honeymoon when Vinay Narwal was shot dead.But within days, Ms Narwal, who had been portrayed as the face of the tragedy, found herself at the centre of a hate campaign.It started last week when she urged people not to target Muslims or Kashmiris as emotions ran high across the country.Survivors of the attack have said that Hindu men were targeted, and that the victims were shot after the militants checked their religion. Indian security forces are still searching for the attackers.Since the attack, there have been reports of Kashmiri vendors and students in other Indian cities facing harassment and threats, mainly from members of Hindu right-wing groups.""People going against Muslims or Kashmiris - we don't want this. We want peace and only peace,"" Ms Narwal told reporters at a blood donation camp held by the family on what would have been her husband's 27th birthday. ""Of course, we want justice. The people who have wronged him should be punished,"" she added.It was her first public statement since a video of her bidding an emotional farewell over her husband's coffin went viral. In it, the grief-stricken widow says with tears: ""It is because of him that the world is still surviving. And we should all be proud of him in every way.""Her appeal for peace sparked a swift backlash. Within hours, many of the internet users who had earlier mourned her loss were posting abusive comments.Some accused her of dishonouring her husband's memory as she refused to blame ordinary Kashmiris for the attack. Others made and shared unfounded claims about her friendships and relationships with Kashmiri men while studying at a university in Delhi. Yet more claimed that she had no right to speak about her husband's death as they were only married for a few days.As the online abuse continued, India's National Commission for Women (NCW) wrote on X that the trolling was ""extremely reprehensible and unfortunate"".""Perhaps her reaction may not have gone down well with angry people. But any kind of agreement or disagreement should always be expressed with decency and within constitutional limits,"" NCW Chairperson Vijaya Rahatkar wrote on X.Journalist Namita Bhandare, who covers gender issues, told the BBC that it was ""shocking"" how much hatred Ms Narwal received for simply appealing for peace and calm.She was viciously trolled because she ""appealed for peace rather than succumbing to the narrative of revenge"", Ms Bhandare added.Ms Narwal was not the only survivor of the attack to face online abuse.Arathi R Menon, the daughter of a man from Kerala state who was killed in the shootings, was also trolled after she recounted her ordeal in front of the media.Some people said that she spoke too calmly and didn't display much emotion as she recounted her father's death. Others found fault with her praising two Kashmiri men who she said helped her and took care of her ""like a sister"".""It is the same old story - women are always the easy targets,"" says Ms Bhandare, adding that female victims of online abuse are also likely to be sexualised and threatened with violence.""Being faceless online gives people the courage to say whatever they want,"" she says. ""And of course, there's patriarchy at play, women are singled out, no matter who they are.""Amid the abuse, Ms Narwal received support online as well.""Your [Ms Narwal's] statement in the face of that loss was an act of grace and unimaginable strength,"" writer and activist Gurmehar Kaur wrote on X.""My mother was your age when she lost my father in the [Kashmir] valley. I know this kind of loss.""In 2017, Kaur, then a graduate student, became the target of a vicious social media campaign after she spoke against a Hindu right-wing student group after a clash at a college in Delhi. Many of the people who trolled her took issue with an earlier campaign by her where she said her father, a soldier who died in 1999, was killed by war, not Pakistan.Journalist Rohini Singh welcomed the NCW's statement supporting Ms Narwal, but asked why no action had been taken against the social media accounts ""blatantly abusing and slandering her"".Members of India's opposition parties have also urged the government to act.Priyanka Chaturvedi, an MP from the Shiv Sena (UBT) party, tagged federal Information and Broadcasting Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw in a post, asking him to ""stand with the widow of an Indian officer"" and take action against the trolling.No Indian minister has commented on the trolling campaign yet, and no police complaint has been lodged.Meanwhile, Ms Bhandare says that, like many online hate campaigns, this too may follow a familiar pattern: ""It will run its course and then the people will move on to their next target.""Follow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook",Operation Sindoor,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr5dgvmn6y5o,BBC,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""tonality"", ""reason"": ""Loaded language used to describe online abuse as 'vicious', 'shocking', and 'reprehensible' with a clear tone of disapproval towards the perpetrators."", ""confidence"": 0.8}",no,none,correct words are used against the  perpetrators
116,"India reports strikes on military bases, Pakistan denies any role","India has accused Pakistan of attacking three of its military bases with drones and missiles, a claim which has been denied by Islamabad.The Indian Army said it had foiled Pakistan's attempts to attack its bases in Jammu and Udhampur, in Indian-administered Kashmir, and Pathankot, in India's Punjab state.Blasts were reported on Thursday evening in Jammu city in Indian-administered Kashmir as the region went into a blackout.Pakistan's defence minister told the BBC they were not behind the attack.""We deny it, we have not mounted anything so far,"" Khawaja Asif told the BBC, adding: ""We will not strike and then deny"".Earlier on Thursday, India said it had struck Pakistan's air defences and ""neutralised"" Islamabad's attempts to hit military targets in India on Wednesday night.Pakistan called that action another ""act of aggression"", following Indian missile strikes on Wednesday on targets in Pakistan and Pakistani-administered Kashmir.India's strikes on Wednesday sparked a chorus of calls for de-escalation from the international community with the UN and world leaders calling for calm.The attacks and incidents of shelling along the border have fanned fears of wider conflict erupting between the nuclear-armed states.It is being viewed as the worst confrontation between the two countries in more than two decades.India said it hit nine ""terrorist infrastructure"" sites on Wednesday in retaliation for  a militant attack on tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir last month.Pakistan has strongly denied Indian claims that it backed the militants who killed 26 civilians in the mountainous town of Pahalgam.It was the bloodiest attack on civilians in the region for years, sending tensions soaring. Most of the victims were Indian tourists.Indian-administered Kashmir has seen a decades-long insurgency against Indian rule which has claimed thousands of lives.Kashmir has been a flashpoint between the countries since they became independent after British India was partitioned in 1947. Both claim Kashmir and have fought two wars over it.There were calls for restraint from around the world after India launched ""Operation Sindoor"" early on Wednesday.But on Thursday both sides accused each other of further military action.Pakistan's military spokesman said drones sent by India had been engaged in multiple locations.""Last night, India showed another act of aggression by sending drones to multiple locations,"" Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry said. ""These locations are Lahore, Gujranwala, Chakwal, Rawalpindi, Attock, Bahawalpur, Miano, Chor and near Karachi.""He said one civilian had been killed in Sindh province and four troops injured in Lahore.The US consulate in Lahore told its staff to shelter in the building.India said its latest action had been taken in response to Pakistan's attempts to ""engage a number of military targets in northern and western India"" overnight.""It has been reliably learnt that an Air Defence system at Lahore has been neutralised,"" a Defence Ministry statement said. Pakistan denied the claim.There was no independent confirmation of the two countries' versions of events.Later in the day India's foreign secretary Vikram Misri told a news conference in Delhi: ""Our intention has not been to escalate matters, we are only responding to the original escalation.""Meanwhile, casualty numbers continue to rise. Pakistan says 31 people have been killed and 57 injured by Indian air strikes in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, and firing along the Line of Control, since Wednesday morning.India's army said the number of people killed by Pakistani firing in the disputed Kashmir region had risen to 16, including three women and five children.India initially did not name any group it believed was behind the attack in Pahalgam but on 7 May it accused the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba militant group of carrying it out.Indian police have alleged that two of the attackers were Pakistani nationals, a claim denied by Islamabad. It says it has nothing to do with the 22 April attacks.In a late-night address on Wednesday, Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif vowed to avenge those killed in India's strikes.He repeated Pakistan's claim that it had shot down five Indian fighter jets, saying that was a ""crushing response"".

117,'We need to stand united' amid India-Pakistan conflict,"Community leaders have called for people to stand united as tensions escalate between India and Pakistan following reported military strikes between the two countries.On Wednesday, Indian forces launched ""Operation Sindoor"" targeting sites in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, in retaliation for a deadly militant attack in Indian-administered Kashmir that killed at least 26 people on 22 April.Pakistan denies involvement, but Indian authorities allege attackers included Pakistani nationals.In the west of England, the impact of the conflict is reverberating on families who are fielding anxious WhatsApp calls. Local leaders are also stepping forward to offer guidance and solidarity.There is growing concern, not only for relatives overseas, but also over the risk of tensions disrupting the unity between communities in the region.Bristol Green Party councillor Abdul Malik, who recently returned from his ancestral village in Azad Jammu and Kashmir, said the escalation tension has ""caused a lot of grief"".After Wednesday's strikes in Pakistan, a gathering was held at Easton's Jamia Mosque.""It's so important to give a sense of security to the elders who've lived most of their lives in the UK but still feel so connected to what happens abroad,"" said Mr Malik.""This isn't a war about religion. This is a political war about borders. We must not bring hatred to our streets and our homes.""Bristol has a wonderful Indian and Pakistani community. We've sat together. We've listened. This is the time to stand united - and that's what we intend to do.""""Trying to avoid any conflicts is my main concern,"" said Pankaj Pandya, one of the trustees of the Hindu Temple in Bristol.""Hopefully it doesn't escalate, and it doesn't become tit-for-tat leading to an outright war between two nuclear nations.""Being an Indian myself, it's a concern for not only what is happening between India and Pakistan, but just generally the issues of war throughout the world at the moment.""Local leaders in the west of England are also are urging communities not to spread misinformation online.""There's a lot of fake information and false news being spread around which doesn't help the situation,"" said Atiff Ghafar, vice chair of the Swindon Pakistan Association.""So, we have been telling and encouraging our communities not to share unverified news reports.""Pakistan says 36 people have been killed by Indian air strikes and firing.

118,What we know about India's air strikes,"Two weeks after a deadly militant attack on tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir, India has launched a series of strikes on sites in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir.The Indian defence ministry said the strikes - named ""Operation Sindoor"" - were part of a ""commitment"" to hold ""accountable"" those responsible for the 22 April attack in Pahalgam, Indian-administered Kashmir, which left 25 Indians and one Nepali national dead.But Pakistan, which has denied any involvement in that attack, described the strikes as ""unprovoked"", with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif saying the ""heinous act of aggression will not go unpunished"".Sharif on Wednesday said the Pahalgam attack ""wasn't related"" to Pakistan, and that his country was ""accused for the wrong"" reasons.Pakistan's military said at least 31 people were killed and 57 injured in the strikes on Tuesday night. India's army said at least 15 civilians were killed and 43 injured by Pakistani shelling on its side of the de facto border.Pakistan's military says it shot down five Indian aircraft and a drone. India has yet to respond to these claims.Late on Wednesday, Sharif said the air force made its defence - which was a ""reply from our side to them"".Delhi said in the early hours of Wednesday morning that nine different locations had been targeted in both Pakistan-administered Kashmir and Pakistan.It said these sites were ""terrorist infrastructure"" - places where attacks were ""planned and directed"".It emphasised that it had not hit any Pakistani military facilities, saying its ""actions have been focused, measured and non-escalatory in nature"".In the initial aftermath of the attacks, Pakistan said three different areas were hit: Muzaffarabad and Kotli in Pakistan-administered Kashmir, and Bahawalpur in the Pakistani province of Punjab. Pakistan's military spokesperson, Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif, later said six locations had been hit.Pakistan's Defence Minister Khawaja Asif told GeoTV in the early hours of Wednesday that the strikes hit civilian areas, adding that India's claim of ""targeting terrorist camps"" was false.The strikes come after weeks of rising tension between the nuclear-armed neighbours over the shootings in the picturesque resort town of Pahalgam.The 22 April attack by a group of militants saw 26 people killed, with survivors saying the militants were singling out Hindu men.It was the worst attack on civilians in the region in two decades, and the first major attack on civilians since India revoked Article 370, which gave Kashmir semi-autonomous status, in 2019.Following the decision, the region saw protests but also witnessed militancy wane and a huge increase in the number of tourists.The killings have sparked widespread anger in India, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi saying the country would hunt the suspects ""till the ends of the Earth"" and that those who planned and carried it out ""will be punished beyond their imagination"".However, India initially did not name any group it believed was behind the attack in Pahalgam.But Indian police alleged that two of the attackers were Pakistani nationals, with Delhi accusing Pakistan of supporting militants - a charge Islamabad denies. It says it has nothing to do with the 22 April attacks.On 7 May, Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri said Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba militant group carried out the attack.In the two weeks since, both sides had taken tit-for-tat measures against each other - including expelling diplomats, suspending visas and closing border crossings.But many expected it would escalate to some sort of cross-border strike - as seen after the Pulwama attacks which left 40 Indian paramilitary personnel dead in 2019.Kashmir is claimed in full by India and Pakistan, but administered only in part by each since they were partitioned following independence from Britain in 1947.The countries have fought two wars over it.But more recently, it has been attacks by militants which have brought the two countries to the brink. Indian-administered Kashmir has seen an armed insurgency against Indian rule since 1989, with militants targeting security forces and civilians alike.In 2016, after 19 Indian soldiers were killed in Uri, India launched ""surgical strikes"" across the Line of Control – the de facto border between India and Pakistan - targeting militant bases.In 2019, the Pulwama bombing, which left 40 Indian paramilitary personnel dead, prompted airstrikes deep into Balakot - the first such action inside Pakistan since 1971 - sparking retaliatory raids and an aerial dogfight.Neither spiralled, but the wider world remains alert to the danger of what could happen if it did. Attempts have been made by various nations and diplomats around the world to prevent this.UN Secretary-General António Guterres quickly called for ""maximum restraint"" - a sentiment echoed by the European Union and numerous countries, including Bangladesh.British Prime Minister Keir Starmer urged ""dialogue"" and ""de-escalation"".US President Donald Trump - who was one of the first to respond - told reporters at the White House that he hoped the fighting ""ends very quickly"".

A search for screengrabs from the video on Google found the footage actually showed Israeli strikes on the Gaza Strip on 13 October 2023.While much of the debunked footage has purported to show the immediate aftermath of the Indian strikes, some clips analysed by BBC Verify appeared to be trying to portray the Pakistani response as being more severe than it actually was.One video, which has racked up almost 600,000 views on X, claimed to show that the ""Pakistan army blew up the Indian Brigade headquarters"". The clip, which shows blasts in the darkness, is actually from an unrelated video circulating on YouTube as early as last month.Elsewhere, one set of photos purported to show an operation carried out by the Pakistan Air Force targeting ""Indian forward air-bases in the early hours of 6 May 2025"". The images - which appeared to be captured by a drone - were actually screengrabs taken from the video game Battlefield 3.The Pakistani military says it destroyed five jets on Wednesday morning local time. That announcement has led to some users sharing unrelated clips which they claimed showed the wreckage of Indian fighter jets. Some of these videos have obtained millions of views.But two widely shared images actually showed previous Indian air force jet crashes - one from an incident in Rajasthan in 2024 and another in the Punjab state in 2021. Both crashes were widely reported.Prof Indrajit Roy of York University said that the images ""are being generated with a view to get support for the military in Pakistan"". One clip circulated by the Pakistani military itself was later withdrawn by news agencies after it turned out to be from an unrelated event.""We have jingoists on both sides of the border, and they have a huge platform on Twitter (X). You can see how fake news, as well as some real news, gets amplified, distorted and presented in ways designed to generate hostility, animosity and hatred for the other side.""The conflict in Kashmir has long attracted a high degree of misinformation online. In the aftermath of the deadly militant attack on Indian tourists in Pahalgam last month, AI images circulated - with some seeking to dramatise actual scenes from the attack.Vedika Bahl, a journalist with France 24, said the Pahalgam attacks had prompted a sharp ""uptake in misinformation from both sides surrounding the conflict"".""Lots of this misinformation begins on X,"" she said.

122,Villagers tell BBC they survived shelling in Indian-administered Kashmir,"In the village of Salamabad in Indian-administered Kashmir on Wednesday morning, ruined homes were still smouldering.This small settlement lies close to the Line of Control which separates Indian-administered and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, the scene of rapidly escalating tensions in recent weeks that led to strikes from India on sites in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir on Tuesday night.The streets of Salamabad were almost completely empty the next morning. Locals said the village was struck by Pakistani shelling.Most of the residents had fled the bombardment, leaving chickens pecking in their cages in gardens.Bashir Ahmad, a local shopkeeper who witnessed the destruction, told the BBC that around 02:00 local time (20:30 GMT), ""while we were fast asleep, a loud explosion jolted us awake.Mortar shells had landed near a water dam, and by 03:00 more shells struck several houses, setting them ablaze.The government issued no warning or advisory about the cross-border shelling, and we have no safety bunkers to take shelter in.""Salamabad is no stranger to this kind of shelling: until 2021, incidents of cross-border fire were reported regularly.However, a ceasefire agreement signed between the militaries of both countries saw the number of attacks sharply decrease.Life returned to normal for most, free of fear - that was, until Wednesday morning.Uncertainty now hangs over the villages scattered along the Line of Control once more.Mr Ahmad estimated that only a handful of Salamabad's 100 or so residents had remained, the rest having left in search of safety from what he described as the most intense shelling in years.In the village, two homes had been torn apart by mortars.Through a hole in the wall of one house, some crockery had remained impossibly upright on a shelf - while everything else around lay shattered or burned.The small homes were no match for the scale of the firepower they encountered overnight.They had been entirely hollowed out by explosions and fire, their tin roofs buckled above them.At a hospital 40km away, Badrudin said he was injured in the shelling, along with this eight-year-old son and sister-in-law.He identified one of the destroyed houses in a picture as his.He said: ""We were all in deep sleep when... a mortar shell landed near our homes. The children were also asleep.The shelling was intense, we somehow managed to flee.""Badrudin said he had taken out a loan of ₹3 lakh ($3,540 ; £2,653) to build his home in Salamabad.""Everything is gone now,"" he said.

124,What happens next between India and Pakistan? Four key questions,"In a dramatic overnight operation, India said it launched missile and air strikes on  nine sites across Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, targeting what it called militant positions based on ""credible intelligence"".The strikes, lasting just 25 minutes between 01:05 and 01:30 India time (19:35 and 20:00 GMT on Tuesday), sent shockwaves through the region, with residents jolted awake by thunderous explosions.Pakistan said only six locations were hit and claimed to have shot down five Indian fighter jets and a drone - a claim India has not confirmed.Islamabad said 26 people were killed and 46 injured in Indian air strikes and shelling across the Line of Control (LoC) - the de facto border between India and Pakistan. Meanwhile, India's army reported that 10 civilians were killed by Pakistani shelling on its side of the de facto border.This sharp escalation comes after last month's deadly militant attack on tourists in Pahalgam in Indian-administered Kashmir, pushing tensions between the nuclear-armed rivals to dangerous new heights. India says it has clear evidence linking Pakistan-based terrorists and external actors to the attack - a claim Pakistan flatly denies. Islamabad has also pointed out that India has not offered any evidence to support its claim.In 2016, after 19 Indian soldiers were killed in Uri, India launched ""surgical strikes"" across the LoC.In 2019, the Pulwama bombing, which left 40 Indian paramilitary personnel dead, prompted airstrikes deep into Balakot - the first such action inside Pakistan since 1971 - sparking retaliatory raids and an aerial dogfight.Experts say the retaliation for the Pahalgam attack stands out for its broader scope, targeting the infrastructure of three major Pakistan-based militant groups simultaneously.India says it struck nine militant targets across Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, hitting deep into key hubs of Lashkar-e- Taiba (LeT), Jaish-e-Mohammed, and Hizbul Mujahideen.Among the closest targets were two camps in Sialkot, just 6-18km from the border, according to an Indian spokesperson.The deepest hit, says India, was a Jaish-e-Mohammed headquarters in Bahawalpur, 100km inside Pakistan. A LeT camp in Muzaffarabad, 30km from the LoC and capital of Pakistan-administered Kashmir, was linked to recent attacks in Indian-administered Kashmir, the spokesperson said.Pakistan says six locations have been hit, but denies allegations of there being terror camps.""What's striking this time is the expansion of India's targets beyond past patterns. Previously, strikes like Balakot focused on Pakistan-administered Kashmir across the Line of Control - a militarised boundary,"" Srinath Raghavan, a Delhi-based historian, told the BBC.""This time, India has hit into Pakistan's Punjab, across the International Border, targeting terrorist infrastructure, headquarters, and known locations in Bahawalpur and Muridke linked to Lashkar-e-Taiba. They've also struck Jaish-e-Mohammed and Hizbul Mujahideen assets. This suggests a broader, more geographically expansive response, signalling that multiple groups are now in India's crosshairs - and sending a wider message,"" he says.The India-Pakistan International Border is the officially recognised boundary separating the two countries, stretching from Gujarat to Jammu.Ajay Bisaria, a former Indian high commissioner to Pakistan, told the BBC that what India did was a ""Balakot plus response meant to establish deterrence, targeting known terrorist hubs, but accompanied by a strong de-escalatory message"".""These strikes were more precise, targeted and more visible than in the past. Therefore, [they are] less deniable by Pakistan,"" Mr Bisaria says.Indian sources say the strikes were aimed at ""re-establishing deterrence"".""The Indian government thinks that the deterrence established in 2019 has worn thin and needs to be re-established,"" says Prof Raghavan.""This seems to mirror Israel's doctrine that deterrence requires periodic, repeated strikes. But if we assume that hitting back alone will deter terrorism, we risk giving Pakistan every incentive to retaliate - and that can quickly spiral out of control.""The majority of experts agree that a retaliation from Pakistan is inevitable - and diplomacy will come into play.""Pakistan's response is sure to come. The challenge would be to manage the next level of escalation. This is where crisis diplomacy will matter,"" says Mr Bisaria.""Pakistan will be getting advice to exercise restraint. But the key will be the diplomacy after the Pakistani response to ensure that both countries don't rapidly climb the ladder of escalation.""Pakistan-based experts like Ejaz Hussain, a Lahore-based political and military analyst, say Indian surgical strikes targeting locations such as Muridke and Bahawalpur were ""largely anticipated given the prevailing tensions"".Dr Hussain believes retaliatory strikes are likely.""Given the Pakistani military's media rhetoric and stated resolve to settle the scores, retaliatory action, possibly in the form of surgical strikes across the border, appears likely in the coming days,"" he told the BBC.But Dr Hussain worries that surgical strikes on both sides could ""escalate into a limited conventional war"".Christopher Clary of the University at Albany in the US believes given the scale of India's strikes, ""visible damage at key sites"", and reported casualties, Pakistan is highly likely to retaliate.""Doing otherwise essentially would give India permission to strike Pakistan whenever Delhi feels aggrieved and would run contrary to the Pakistan military's commitment to retaliating with 'quid pro quo plus',"" Mr Clary, who studies the politics of South Asia, told the BBC.""Given India's stated targets of groups and facilities associated with terrorism and militancy in India, I think it is likely - but far from certain - that Pakistan will confine itself to attacks on Indian military targets,"" he said.Despite the rising tensions, some experts still hold out hope for de-escalation.""There is a decent chance we escape this crisis with just one round of reciprocal standoff strikes and a period of heightened firing along the Line of Control,"" says Mr Clary.However, the risk of further escalation remains high, making this the ""most dangerous"" India-Pakistan crisis since 2002 - and even more perilous than the 2016 and 2019 standoffs, he adds.Experts in Pakistan note that despite a lack of war hysteria leading up to India's strike, the situation could quickly shift.""We have a deeply fractured political society, with the country's most popular leader behind bars. Imran Khan's imprisonment triggered a strong anti-military public backlash,"" says Umer Farooq, an Islamabad-based analyst and a former correspondent of Jane's Defence Weekly.""Today, the Pakistani public is far less eager to support the military compared to 2016 or 2019 - the usual wave of war hysteria is noticeably absent. But if public opinion shifts in central Punjab where anti-India feelings are more prevalent, we could see increased civilian pressure on the military to take action. And the military will regain popularity because of this conflict.""Dr Hussain echoes a similar sentiment.""I believe the current standoff with India presents an opportunity for the Pakistani military to regain public support, particularly from the urban middle classes who have recently criticised it for perceived political interference,"" he says.""The military's active defence posture is already being amplified through mainstream and social media, with some outlets claiming that six or seven Indian jets were shot down.""Although these claims warrant independent verification, they serve to bolster the military's image among segments of the public that conventionally rally around national defence narratives in times of external threat.""India is once again walking a fine line between escalation and restraint.Shortly after the attack in Pahalgam, India swiftly retaliated by closing the main border crossing, suspending a water-sharing treaty, expelling diplomats and halting most visas for Pakistani nationals. Troops on both sides have exchanged small-arms fire, and India barred all Pakistani aircraft from its airspace, mirroring Pakistan's earlier move. In response, Pakistan suspended a 1972 peace treaty and took its own retaliatory measures.This mirrors India's actions after the 2019 Pulwama attack, when it swiftly revoked Pakistan's most-favoured-nation status, imposed heavy tariffs and suspended key trade and transport links.The crisis had escalated when India launched air strikes on Balakot, followed by retaliatory Pakistani air raids and the capture of Indian pilot Abhinandan Varthaman, further heightening tensions. However, diplomatic channels eventually led to a de-escalation, with Pakistan releasing the pilot in a goodwill gesture.""India was willing to give old-fashioned diplomacy another chance....

125,Indian and Pakistani civilians describe aftermath of strikes and shelling,"Mohammed Waheed was fast asleep at his home in Pakistan-administered Kashmir in the early hours of Wednesday morning when a huge blast shook his home.""Before we could even process what was happening, more missiles struck, causing widespread panic and chaos,"" he told the BBC, adding that he had jumped out of bed and run outside along with his family and neighbours.""Children were crying, women were running around, trying to find safety.""Mr Waheed lives in Muzaffarabad, the capital of Pakistan-administered Kashmir - it is one of at least three places that were hit by Indian missile strikes on Wednesday.The Indian military said it carried out the strikes in response to a militant attack in Indian-administered Kashmir that killed 26 civilians. It has blamed Pakistan-based militant groups for the attacks, accusing Islamabad of tacitly supporting them - a charge Pakistan has consistently denied.The BBC spoke to witnesses in both Indian and Pakistan administered Kashmir who described the strikes by India as well as the aftermath of shelling by Pakistan.Pakistan said eight civilians were killed and 35 others injured as a result of the strikes this morning, according to Islamabad.India's army has also said that at least seven civilians have been killed by Pakistani shelling on its side of the Line of Control (LoC) - the de facto border between both countries.Ruby Kaur, who lived in India's Poonch district along the LoC has been identified as one of the Indians who has been killed.Her uncle, Buava Singh, told the BBC that a mortar shell struck near Ms Kaur's house around 1:45 am, killing her on the spot and injuring her daughter.""Her husband was not keeping well. She woke up to make tea for him when the mortar shell landed close to her house,"" he said.He added that the heavy shelling on Wednesday morning was something ""we have never seen so far"". Singh says that there were no community bunkers in the area, which meant residents were forced to take shelter in their homes.""The shrapnel hit her head. She was bleeding heavily. We rushed her to a nearby hospital, but she was declared dead,"" Mr Singh said.Another resident from Poonch said they heard ""loud explosions for hours on Wednesday night"".""It was a panicky situation across the city and other areas close to the Line of Control (LoC),"" Dr Zamrood Mughal said over phone.""People couldn't sleep the entire night.

126,'We are too scared to go back': Kashmiris in India face violence after deadly attack,"Shabir Ahmad Dar, a resident of Indian-administered Kashmir, has been selling pashmina shawls for more than 20 years.The intricately embroidered featherweight scarves are a favourite with his customers in Mussoorie, a hill town in the northern state of Uttarakhand, where he works.For his buyers, the shawls are a sign of luxury. For Dar, they are a metaphor for home; its traditional patterns layered with history and a mark of his Kashmiri identity.But lately, the same identity feels like a curse.On Sunday, Dar, along with another salesman, was publicly harassed and assaulted by members of a Hindu right-wing group, who were reportedly incensed by the killing of 26 people at a popular tourist spot in Kashmir last week. India has blamed Pakistan for the attack - a charge Islamabad denies.A video of the assault shows the men thrashing and hurling abuses at Dar and his friend as they ransack their stall, located on a busy boulevard.""They blamed us for the attack, told us to leave town and never show our faces again,"" said Dar.He says his goods, worth thousands of dollars, are still lying there. ""But we are too scared to go back.""As outrage over the assault spread, police on Wednesday arrested the three men but released them a few hours later after charging a fine and asking them to ""apologise"" to Dar and his colleague.But Dar had already left by then, along with dozens of other Kashmiri shawl sellers, who, after living in Mussoorie for decades, say they no longer feel safe there.Many survivors of the Pahalgam attack -  the deadliest targeting civilians in recent years - said the militants specifically targeted Hindu men, sparking an outpouring of anger and grief in India, with politicians across party lines demanding strict action.Since then, there have been more than a dozen reports of Kashmiri vendors and students in Indian cities facing harassment, vilification and threats from right-wing groups - but also from their own classmates, customers and neighbours. Videos showing students being chased out of campus and beaten up on the streets have been cascading online.On Thursday, one of the survivors, whose naval officer husband was killed in the militant attack, appealed to people to not go after Muslims and Kashmiris. ""We want peace and only peace,"" she said.But safety concerns have forced many Kashmiris like Dar to return home.Ummat Shabir, a nursing student at a university in Punjab state, said some women in her neighbourhood accused her of being a ""terrorist who should be thrown out"" last week.""The same day, my classmate was forced out of a taxi by her driver after he found out she was a Kashmiri,"" she said. ""It took us three days to travel back to Kashmir but we had no option. We had to go.""Ms Shabir is back in her hometown but for many others, even home does not feel safe anymore.As the search for the perpetrators of last week's attack continues, security forces in Kashmir have detained thousands of people, shut off more than 50 tourist destinations, sent in additional army and paramilitary troops, and blown up several homes belonging to families of suspected militants who they accuse of having ""terrorist affiliations"".The crackdown has sparked fear and unease among civilians, many of whom have called the actions a form of ""collective punishment"" against them.Without mentioning the demolitions, Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah said the guilty must be punished without mercy, ""but don't let innocent people become collateral damage"". Former chief minister Mehbooba Mufti also criticised the demolitions, cautioning the government to distinguish between ""terrorists and civilians"".""Whenever tensions escalate, we are the first ones to bear the brunt of it. But we are still treated as suspects and expected to put our lives on hold,"" another student, who wanted to remain anonymous, told the BBC.Yet the backlash feels a lot worse this time, says Shafi Subhan, a shawl seller from the region's Kupwara district, who also worked in Mussoorie.In his 20 years of doing business there, Subhan said he had never faced any public threat - not even after the 2019 terror attack in Pulwama district, which killed 40 paramilitary police troopers.To him, Mussoorie felt like home, a place where he found peace - despite being hundreds of kilometres away. He said he shared an emotional bond with his customers, who came from all parts of the country""People were always kind to us, they wore our garments with so much joy,"" Subhan recalled. ""But on that day when our colleagues were attacked, no one came to help. The public just stood and watched. It hurt them physically - but emotionally, a lot more.""Back home in Kashmir, peace has long been fragile. Both India and Pakistan claim the territory in full but administer separate parts, and an armed insurgency has simmered in the Indian-administered region for more than three decades, claiming thousands of lives.Caught in between, are civilians who say they feel stuck in an endless limbo that feels especially suffocating, whenever ties between India and Pakistan come under strain.Many allege that in the past, military confrontations between the nations have been followed by waves of harassment and violence against Kashmiris, along with a significant security and communication clampdown in the region.In recent years, violence has declined, and officials point to improved infrastructure, tourism, and investment as signs of greater stability, particularly since 2019, when the region's special constitutional status was revoked under Article 370.But arrests and security operations continue, and critics argue that calm has come at the cost of civil liberties and political freedoms.""The needle of suspicion is always on locals, even as militancy has declined in the last one-and-a-half decades,"" says Anuradha Bhasin, the managing editor of the Kashmir Times newspapers. ""They always have to prove their innocence.""As the news of the killings spread last week, Kashmiris poured onto the streets, holding candlelight vigils and protest marches. A complete shutdown was observed a day after the attack and newspapers printed black front pages. Omar Abdullah publicly apologised, saying he had ""failed his guests"".Ms Bhasin says Kashmiri backlash against such attacks is not new; there has been similar condemnation in the past as well, although at a smaller scale. ""No one there condones civilian killings - they know the pain of losing loved ones too well.""But she adds that it's unfair to place the burden of proving innocence on Kashmiris, when they have themselves become targets of hate and violence. ""This would just instil more fear and further alienate people, many of whom already feel isolated from the rest of the country.""Mirza Waheed, a Kashmiri novelist, believes Kashmiris are ""particularly vulnerable as they are seen through a different lens"", being part of India's Muslim population.""The saddest part is many of them will suffer the indignity and humiliation, lay low for some time, and wait for this to tide over because they have a life to live.""No one knows this better Mohammad Shafi Dar, a daily wage worker in Kashmir's Shopian, whose house was blown up by security forces last week.Five days on, he is still picking the up the pieces.""We lost everything,"" said Dar, who is now living under the open sky with his wife, three daughters and son. ""We don't even have utensils to cook food.""He says his family has no idea where their other 20-year-old son is, whether he joined militancy, or is even dead or alive. His parents say the college student left home last October and never returned. They haven't spoken since.""Yet, we have been punished for his alleged crimes.

127,India and Pakistan are in crisis again - here's how they de-escalated in the past,"Last week's deadly militant attack in Pahalgam in Indian-administered Kashmir, which claimed 26 civilian lives, has reignited a grim sense of déjà vu for India's security forces and diplomats.This is familiar ground. In 2016, after 19 Indian soldiers were killed in Uri, India launched ""surgical strikes"" across the Line of Control – the de facto border between India and Pakistan - targeting militant bases.In 2019, the Pulwama bombing, which left 40 Indian paramilitary personnel dead, prompted airstrikes deep into Balakot - the first such action inside Pakistan since 1971 - sparking retaliatory raids and an aerial dogfight.And before that, the horrific 2008 Mumbai attacks - a 60-hour siege on hotels, a railway station, and a Jewish centre - claimed 166 lives.Each time, India has held Pakistan-based militant groups responsible for the attacks, accusing Islamabad of tacitly supporting them - a charge Pakistan has consistently denied.Since 2016, and especially after the 2019 airstrikes, the threshold for escalation has shifted dramatically. Cross-border and aerial strikes by India have become the new norm, provoking retaliation from Pakistan. This has further intensified an already volatile situation.Once again, experts say, India finds itself walking the tightrope between escalation and restraint - a fragile balance of response and deterrence. One person who understands this recurring cycle is Ajay Bisaria, India's former high commissioner to Pakistan during the Pulwama attack, who captured its aftermath in his memoir, Anger Management: The Troubled Diplomatic Relationship between India and Pakistan.""There are striking parallels between the aftermath of the Pulwama bombing and the killings in Pahalgam,"" Mr Bisaria told me on Thursday, 10 days after the latest attack.Yet, he notes, Pahalgam marks a shift. Unlike Pulwama and Uri, which targeted security forces, this attack struck civilians - tourists from across India - evoking memories of the 2008 Mumbai attacks. ""This attack carries elements of Pulwama, but much more of Mumbai,"" he explains.""We're once again in a conflict situation, and the story is unfolding in much the same way,"" Mr Bisaria says.A week after the latest attack, Delhi moved quickly with retaliatory measures: closing the main border crossing, suspending a key water-sharing treaty, expelling diplomats, and halting most visas for Pakistani nationals - who were given days to leave. Troops on both sides have exchanged intermittent small-arms fire across the border in recent days.Delhi also barred all Pakistani aircraft - commercial and military - from its airspace, mirroring Islamabad's earlier move. Pakistan retaliated with its own visa suspensions and suspended a 1972 peace treaty with India. (Kashmir, claimed in full by both India and Pakistan but administered in parts by each, has been a flashpoint between the two nuclear-armed nations since their partition in 1947.)In his memoir, Mr Bisaria recounts India's response after the Pulwama attack on 14 February 2019.He was summoned to Delhi the morning after, as the government moved quickly to halt trade - revoking Pakistan's most-favoured-nation status, granted in 1996. In the following days, the Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) imposed a 200% customs duty on Pakistani goods, effectively ending imports, and suspended trade at the land border at  Wagah.Mr Bisaria notes that a broader set of measures was also proposed to scale down engagement with Pakistan, most of which were subsequently implemented.They included suspending a cross-border train known as the Samjhauta Express, and a bus service linking Delhi and Lahore; deferring talks between border guards on both sides and negotiations over the historic Kartarpur corridor to one of Sikhism's holiest shrines, halting visa issuance, ceasing cross border, banning Indian travel to Pakistan, and suspending flights between the two countries.""How hard it was to build trust, I thought. And how easy was it to break it,"" Mr Bisaria writes.""All the confidence-building measures planned, negotiated, and implemented over years in this difficult relationship, could be slashed off on a yellow notepad in minutes.""The strength of the Indian high commission in Islamabad was reduced from 110 to 55 only in June 2020 after a separate diplomatic incident. (It now stands at 30 after the Pahalgam attack.) India also launched a diplomatic offensive.A day after the attack, then foreign secretary Vijay Gokhale briefed envoys from 25 countries - including the US, UK, China, Russia, and France - on the role of Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM), the Pakistan-based militant group behind the bombing, and accused Pakistan of using terrorism as state policy. JeM, designated a terrorist organisation by India, the UN, the UK, and the US, had claimed responsibility for the bombing.India's diplomatic offensive continued on 25 February, 10 days after the attack, pushing for JeM chief Masood Azhar's designation as a terrorist by the UN sanctions committee and inclusion on the EU's ""autonomous terror list"".While there was pressure to abrogate the Indus Waters Treaty - a key river water sharing agreement - India opted instead to withhold any data beyond treaty obligations, Mr Bisaria writes. A total of 48 bilateral agreements were reviewed for possible suspension. An all-party meeting was convened in Delhi, resulting in a unanimous resolution.At the same time, communication channels remained open - including the hotline between the two countries' Directors General of Military Operations (DGMO), a key link for military-to-military contact, as well as both high commissions. In 2019, as now, Pakistan said the attack was a ""false-flag operation"".Much like this time a crackdown in Kashmir saw the arrest of over 80 ""overground workers"" - local supporters who may have provided logistical help, shelter, and intelligence to militants from the Pakistan-based group. Rajnath Singh, then Indian home minister, visited Jammu and Kashmir, and dossiers on the attack and suspected perpetrators were prepared.In a meeting with the external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj, Mr Bisaria told her that ""that India's diplomatic options in dealing with a terrorist attack of this nature was limited"".""She gave me the impression that some tough action was round the corner, after which, I should expect the role of diplomacy to expand,"" Mr Bisaria writes.On 26 February, Indian airstrikes - its first across the international border since 1971 - targeted JeM's training camp in Balakot.Six hours later, the Indian foreign secretary announced the strikes had killed ""a very large number"" of militants and commanders. Pakistan swiftly denied the claim. More high-level meetings followed in Delhi.The crisis escalated dramatically the next morning, 27 February, when Pakistan launched retaliatory air raids.In the ensuing dogfight, an Indian fighter jet was shot down, and its pilot, Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman, ejected and landed in Pakistan-administered Kashmir. Captured by Pakistani forces, his detention in enemy territory triggered a wave of national concern and further heightened tensions between the two nuclear-armed neighbours.Mr Bisaria writes India activated multiple diplomatic channels, with US and UK envoys pressing Islamabad. The Indian message was ""any attempt by Pakistan to escalate situation further or to cause harm to the pilot would lead to escalation by India.""Pakistani prime minister Imran Khan announced the pilot's release on 28 February, with the handover occurring on 1 March under prisoner of war protocol. Pakistan presented the move as a ""goodwill gesture"" aimed at de-escalating tensions.By 5 March, with the dust settling from Pulwama, Balakot, and the pilot's return, India's political temperature had cooled. The Cabinet Committee on Security decided to send India's high commissioner back to Pakistan, signalling a shift towards diplomacy.""I arrived in Islamabad on 10 March, 22 days after leaving in the wake of Pulwama. The most serious military exchange since Kargil had run its course in less than a month,"" Mr Bisaria writes,""India was willing to give old-fashioned diplomacy another chance.... This, with India having achieved a strategic and military objective and Pakistan having claimed a notion of victory for its domestic audience.""Mr Bisaria described it as a ""testing and fascinating time"" to be a diplomat. This time, he notes, the key difference is that the targets were Indian civilians, and the attack occurred ""ironically, when the situation in Kashmir had dramatically improved"".He views escalation as inevitable, but notes there's also a ""de-escalation instinct alongside the escalation instinct"". When the Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) meets during such conflicts, he says, their decisions weigh the conflict's economic impact and seek measures that hurt Pakistan without triggering a backlash against India.""The body language and optics are similar [this time],"" he says, but highlights what he sees as the most significant move: India's threat to annul the Indus Waters Treaty. ""If India acts on this, it would have long-term, serious consequences for Pakistan.""""Remember, we're still in the middle of a crisis,"" says Mr Bisaria.

128,India hunts suspects days after deadly Kashmir attack,"Authorities in Indian-administered Kashmir have demolished the houses of at least 10 alleged militants and detained more people for questioning as investigations continue into last week's killings of 26 people.Indian security forces have used explosives to destroy the properties since last Tuesday's attack on tourists. At least one was reportedly linked to a suspect named in the shootings.India accuses Pakistan of supporting militants behind the killings, but has named no group it blames. Islamabad rejects the allegations.It was the deadliest attack on civilians in two decades in the disputed territory. Both India and Pakistan claim the region and have fought two wars over it.Troops from both sides have traded intermittent small-arms fire across the border for the past few days.Speculation continues over whether India will respond with military strikes against Pakistan, as it did after deadly militant attacks in 2019 and 2016.Authorities said last week they had conducted extensive searches in Indian-administered Kashmir, detaining more than 1,500 people for questioning since the attack near the tourist town of Pahalgam. More people have been detained since then, although the numbers are unclear.Officials have not spoken publicly about the demolitions but the houses targeted reportedly belonged to families of alleged militants active in the region or those who have crossed over to Pakistan.The demolitions at various locations across the Muslim-majority Kashmir valley began last Thursday, with the most recent occurring overnight on Saturday into Sunday.The region's top leaders have supported action against alleged militants but questioned the demolitions of the homes of suspected militants' families.Without mentioning the demolitions, Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah said the guilty must be punished without mercy, ""but don't let innocent people become collateral damage"".Former chief minister Mehbooba Mufti also criticised the demolitions, cautioning the government to distinguish between ""terrorists and civilians"".Last November, India's Supreme Court banned so-called ""bulldozer justice"", a practice which has been on the rise in recent years in India.Since the Pahalgam attack, a number of Kashmiri students enrolled in colleges in different parts of India have also reported being attacked or threatened by locals, asking them to leave.Kashmir, which India and Pakistan claim in full but administer only in part, has been a flashpoint between the two nuclear-armed countries since they were partitioned in 1947.Indian-administered Kashmir has seen an armed insurgency against Indian rule since 1989, with militants targeting security forces and civilians alike.India has not named any group it suspects carried out the attack in Pahalgam and it remains unclear who did it. A little-known group called the Resistance Front, which was initially reported to have claimed it carried out the shootings, issued a statement denying involvement. The front is reportedly affiliated with Lashkar-e-Taiba, a Pakistan-based militant group.Indian police have named three of four suspected attackers. They said two were Pakistani nationals and one a local man from Indian-administered Kashmir. There is no information on the fourth man.Many survivors said the gunmen specifically targeted Hindu men.The attack has sparked widespread anger in India, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi publicly saying the country will hunt the suspects ""till the ends of the earth"" and that those who planned and carried it out ""will be punished beyond their imagination"".Tensions between India and Pakistan rose within hours of the killings, resulting in tit-for-tat measures.India immediately suspended the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty, a World Bank-brokered water sharing agreement between the two countries, prompting protests from Pakistan which said the stoppage or diversion of water would be ""considered as an act of war"".Pakistan retaliated further by suspending the 1972 Simla agreement in which both countries had promised to resolve their disputes by peaceful means through bilateral negotiations.The neighbours have also expelled many of each other's diplomats and revoked civilians' visas - already difficult to procure - leaving many stranded on both sides of the border. At least 500 Pakistani nationals, including diplomats and officials, have left India through the Attari-Wagah land border since the attack.As tensions spiral, India has alleged firing by Pakistan along the Line of Control, the de facto border between the two countries, for four nights in a row. Pakistan has not confirmed it yet.On Sunday, Modi repeated his promise to get justice to families of those killed in the attack, saying it was meant to disrupt the normalcy the region was returning to after years of violence.""The enemies of the country, of Jammu and Kashmir, did not like this,"" he said in his monthly radio address.Over the weekend, a US state department spokesperson told Reuters that Washington was in touch with the governments of India and Pakistan and wanted them to work towards a ""responsible resolution"", while the British foreign secretary David Lammy spoke to his counterparts in India and deputy prime minister in Pakistan.With additional reporting from Aamir Peerzada and Shafat Farooq in SrinagarFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook",Operation Sindoor,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g8yx6r3rlo,BBC,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""tonality"", ""reason"": ""The article's tone is predominantly critical of Pakistan and sympathetic to India's actions, using phrases like 'deadly Kashmir attack' and 'enemies of the country'.

129,Hope and fear as tourists trickle back to Kashmir town after attack,"One week after a devastating militant attack near the mountain resort of Pahalgam in Indian-administered Kashmir killed 26 people, the town wears a look of quiet desolation, although tourists have begun trickling back in small numbers.The main high street, abandoned by visitors last week - with shops shuttered and hotels completely emptied out - is seeing fleeting signs of life again.Last Tuesday, militants opened fire on people, mostly tourists, who were visiting Baisaran, a mountain-top meadow three miles (5 km) from Pahalgam, often described as the ""Switzerland of India"".The attack was one of the deadliest in recent years, devastating the lives of many families and sparking widespread anger in India.In the days since, tensions between India and Pakistan, which both claim Kashmir in full but administer it only in part, have significantly risen, with each side announcing retaliatory measures against the other.There is now growing speculation about whether there will be a military response from Delhi. The government in Kashmir has closed down over half the tourist destinations in the valley, as authorities review the security situation and carry out search operations.While violence has often broken out in the region, with militants targeting security forces and civilians since an insurgency broke out in 1989, the brazen killing of tourists has been rare and has shocked local businesses and tourists alike.Tourism is a mainstay of the economy in places like Pahalgam and there's now fear that many livelihoods might be irrevocably hit.At a ""selfie point"" outside town, overlooking lush meadows and a rushing river, Akshay Solanki, a tourist from Mumbai, said there was ""panic"" among his group of travellers on the day of the attack. But they had decided to continue with their journey because flights back home had become unaffordable.Other tourists said constant reassurances from the locals and security forces had given them a sense of comfort. A driver who had brought visitors from the capital, Srinagar, told BBC Hindi that he was pleading with those visiting not to ""distance"" themselves from Kashmir.After a washout three days, shawl-seller Rafi Ahmed said he'd managed to sell just a few pieces and feared for his livelihood in the long run if tourists stopped coming.Among those exhorting tourists to come to Pahalgam was Bollywood actor Atul Kulkarni, who visited the town days after the attack. He told BBC Hindi, if the message from the militants was ""don't come here, we should respond by coming in even larger numbers"".""Don't cancel bookings, cancel your other plans and come here,"" Kulkarni said.But uncertainty and apprehension loom large in Pahalgam and it could take several years before a sense of normalcy is restored, local business owners and residents told the BBC.Indian authorities have launched combing operations in the region, detaining hundreds of people and destroying homes belonging to alleged militants.India and Pakistan have also reportedly exchanged small arms fire across the border.The escalation in tensions is keeping tourists and business owners on tenterhooks.Indian authorities have often claimed Kashmir witnessed a period of relative peace after Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government revoked its autonomous status in 2019. Ahead of India's general elections in 2024, Modi hailed the ""freedom"" that had come to the region, saying Kashmir was touching new heights of development because it was breathing freely.Top leaders pointed to high tourism numbers - some 23 million last year and millions more in the years before - as proof of a big boom after years of unquiet. But last week's attacks have, yet again, shattered any idea of lasting peace in the restive valley.""This [attack] is a blot on us…How we wipe it off is a long-term concern,"" Rafi Ahmed Meer, a politician from Pahalgam told BBC Hindi, urging tourists to remember that it was local Kashmiris who rushed to help after the attacks, even picking up bodies.The cancellation rate for trips planned from cities like Pune, Mumbai and Bengaluru are very high, Abhishek Sansare, a Mumbai-based tour operator told the BBC. A group of prominent tour operators said in a press conference that some 80-90% of all bookings had been cancelled.""After the attack, there's a sense that a war is looming. So tourists are confused about what to do,"" said Sansare. ""Some of those who've already made advance bookings are going ahead with their plans. I'm also going there on the 2nd of next month.""The attack on tourists is also likely to weigh on Kashmir in other ways. The inauguration of the world's highest single-arch rail bridge, set to connect the Kashmir valley with the rest of India was slated to happen this month after several delays.The timeline for the opening of this showpiece project now ""looks uncertain"", a source told the BBC.The region was just beginning to attract fledgling business investments, but those too could dry up if hostilities go up.""People who were investing in logistics and other sectors will now think twice because of the security environment.

132,Pakistan suspends visas for Indians after deadly Kashmir attack,"Pakistan has responded with tit-for-tat measures against India as tensions soared following a militant attack in Indian-administered Kashmir that killed 26 tourists.Islamabad suspended all visas issued to Indian nationals under an exemption scheme with immediate effect, as well as expelling some of its neighbour's diplomats and closing its airspace to Indian flights.Indian police have named three of four suspected gunmen behind the attack, saying two are Pakistani citizens and a third is a local Kashmiri man. Pakistan denies Indian claims that it played a role in the shooting.Tuesday's attack saw a group of gunmen fire on tourists near Pahalgam, a resort in the disputed Himalayan region.Police in Indian-administered Kashmir say all three suspects named are members of the Pakistan-based militant group Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT).

133,India and Pakistan are in crisis again - here's how they de-escalated in the past,"Last week's deadly militant attack in Pahalgam in Indian-administered Kashmir, which claimed 26 civilian lives, has reignited a grim sense of déjà vu for India's security forces and diplomats.This is familiar ground. In 2016, after 19 Indian soldiers were killed in Uri, India launched ""surgical strikes"" across the Line of Control – the de facto border between India and Pakistan - targeting militant bases.In 2019, the Pulwama bombing, which left 40 Indian paramilitary personnel dead, prompted airstrikes deep into Balakot - the first such action inside Pakistan since 1971 - sparking retaliatory raids and an aerial dogfight.And before that, the horrific 2008 Mumbai attacks - a 60-hour siege on hotels, a railway station, and a Jewish centre - claimed 166 lives.Each time, India has held Pakistan-based militant groups responsible for the attacks, accusing Islamabad of tacitly supporting them - a charge Pakistan has consistently denied.Since 2016, and especially after the 2019 airstrikes, the threshold for escalation has shifted dramatically. Cross-border and aerial strikes by India have become the new norm, provoking retaliation from Pakistan. This has further intensified an already volatile situation.Once again, experts say, India finds itself walking the tightrope between escalation and restraint - a fragile balance of response and deterrence. One person who understands this recurring cycle is Ajay Bisaria, India's former high commissioner to Pakistan during the Pulwama attack, who captured its aftermath in his memoir, Anger Management: The Troubled Diplomatic Relationship between India and Pakistan.""There are striking parallels between the aftermath of the Pulwama bombing and the killings in Pahalgam,"" Mr Bisaria told me on Thursday, 10 days after the latest attack.Yet, he notes, Pahalgam marks a shift. Unlike Pulwama and Uri, which targeted security forces, this attack struck civilians - tourists from across India - evoking memories of the 2008 Mumbai attacks. ""This attack carries elements of Pulwama, but much more of Mumbai,"" he explains.""We're once again in a conflict situation, and the story is unfolding in much the same way,"" Mr Bisaria says.A week after the latest attack, Delhi moved quickly with retaliatory measures: closing the main border crossing, suspending a key water-sharing treaty, expelling diplomats, and halting most visas for Pakistani nationals - who were given days to leave. Troops on both sides have exchanged intermittent small-arms fire across the border in recent days.Delhi also barred all Pakistani aircraft - commercial and military - from its airspace, mirroring Islamabad's earlier move. Pakistan retaliated with its own visa suspensions and suspended a 1972 peace treaty with India. (Kashmir, claimed in full by both India and Pakistan but administered in parts by each, has been a flashpoint between the two nuclear-armed nations since their partition in 1947.)In his memoir, Mr Bisaria recounts India's response after the Pulwama attack on 14 February 2019.He was summoned to Delhi the morning after, as the government moved quickly to halt trade - revoking Pakistan's most-favoured-nation status, granted in 1996. In the following days, the Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) imposed a 200% customs duty on Pakistani goods, effectively ending imports, and suspended trade at the land border at  Wagah.Mr Bisaria notes that a broader set of measures was also proposed to scale down engagement with Pakistan, most of which were subsequently implemented.They included suspending a cross-border train known as the Samjhauta Express, and a bus service linking Delhi and Lahore; deferring talks between border guards on both sides and negotiations over the historic Kartarpur corridor to one of Sikhism's holiest shrines, halting visa issuance, ceasing cross border, banning Indian travel to Pakistan, and suspending flights between the two countries.""How hard it was to build trust, I thought. And how easy was it to break it,"" Mr Bisaria writes.""All the confidence-building measures planned, negotiated, and implemented over years in this difficult relationship, could be slashed off on a yellow notepad in minutes.""The strength of the Indian high commission in Islamabad was reduced from 110 to 55 only in June 2020 after a separate diplomatic incident. (It now stands at 30 after the Pahalgam attack.) India also launched a diplomatic offensive.A day after the attack, then foreign secretary Vijay Gokhale briefed envoys from 25 countries - including the US, UK, China, Russia, and France - on the role of Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM), the Pakistan-based militant group behind the bombing, and accused Pakistan of using terrorism as state policy. JeM, designated a terrorist organisation by India, the UN, the UK, and the US, had claimed responsibility for the bombing.India's diplomatic offensive continued on 25 February, 10 days after the attack, pushing for JeM chief Masood Azhar's designation as a terrorist by the UN sanctions committee and inclusion on the EU's ""autonomous terror list"".While there was pressure to abrogate the Indus Waters Treaty - a key river water sharing agreement - India opted instead to withhold any data beyond treaty obligations, Mr Bisaria writes. A total of 48 bilateral agreements were reviewed for possible suspension. An all-party meeting was convened in Delhi, resulting in a unanimous resolution.At the same time, communication channels remained open - including the hotline between the two countries' Directors General of Military Operations (DGMO), a key link for military-to-military contact, as well as both high commissions. In 2019, as now, Pakistan said the attack was a ""false-flag operation"".Much like this time a crackdown in Kashmir saw the arrest of over 80 ""overground workers"" - local supporters who may have provided logistical help, shelter, and intelligence to militants from the Pakistan-based group. Rajnath Singh, then Indian home minister, visited Jammu and Kashmir, and dossiers on the attack and suspected perpetrators were prepared.In a meeting with the external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj, Mr Bisaria told her that ""that India's diplomatic options in dealing with a terrorist attack of this nature was limited"".""She gave me the impression that some tough action was round the corner, after which, I should expect the role of diplomacy to expand,"" Mr Bisaria writes.On 26 February, Indian airstrikes - its first across the international border since 1971 - targeted JeM's training camp in Balakot.Six hours later, the Indian foreign secretary announced the strikes had killed ""a very large number"" of militants and commanders. Pakistan swiftly denied the claim. More high-level meetings followed in Delhi.The crisis escalated dramatically the next morning, 27 February, when Pakistan launched retaliatory air raids.In the ensuing dogfight, an Indian fighter jet was shot down, and its pilot, Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman, ejected and landed in Pakistan-administered Kashmir. Captured by Pakistani forces, his detention in enemy territory triggered a wave of national concern and further heightened tensions between the two nuclear-armed neighbours.Mr Bisaria writes India activated multiple diplomatic channels, with US and UK envoys pressing Islamabad. The Indian message was ""any attempt by Pakistan to escalate situation further or to cause harm to the pilot would lead to escalation by India.""Pakistani prime minister Imran Khan announced the pilot's release on 28 February, with the handover occurring on 1 March under prisoner of war protocol. Pakistan presented the move as a ""goodwill gesture"" aimed at de-escalating tensions.By 5 March, with the dust settling from Pulwama, Balakot, and the pilot's return, India's political temperature had cooled. The Cabinet Committee on Security decided to send India's high commissioner back to Pakistan, signalling a shift towards diplomacy.""I arrived in Islamabad on 10 March, 22 days after leaving in the wake of Pulwama. The most serious military exchange since Kargil had run its course in less than a month,"" Mr Bisaria writes,""India was willing to give old-fashioned diplomacy another chance.... This, with India having achieved a strategic and military objective and Pakistan having claimed a notion of victory for its domestic audience.""Mr Bisaria described it as a ""testing and fascinating time"" to be a diplomat. This time, he notes, the key difference is that the targets were Indian civilians, and the attack occurred ""ironically, when the situation in Kashmir had dramatically improved"".He views escalation as inevitable, but notes there's also a ""de-escalation instinct alongside the escalation instinct"". When the Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) meets during such conflicts, he says, their decisions weigh the conflict's economic impact and seek measures that hurt Pakistan without triggering a backlash against India.""The body language and optics are similar [this time],"" he says, but highlights what he sees as the most significant move: India's threat to annul the Indus Waters Treaty. ""If India acts on this, it would have long-term, serious consequences for Pakistan.""""Remember, we're still in the middle of a crisis,"" says Mr Bisaria.

134,India hunts suspects days after deadly Kashmir attack,"Authorities in Indian-administered Kashmir have demolished the houses of at least 10 alleged militants and detained more people for questioning as investigations continue into last week's killings of 26 people.Indian security forces have used explosives to destroy the properties since last Tuesday's attack on tourists. At least one was reportedly linked to a suspect named in the shootings.India accuses Pakistan of supporting militants behind the killings, but has named no group it blames. Islamabad rejects the allegations.It was the deadliest attack on civilians in two decades in the disputed territory. Both India and Pakistan claim the region and have fought two wars over it.Troops from both sides have traded intermittent small-arms fire across the border for the past few days.Speculation continues over whether India will respond with military strikes against Pakistan, as it did after deadly militant attacks in 2019 and 2016.Authorities said last week they had conducted extensive searches in Indian-administered Kashmir, detaining more than 1,500 people for questioning since the attack near the tourist town of Pahalgam. More people have been detained since then, although the numbers are unclear.Officials have not spoken publicly about the demolitions but the houses targeted reportedly belonged to families of alleged militants active in the region or those who have crossed over to Pakistan.The demolitions at various locations across the Muslim-majority Kashmir valley began last Thursday, with the most recent occurring overnight on Saturday into Sunday.The region's top leaders have supported action against alleged militants but questioned the demolitions of the homes of suspected militants' families.Without mentioning the demolitions, Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah said the guilty must be punished without mercy, ""but don't let innocent people become collateral damage"".Former chief minister Mehbooba Mufti also criticised the demolitions, cautioning the government to distinguish between ""terrorists and civilians"".Last November, India's Supreme Court banned so-called ""bulldozer justice"", a practice which has been on the rise in recent years in India.Since the Pahalgam attack, a number of Kashmiri students enrolled in colleges in different parts of India have also reported being attacked or threatened by locals, asking them to leave.Kashmir, which India and Pakistan claim in full but administer only in part, has been a flashpoint between the two nuclear-armed countries since they were partitioned in 1947.Indian-administered Kashmir has seen an armed insurgency against Indian rule since 1989, with militants targeting security forces and civilians alike.India has not named any group it suspects carried out the attack in Pahalgam and it remains unclear who did it. A little-known group called the Resistance Front, which was initially reported to have claimed it carried out the shootings, issued a statement denying involvement. The front is reportedly affiliated with Lashkar-e-Taiba, a Pakistan-based militant group.Indian police have named three of four suspected attackers. They said two were Pakistani nationals and one a local man from Indian-administered Kashmir. There is no information on the fourth man.Many survivors said the gunmen specifically targeted Hindu men.The attack has sparked widespread anger in India, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi publicly saying the country will hunt the suspects ""till the ends of the earth"" and that those who planned and carried it out ""will be punished beyond their imagination"".Tensions between India and Pakistan rose within hours of the killings, resulting in tit-for-tat measures.India immediately suspended the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty, a World Bank-brokered water sharing agreement between the two countries, prompting protests from Pakistan which said the stoppage or diversion of water would be ""considered as an act of war"".Pakistan retaliated further by suspending the 1972 Simla agreement in which both countries had promised to resolve their disputes by peaceful means through bilateral negotiations.The neighbours have also expelled many of each other's diplomats and revoked civilians' visas - already difficult to procure - leaving many stranded on both sides of the border. At least 500 Pakistani nationals, including diplomats and officials, have left India through the Attari-Wagah land border since the attack.As tensions spiral, India has alleged firing by Pakistan along the Line of Control, the de facto border between the two countries, for four nights in a row. Pakistan has not confirmed it yet.On Sunday, Modi repeated his promise to get justice to families of those killed in the attack, saying it was meant to disrupt the normalcy the region was returning to after years of violence.""The enemies of the country, of Jammu and Kashmir, did not like this,"" he said in his monthly radio address.Over the weekend, a US state department spokesperson told Reuters that Washington was in touch with the governments of India and Pakistan and wanted them to work towards a ""responsible resolution"", while the British foreign secretary David Lammy spoke to his counterparts in India and deputy prime minister in Pakistan.With additional reporting from Aamir Peerzada and Shafat Farooq in SrinagarFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook",Operation Sindoor,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g8yx6r3rlo,BBC,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""tonality"", ""reason"": ""The article's tone is predominantly critical of Pakistan and sympathetic to India's actions, using phrases like 'deadly Kashmir attack' and 'enemies of the country'.

135,Hope and fear as tourists trickle back to Kashmir town after attack,"One week after a devastating militant attack near the mountain resort of Pahalgam in Indian-administered Kashmir killed 26 people, the town wears a look of quiet desolation, although tourists have begun trickling back in small numbers.The main high street, abandoned by visitors last week - with shops shuttered and hotels completely emptied out - is seeing fleeting signs of life again.Last Tuesday, militants opened fire on people, mostly tourists, who were visiting Baisaran, a mountain-top meadow three miles (5 km) from Pahalgam, often described as the ""Switzerland of India"".The attack was one of the deadliest in recent years, devastating the lives of many families and sparking widespread anger in India.In the days since, tensions between India and Pakistan, which both claim Kashmir in full but administer it only in part, have significantly risen, with each side announcing retaliatory measures against the other.There is now growing speculation about whether there will be a military response from Delhi. The government in Kashmir has closed down over half the tourist destinations in the valley, as authorities review the security situation and carry out search operations.While violence has often broken out in the region, with militants targeting security forces and civilians since an insurgency broke out in 1989, the brazen killing of tourists has been rare and has shocked local businesses and tourists alike.Tourism is a mainstay of the economy in places like Pahalgam and there's now fear that many livelihoods might be irrevocably hit.At a ""selfie point"" outside town, overlooking lush meadows and a rushing river, Akshay Solanki, a tourist from Mumbai, said there was ""panic"" among his group of travellers on the day of the attack. But they had decided to continue with their journey because flights back home had become unaffordable.Other tourists said constant reassurances from the locals and security forces had given them a sense of comfort. A driver who had brought visitors from the capital, Srinagar, told BBC Hindi that he was pleading with those visiting not to ""distance"" themselves from Kashmir.After a washout three days, shawl-seller Rafi Ahmed said he'd managed to sell just a few pieces and feared for his livelihood in the long run if tourists stopped coming.Among those exhorting tourists to come to Pahalgam was Bollywood actor Atul Kulkarni, who visited the town days after the attack. He told BBC Hindi, if the message from the militants was ""don't come here, we should respond by coming in even larger numbers"".""Don't cancel bookings, cancel your other plans and come here,"" Kulkarni said.But uncertainty and apprehension loom large in Pahalgam and it could take several years before a sense of normalcy is restored, local business owners and residents told the BBC.Indian authorities have launched combing operations in the region, detaining hundreds of people and destroying homes belonging to alleged militants.India and Pakistan have also reportedly exchanged small arms fire across the border.The escalation in tensions is keeping tourists and business owners on tenterhooks.Indian authorities have often claimed Kashmir witnessed a period of relative peace after Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government revoked its autonomous status in 2019. Ahead of India's general elections in 2024, Modi hailed the ""freedom"" that had come to the region, saying Kashmir was touching new heights of development because it was breathing freely.Top leaders pointed to high tourism numbers - some 23 million last year and millions more in the years before - as proof of a big boom after years of unquiet. But last week's attacks have, yet again, shattered any idea of lasting peace in the restive valley.""This [attack] is a blot on us…How we wipe it off is a long-term concern,"" Rafi Ahmed Meer, a politician from Pahalgam told BBC Hindi, urging tourists to remember that it was local Kashmiris who rushed to help after the attacks, even picking up bodies.The cancellation rate for trips planned from cities like Pune, Mumbai and Bengaluru are very high, Abhishek Sansare, a Mumbai-based tour operator told the BBC. A group of prominent tour operators said in a press conference that some 80-90% of all bookings had been cancelled.""After the attack, there's a sense that a war is looming. So tourists are confused about what to do,"" said Sansare. ""Some of those who've already made advance bookings are going ahead with their plans. I'm also going there on the 2nd of next month.""The attack on tourists is also likely to weigh on Kashmir in other ways. The inauguration of the world's highest single-arch rail bridge, set to connect the Kashmir valley with the rest of India was slated to happen this month after several delays.The timeline for the opening of this showpiece project now ""looks uncertain"", a source told the BBC.The region was just beginning to attract fledgling business investments, but those too could dry up if hostilities go up.""People who were investing in logistics and other sectors will now think twice because of the security environment. Until they regain some confidence, I don't foresee investments coming to Kashmir immediately,"" said Ubair Shah, who owns one of Kashmir's largest cold storage facilities for fruits in Pulwama district in south Kashmir.As the region continues to boil over, local leaders have expressed deep anguish to the families who lost their loved ones.In an impassioned speech in the Jammu and Kashmir assembly on Monday, the state's chief minister and tourism minister Omar Abdullah paid tributes to the victims by reading out names of all the 26 people.He said people from every part of the country had come under attack, and while they'd come to Kashmir at his invitation he could not ensure their safe return.""I had no words to apologise to them. What could I say to the children who saw their father drenched in blood?

139,Data from India’s historic moon mission supports long-standing lunar theory,"The historic Chandrayaan-3 mission, which made India the fourth country to land on the moon one year ago Friday, has uncovered new evidence that supports a theory about early lunar history.When the mission landed in the moon’s southern high-latitude regions, near the lunar south pole, it deployed a small six-wheeled rover called Pragyan, which means wisdom in Sanskrit. The rover was equipped with science instruments that allowed it to analyze particles within the moon’s soil and measure the elements there.Pragyan made 23 measurements as it rolled along a 338-feet (103-meter) region of the lunar surface, located within 164 feet (50 meters) of Chandrayaan-3’s landing site, for about 10 days. The rover’s data marks the first measurements of elements within lunar soil near the south polar region.The rover detected a relatively uniform composition largely made of a rock called ferroan anorthosite, which is similar to samples taken from the moon’s equatorial region during the Apollo 16 mission in 1972.Researchers reported the findings in a study published Wednesday in the journal Nature.Lunar samples are helping scientists to solve mysteries that remain about how the moon has evolved over time, including how it formed during the early chaotic days of the solar system.The presence of similar rocks in different parts of the moon lends additional support to the decades-old hypothesis that the moon was once covered by an ancient ocean of magma, the study authors said.There are many theories about how the moon formed, but scientists mostly agree that about 4.5 billion years ago, a Mars-size object or a series of objects crashed into Earth and launched enough molten debris into space to create the moon.The first lunar samples collected during the Apollo 11 mission in 1969 led researchers to the theory that the moon was once a molten ball of magma.The 842 pounds (382 kilograms) of lunar rocks and soil returned to Earth by the Apollo missions in the late 1960s and early 1970s disproved ideas that the moon was a celestial body caught in Earth’s gravity, or that the moon formed alongside Earth from the same debris. The rock samples indicated that the moon was created about 60 million years after the solar system began to form, according to NASA.The magma ocean, likely hundreds to thousands of kilometers deep, persisted for about 100 million years, the space agency says. As the magma ocean cooled, crystals formed within it.Some rocks and minerals like ferroan anorthosite rose to the top to form the lunar crust and highlands, while other, denser magnesium-rich minerals like olivine sank deep below the surface into the mantle, said Noah Petro, NASA project scientist for both the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter and Artemis III. Petro was not involved in the new study.While the lunar crust has an average thickness of about 31 miles (50 kilometers), the lunar mantle beneath it reaches about 838 miles (1,350 kilometers) deep.All the minerals and rocks on the moon have a story to tell about lunar history, Petro said.When the Pragyan rover carried out its chemical composition investigation of lunar soil, it found a mix of ferroan anorthosite and other rock types, including minerals like olivine.The Chandrayaan-3 landing site, called Shiv Shakti Point, was about 217 miles (350 kilometers) away from the rim of the South Pole-Aitken Basin, considered the oldest crater on the moon.The research team believes an asteroid impact created the basin about 4.2 billion to 4.3 billion years ago and unearthed magnesium-rich minerals like olivine, mixing them into the lunar soil, said lead study author Santosh Vadawale, a professor at the Physical Research Laboratory in Ahmedabad, India.The researchers are continuing to investigate the presence of these minerals that likely originated in the moon’s mantle to provide more context for the moon’s origins and evolution, he said.The mission proves why it is crucial to send spacecraft to different lunar regions to understand the history of the moon, Vadawale said.“All previous successful landings on the moon have been limited to equatorial to mid-latitude regions,” he said. “Chandrayaan-3 is the first mission to have a successful landing in the polar regions of the moon and carry out in-situ analysis. These new measurements in previously unexplored areas further enhanced the confidence in the (lunar magma ocean) hypothesis.”Next, the Indian lunar exploration program wishes to explore permanently shadowed regions of the lunar poles and return samples for a detailed analysis in laboratories on Earth, Vadawale said.While erosion and the movement of tectonic plates have erased evidence of how Earth formed, the moon remains largely unchanged apart from impact craters, Petro said.“Every time we land on the lunar surface, it anchors that understanding to a specific spot, a specific location on the surface, which is very useful for testing all the models and hypotheses we have,” he said. “That hypothesis of a magma ocean drives so much of what we think about the moon, especially early in its history. The rover results from the Chandrayaan-3 mission add another surface data point.”Each mission not only adds another piece to the puzzle of understanding the moon but also affords insights into how Earth and other rocky planets like Mars formed. Scientists’ understanding of how the moon came to be drives models of how all planets form and change, including planets beyond our solar system, Petro said.And as more missions are planned to return to the lunar surface, it’s like the gift that keeps on giving, especially with the prospect of collecting samples from different regions, including the far side of the moon and the poles.“Every time we get a new piece of data,” Petro said, “it’s further garland on that gift.”",Chandrayaan-3,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/23/science/lunar-magma-ocean-chandrayaan-3/index.html,CNN,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""omission"", ""reason"": ""No counter-theories or opposing views are presented in the article."", ""confidence"": 0.8}",no,none,no omission bias is in scope here
140,India’s first solar observatory successfully reaches intended orbit,"The first Indian solar observatory has successfully reached its intended orbit, the country’s Space Research Organisation announced Saturday, as India seeks to cement its status as an emerging space superpower.The Aditya-L1 spacecraft safely arrived at Lagrange Point L1, the position in space with unobstructed views of the sun located about 1.5 million kilometers (almost a million miles) from Earth, paving the way for scientists to enhance their study of the Sun-Earth System.Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi applauded the “extraordinary feat” in a post on X on Saturday, adding that this “is a testament to the relentless dedication of our scientists in realizing among the most complex and intricate space missions.”The Aditya-L1 launched on September 2, less than two weeks after the ISRO made a historic landing of its Chandrayaan-3 spacecraft on the moon’s South Pole.The spacecraft is equipped with seven scientific instruments, four of which will be trained directly on the sun while the others will study solar wind particles and magnetic fields passing through at Lagrange Point L1.The main goals of the mission include studying the sun’s upper atmosphere and various solar phenomena, such as coronal mass ejections — or massive expulsions of plasma from the sun’s outermost layer.The information gleaned from Aditya-L1’s experiments will provide a clearer picture of space weather, or the term used to describe the magnetic waves rippling through our solar system. Space storms can have an impact on Earth when they reach our atmosphere, occasionally affecting satellites, radio communications and even power grids, according to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.India’s Aditya-L1 will add to information gathered on other missions designed to study the sun, including NASA’s ongoing Parker Solar Probe that in 2021 became the first spacecraft to “touch” the sun.",Chandrayaan-3,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/06/asia/india-aditya-l1-reaches-intended-orbit-intl/index.html,CNN,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""source"", ""reason"": ""The article cites the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration as a credible source to explain space weather, but does not provide any counter-sources or alternative perspectives."", ""confidence"": 0.8}",no,none,no bias
141,Module that powered historic moon mission has returned to Earth’s orbit,"The propulsion module that powered India’s spacecraft to a historic moon landing just transitioned back into Earth’s orbit, according to the country’s space agency. The move aims to test how the growing space power might one day return samples of lunar soil.The propulsion module had more fuel left over than the Indian Space Research Organization, or ISRO, had expected. So, researchers decided to move forward with an attempt to bring the module back toward home, the agency said Monday.And the module is now back in Earth’s orbit.The propulsion module — a unit shaped like a large box with a solar panel and an engine strapped to its bottom — propelled the Chandrayaan-3 mission’s lunar lander during most of its trek to the moon after the spacecraft launched in mid-July.After reaching lunar orbit three weeks later, the lander separated from the propulsion module and achieved touchdown on August 23 — making India only the fourth country to land a vehicle on the moon’s surface. Only the United States, China and the former Soviet Union had previously accomplished such a feat.The Vikram lander — and Pragyan, a six-wheeled rover it deployed — spent nearly two weeks carrying out all the mission’s planned science experiments before they were put to sleep for the lunar night, a two-week period when sunlight doesn’t reach the moon’s surface.Both the lander and the rover have remained in slumber on the moon after prior attempts to awaken the vehicles failed. If the vehicles had reawakened, it would have been an added bonus for the mission, which was deemed wholly successful by India’s space agency.Meanwhile, the propulsion module remained in lunar orbit. The component served as a relay point, pinging data back from the lander to Earth. And the module carried a single experiment: the Spectro-polarimetry of HAbitable Planet Earth, or SHAPE.The SHAPE experiment was designed to observe Earth from lunar orbit, capturing in near-infrared light the characteristics of our home planet that make it habitable for humans. The study was meant to give scientists a blueprint for how to search for similar characteristics — called “biosignatures” — elsewhere in the universe.The initial plan was to operate the SHAPE experiment for about three months, while the propulsion module continued whirring through lunar orbit.But because the rocket that launched the Chandrayaan-3 spacecraft delivered it to such a precise orbit, the propulsion module was left with more propellant than expected.It “resulted in the availability of over 100 kg (220 pounds) of fuel in the (propulsion module, or PM) after over one month of operations in the lunar orbit,” according to the space agency. “It was decided to use the available fuel in the PM to derive additional information for future lunar missions and demonstrate the mission operation strategies for a sample return mission.”That means the ISRO could use the information gleaned from the propulsion module’s return to map out a future moon landing mission that could return samples of lunar soil back to Earth.Similarly, India had previously tested a way to vault the Chandrayaan-3 lander back away from the surface of the moon after landing. It amounted to a short “hop” test, sending the vehicle up a few centimeters off the ground. (The trial did not, however, attempt to get back into lunar orbit or reconnect with the propulsion module. The maneuvers were only intended to test out aspects of the vehicle’s design to inform future missions.)The propulsion module is now orbiting about 96,000 miles (154,000 kilometers) above Earth, where it will make one lap of the planet about every 13 days.In its statement, the space agency said the propulsion module’s path back toward Earth was mapped out to consider “collision avoidance such as preventing the PM from crashing on to the Moon’s surface or entering into the Earth’s GEO belt at 36000 km and orbits below that.”GEO, or geostationary orbit, is an area of space populated by large, expensive satellites that provide television and other communications services to people on Earth.",Chandrayaan-3,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/05/world/chandrayaan-3-lunar-lander-propulsion-module-scn/index.html,CNN,"{""bias_detected"": ""no"", ""bias_type"": null, ""reason"": ""Article presents a neutral and factual account of the Chandrayaan-3 mission's propulsion module returning to Earth's orbit, without promoting or criticizing any particular viewpoint."", ""confidence"": 1.0}",no,none,no bias
142,Here’s what India’s historic lunar lander found on the moon — and what’s next,"After completing a historic landing on the lunar surface, putting India in the tiny club of countries that have safely placed a spacecraft on the moon, the Chandrayaan-3 lander is now asleep — resting through the 14-day lunar night before mission controllers attempt to reawaken the spacecraft later this month.The primary goals of the mission have now been successfully checked off the list, cementing the Chandrayaan-3 lander’s legacy in exploration history. For nearly two weeks, the lander carried out technology demonstrations and data collection mainly focused on analyzing the composition of the moon’s soil and super-thin atmosphere.The Chandrayaan-3 spacecraft landed on the lunar surface on August 23. The safe touchdown made India only the fourth nation in the world to complete such a feat, following the former Soviet Union, the United States and China. So far in the 21st Century, only China and India have landed on the moon.It also marked the first mission to explore so close to the lunar south pole, a region of key scientific and strategic importance for global space powers because it is believed to be home to deposits of water ice. The resource could be harvested and converted into drinking water or even rocket fuel for future missions that explore deeper into the cosmos.In India, the Chandryaan-3 mission has been hailed as a point of national pride. More than 70 million people watched online coverage of the landing, and thousands more packed into auditoriums and viewing parties across the country.“Our tireless scientific efforts will continue in order to develop better understanding of the Universe for the welfare of entire humanity,” Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi posted on social media September 2, celebrating the Chandrayaan-3 mission and the recent launch of India’s first spacecraft dedicated to studying the sun.The Indian Space Research Organization, or ISRO, confirmed on Monday, September 4, that the Chandryaan-3 lunar lander had been put into sleep mode, as the spacecraft isn’t designed to continue collecting scientific data while its landing spot is in the Earth’s shadow, or lunar night.But the space agency hopes that the lander — and a small six-wheeled rover it deployed — will be reawakened later this month, on September 22.The Chandrayaan-3 landing in August came mere days after Russia failed in its attempt to put a similar spacecraft, Luna-25, near the moon’s south pole. Standing in sharp contrast to the tense failures of Luna-25, the Chandryaan-3 vehicle almost immediately began dispatching updates on its successes.The day after landing, the ISRO confirmed that the Chandryaan-3 lander had successfully deployed the six-wheeled lunar rover that had ridden to the surface tucked inside the spacecraft’s body.It was released by rolling down a small ramp before setting off “in pursuit of lunar secrets at the South Pole,” the ISRO said on X, the website formerly known as Twitter.Together, the lander, which weighs about 1,700 kilograms (3,748 pounds), and the 26-kilogram (57.3-pound) rover are packed with nearly a dozen scientific instruments. They include a laser that can analyze the chemical composition of the moon’s regolith — aiding in the hunt for water ice — and the ultra-thin layer of gases that make up the moon’s exosphere. The rover is also equipped with a seismometer that attempted to detect quakes within the moon’s interior.The ISRO confirmed that all the instruments were “performing normally” during the mission.The space agency shared sporadic updates on social media, posting first glimpses at various data points gathered by the lander and rover, which managed to travel a total of more than 100 meters (330 feet) across the lunar surface and was able to snap photos of the lander during its trek.One experiment measured the temperature of the moon’s topsoil at various depths, and ISRO scientist BHM Darukesha told a local news outlet, PTI, that the surface was hotter than expected.“We all believed that the temperature could be somewhere around 20 degree centigrade to 30 degrees centigrade (68 to 86 degrees Fahrenheit) on the surface but it is 70 degree centigrade (158 degrees Fahrenheit). This is surprisingly higher than what we had expected,” he said.The rover also detected some seismic activity using an instrument designed to measure rumbles and quakes beneath the lunar surface, and the rover used a spectroscope to confirm the presence of sulfur near the moon’s south pole. Now scientists will aim to investigate how the element got there and whether it exists naturally on the surface or was put there by a meteor strike or volcanic activity, according to the ISRO.The ISRO put the rover to rest on September 2, though its solar panels were oriented to catch the first sun rays as the moon travels back into daytime later this month.“Hoping for a successful awakening for another set of assignments! Else, it will forever stay there as India’s lunar ambassador,” the ISRO posted on X.But the lander wasn’t finished. It completed another stunning feat on September 4, firing up its engines to lift itself about 40 centimeters (16 inches) off the ground and make a small hop to land about 30 to 40 centimeters (12 to 16 inches) away from its original position.The ISRO emphasized the importance of this technology demonstration, noting that being able to get a lander back off the lunar surface will be essential for future missions that aim to return soil samples — or even astronauts — back home after a lunar mission.Shortly after, the lander joined the rover, entering its own slumber and awaiting its reawakening when the sunshine returns to its resting place.It’s not yet certain that the lander and rover will, in fact, properly function when mission controllers attempt to turn them back on later this month.But all of the primary objectives the ISRO set out for the mission have been met.",Chandrayaan-3,https://www.cnn.com/2023/09/07/world/india-lunar-lander-chandryaan-mission-obit-scn/index.html,CNN,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""labeling"", ""reason"": ""Loaded language used to describe India's achievement as 'historic', 'tiny club of countries', and 'point of national pride' without similar descriptions for other nations."", ""confidence"": 0.8}",no,none,"no labelling bias, positive tone"
143,India launches first mission following its historic moon landing,"India launched its first spacecraft dedicated to studying the sun, building on a month of historic successes for the country’s civil space efforts.The spacecraft, called Aditya-L1, launched from Sriharikota, an island off the Bay of Bengal, at 11:50 a.m. Saturday local time (2:20 am ET). And it’s headed to a parking spot in orbit about 930,000 miles (1.5 million kilometers) from Earth.The successful liftoff of Aditya-L1 comes less than two weeks after India’s space agency, the Indian Space Research Organization, made history by landing its Chandrayaan-3 spacecraft on the lunar surface. The achievement made India only the fourth nation in the world — and the second in the 21st century — to land a vehicle safely on the moon.That mission is expected to conclude next week.Meanwhile, Aditya-L1 is heading for its destination at Lagrange point 1, an area that lies between the sun and Earth where the gravitational pull of both celestial objects cancel each other out. That location will allow Aditya-L1 to remain in orbit, in a position optimal for observing the sun’s activities, with minor fuel consumption.This position “will provide a greater advantage of observing the solar activities and its effect on space weather in real time,” according to the space agency.The spacecraft is equipped with seven scientific instruments, four of which will be trained directly on the sun while the others will study solar wind particles and magnetic fields passing through at Lagrange point 1.The main goals of the mission include studying the sun’s upper atmosphere and various solar phenomenon, such as coronal mass ejections — or massive expulsions of plasma from the sun’s outermost layer.The information gleaned from Aditya-L1’s experiments will provide a clearer picture of space weather, or the term used to describe the magnetic waves rippling through our solar system.

144,India rolls out its first rover on the lunar surface after historic landing,"We live in a time where new missions of exploration set off to the cosmos on a regular basis.But just because rocket launches have become more common doesn’t make it any less exciting to see a spacecraft lift off to the heavens.On Saturday, NASA launched its most internationally diverse crew yet. The SpaceX Crew Dragon Endurance capsule carried four astronauts from the United States, Russia, Japan and Denmark to the International Space Station, where they will live and work about 227 nautical miles above Earth for 190 days.The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency is expected this weekend to launch a high-precision lunar lander dubbed the “Moon Sniper,” as well as XRISM, or the X-Ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission, to study some of the most extreme celestial objects.And earlier this week, one country made history with a moon shot that captured the attention of the world.India successfully landed its uncrewed Chandrayaan-3 spacecraft on the moon Wednesday. The historic occasion marked the country as a global space power and only the fourth nation to achieve a lunar landing.The robotic explorer touched down closer to the lunar south pole than any other previous mission has ventured, and it’s a region many space agencies are eager to explore due to its potential resources.Chandrayaan-3 has already returned several images and rolled out its Pragyan rover on the lunar surface.Meanwhile, Russia’s Luna 25 lander crashed into the moon, causing experts to question the country’s future lunar ambitions.Portraits often depict Bonnie Prince Charlie, who led the unsuccessful Jacobite rebellion in the 1700s, as a heroic and dashing figure.But a new recreation based on a death mask, or a cast taken of his face after he died, reveals a more down-to-earth side of the 18th century British royal.Researchers used the mask, along with 3D models, to show him as a young man of 24 with curly hair, wide eyes and a bit of acne.“I wanted to portray him as a normal, regular person because he was 24 years old and he was a person who had hobbies and liked to do different things,” said Barbora Veselá, a graduate student in forensic art and facial imaging at the University of Dundee in the United Kingdom.Humans handle a lot of messy, tedious tasks that can be considered hazardous, both on Earth and in space.But a new humanoid robot design called Apollo, unveiled this week by robotics startup Apptronik, could one day do household chores and even help build habitats on the moon and Mars.About the size of the average human, Apollo is capable of walking, picking up objects and placing them. Initially designed to improve logistics in warehouse settings, the robot could play a role one day in NASA’s Artemis program, according to the Apptronik team.We visited Apptronik in Austin, Texas, to see Apollo in action and learn how it could further cosmic exploration.Astronomers have spied a large dark spot in Neptune’s atmosphere that represents a massive swirling storm.It’s the first time one of these vortex-like spots has been detected using an Earth-based telescope.There’s an air of mystery around the storms and why they form on Neptune. The new images also revealed a bright spot next to the storm that may be a first-of-its-kind feature on the blue ice giant.Additionally, an international team of scientists think they know why Neptune’s ghostly ice clouds have largely disappeared, and it has something to do with the sun’s increasing activity.As the world warms due to the climate crisis, Antarctica’s iconic emperor penguins may begin to disappear.Emperor penguins rely on the steady presence of sea ice for nesting and raising their chicks. When the ice breaks and melts earlier than expected, the chicks can drown, drift away or starve.New research showed that multiple colonies of the marine birds saw none of their chicks survive in 2022 as global warming caused vital sea ice to vanish.Meanwhile, increasing temperatures are making it difficult for some trees in tropical forests to photosynthesize. Beyond a certain threshold, warming could cause widespread loss of carbon-storing trees and affect the global climate in the future.Check out these riveting reads:— A rare baby giraffe was born without its signature spots at a zoo in Tennessee, and the calf might be the only patchless giraffe currently living on the planet.— The Solar Orbiter captured cutting-edge images of tiny jets of material escaping into space from the sun’s south pole.— Researchers explored a thriving octopus garden in the ocean’s midnight zone off Monterey, California, and they now believe they know why the cephalopods cluster there in the thousands.",Chandrayaan-3,https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/26/world/india-moon-landing-science-newsletter-wt-scn/index.html,CNN,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""selection"", ""reason"": ""The article focuses on various space-related events and missions from around the world, but only briefly mentions India's Chandrayaan-3 mission in a single paragraph.

145,See stunning footage captured by India’s Chandrayaan-3 lunar lander,"The history-making Chandrayaan-3 mission, which landed on the lunar surface two days ago, has deployed its small, six-wheeled rover on an exploratory expedition to better understand the composition of the moon’s soil.The Indian Space Research Organization, or ISRO, said in a social media post that the rover, which rode to the lunar surface tucked inside the lander, successfully exited the spacecraft on Thursday by rolling down a small ramp.The agency also released a short video clip from the lander, called Vikram, showing the ramp deploying and the rover making its careful exit.The space agency also said Friday that the rover, named Pragyan or “wisdom” in Sanskrit, traveled 8 meters (26 feet), and both of its scientific instruments were functioning.The Pragyan rover is equipped with two key features: the Alpha Particle X-ray Spectrometer and the Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy, both of which are capable of determining the chemical elements present in soil and rocks on the lunar surface.The Chandrayaan-3 mission touched down on the moon Wednesday, making India the fourth country to complete a successful soft landing on the lunar surface. The vehicle also landed closer to the moon’s south pole than any other spacecraft has ventured.The south pole region is considered an area of key scientific and strategic interest for spacefaring nations as scientists believe it home to water ice deposits. The water, frozen in shadowy craters, could be converted into rocket fuel or even drinking water for future crewed missions.The Indian space agency also said Friday that the lunar lander, the rover and the propulsion module — which was used to boost the lander from Earth’s orbit out to the moon and remains in orbit around the moon — are all functioning as planned.The agency on Thursday shared footage captured by the lander in the final moments before touchdown, showing a piece of the spacecraft body as it whisked by the dusty gray lunar terrain.The lander and rover are expected to function for about two weeks on the moon’s surface.Before Chandrayaan-3, only the United States, the former Soviet Union and China had safely landed spacecraft on the moon. The success of Chandrayaan, which means “moon vehicle” in Sanskrit and Hindi, helps cement India’s status as a global space superpower.Its successful touchdown also came just days after Russia, attempting its first lunar landing since the Soviet era, crash-landed on the moon’s surface after its Luna 25 vehicle misfired.",Chandrayaan-3,https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/25/world/india-chandrayaan-3-lander-rover-images-scn/index.html,CNN,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""labeling"", ""reason"": ""Loaded label 'global space superpower' applied to India without parity across actors."", ""confidence"": 0.8}",no,none,no labelling bias
146,‘India is on the moon’: Pride and joy as lunar landing burnishes country’s image,"Indians around the world have united with pride and excitement after the South Asian nation on Wednesday became the first country to soft land a spacecraft on the moon’s unexplored South Pole, and only the fourth country to reach the lunar surface.A lander named Vikram and a rover called Pragyan, robots from India’s Chandrayaan-3 mission, touched down on the moon just after 6 p.m. local time – a moment watched by 70 million people on the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO)’s YouTube page.“We have achieved soft landing on the moon,” said ISRO chairman S. Somanath to thunderous applause in the control room. “India is on the moon.”The history-making event has become an immense source of pride for the country of 1.4 billion as it takes challenging steps to become a space pioneer and cement its status as a global power.Chandrayaan-3’s success has brought together a nation struggling at a time of deep communal strife, with deadly sectarian violence flaring in pockets of the country. It presents a moment of hope and unity to millions who are reveling in ISRO’s achievement.Worshipers were seen praying at Hindu temples, mosques and Sikh gurdwaras ahead of its landing. Several schools around the country organized live viewings of the mission and children fervently waved the Indian flag when Chandrayaan-3 touched down on the moon’s surface.Locals burst fire crackers, distributed sweets in the streets and danced enthusiastically to celebrate the achievement. Chants of “victory to India!” thundered outside the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research in capital New Delhi.“I’m very excited,” said Ashish Kumar Verma, who was watching the live stream. “It was a very great moment to witness.”Another viewer, Charvi Katare, said the moment was “inspirational” for India.Further south in Mumbai, the city’s beloved police band played a rendition of the popular Indian patriotic song, “We Shall Overcome” in honor of the event.A host of celebrities, politicians and global icons also lauded India’s effort.“Congratulations to all the scientists and engineers… the whole team which has made India so proud,” Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter.Cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar said: “Humble, hardworking women and men, coming together, overcoming challenges, and making our tricolor fly high.”“India has become a true pioneer in space exploration,” wrote Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Union commission.In a further successful step on Thursday morning, the rover Pragyan exited the Chandrayaan-3 and took its first steps on the moon.“The Ch-3 rover ramped down from the lander,” ISRO wrote on X. “India took a walk on the moon!”India has in recent years made huge strides in its space ambitions.For Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who swept to power in 2014 on a promise of future greatness and nationalism, Chandrayaan-3’s success is particularly exciting. It comes days after Russia’s Luna 25 spacecraft failed to land on the moon, crashing on its surface instead and bringing an end to Moscow’s first lunar landing attempt in 47 years.For a nation that only gained independence from the British 76 years ago, and one where large pockets of the population remain impoverished, India’s triumph over Russia – a country seen as a space pioneer – is symbolic of the changing world order.When India launched its first rocket into space in 1963, the country was no match for the ambitions of the United States and the former Soviet Union, which were way ahead in the space race.Workers from its space agency transported spaceship parts to the rocket launchpad using bicycles. Now, it can say it has orbited the moon and Mars, even breaking records and launching hundreds of satellites at a far lower cost than other space-faring countries.It’s rise in the space game is also indicative of its growth on the global stage.India and China have been locked in a tense standoff at their contested, shared border, pushing New Delhi closer to Washington and its allies to counter Beijing’s increasing assertiveness. Russia has grown increasingly isolated since its unprovoked invasion of Ukraine.New Delhi, whose ties with the Kremlin date back decades, has deftly balanced its relations with both Moscow and Washington since the war, and has emerged as a leading power in the Indo-Pacific, with Modi appearing as a leader who cemented India as an international power broker.Modi, who faces an election battle next year, was in South Africa attending the BRICS economic group summit when the news came through. He watched Chandrayaan-3 make its mark on the moon, waving an Indian flag and smiling as the spacecraft touched down.“This moment is of developed India’s victory,” he said shortly after. “This moment is of new India’s victory cry.”India’s Foreign Minister S. Jaishankar, who is also in Johannesburg, was seen talking to his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov as Chandrayaan-3 reached the lunar surface.“Is it landing or mooning?” Lavrov asked jokingly.“You can say it’s over the moon. He’s over the moon,” Jaishankar was heard replying.“I salute you. Really, really impressive,” Lavrov said back.Chandrayaan-3’s success prompted ISRO chief Somnath to comment on India’s separate plans for a mission to the sun.“We are planning to have a launch in the first week of September,” he said.India is also preparing for a human space flight. While no official date has been announced, preparations are likely to be ready by next year.As Chandrayaan-3 approached the moon, its cameras captured photographs, including one taken on August 20 that India’s space agency shared Tuesday. The image offers a close-up of the moon’s dusty, pock-marked terrain.India’s lunar lander consists of three parts: a lander, rover and propulsion module, which provided the spacecraft all the thrust required to traverse the 384,400-kilometer (238,855-mile) void between the moon and Earth.The lander, called Vikram, completed the precision maneuvers required to make a soft touchdown on the lunar surface after it was ejected from the propulsion module. Tucked inside was Pragyan, a small, six-wheeled rover that trundled down a ramp onto the moon’s surface.Vikram used its on board thrusters to carefully orient itself as it approached the lunar surface, and it slowly throttled down its engines for a touchdown just after 6 p.m. IST (8:30 a.m. ET) as applause erupted from the mission control room.ISRO later confirmed it had established two-way communication with the spacecraft and shared the first images of the surface captured during the lander’s final descent.The lander, which weighs about 1,700 kilograms (3,748 pounds), and the 26-kilogram (57.3-pound) rover are packed with scientific instruments, prepared to capture data to help researchers analyze the lunar surface and deliver fresh insights into its composition.Moreover, the south pole region is considered an area of key scientific and strategic interest for space-faring nations, as scientists believe the region to be home to water ice deposits.The water, frozen in shadowy craters, could be converted into rocket fuel or even drinking water for future crewed missions.“The moon offers great scientific reward, which is why we’ve seen so many recent attempts to visit the surface again,” NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said in a statement on Sunday. “We’re looking forward to all that we will learn in the future, including from India’s Chandraayan-3 mission.”",Chandrayaan-3,https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/24/india/chandrayaan-3-india-landing-thursday-intl-hnk-scn/index.html,CNN,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""framing"", ""reason"": ""The article frames India's achievement as a moment of national pride and unity, emphasizing the country's growth and rise as a global power.

147,India becomes the fourth country ever to land a spacecraft on the moon,"India has landed its Chandrayaan-3 spacecraft on the moon, becoming only the fourth nation ever to accomplish such a feat.The mission could cement India’s status as a global superpower in space. Previously, only the United States, China and the former Soviet Union have completed soft landings on the lunar surface.Chandrayaan-3’s landing site is also closer to the moon’s south pole than any other spacecraft in history has ventured. The south pole region is considered an area of key scientific and strategic interest for spacefaring nations, as scientists believe the region to be home to water ice deposits.The water, frozen in shadowy craters, could be converted into rocket fuel or even drinking water for future crewed missions.Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, currently in South Africa for the BRICS Summit, watched the landing virtually and shared broadcasted remarks on the livestream.“On this joyous occasion…I would like to address all the people of the world,” he said. “India’s successful moon mission is not just India’s alone. This is a year in which the world is witnessing India’s G20 presidency. Our approach of one Earth, one family, one future is resonating across the globe.“This human-centric approach that we present and we represent has been welcome universally. Our moon mission is also based on the same human-centric approach,” Modi added. “Therefore, this success belongs to all of humanity, and it will help moon missions by other countries in the future.”India’s attempt to land its spacecraft near the lunar south pole comes just days after another nation’s failed attempt to do the same. Russia’s Luna 25 spacecraft crashed into the moon on August 19 after its engines misfired, ending the country’s first lunar landing attempt in 47 years.As Chandrayaan-3 approached the moon, its cameras captured photographs, including one taken on August 20 that India’s space agency shared Tuesday. The image offers a close-up of the moon’s dusty gray terrain.India’s lunar lander consists of three parts: a lander, rover and propulsion module, which provided the spacecraft all the thrust required to traverse the 384,400-kilometer (238,855-mile) void between the moon and Earth.The lander, called Vikram, completed the precision maneuvers required to make a soft touchdown on the lunar surface after it was ejected from the propulsion module. Tucked inside is Pragyan, a small, six-wheeled rover that will deploy from the lander by rolling down a ramp.Vikram used its on board thrusters to carefully orient itself as it approached the lunar surface, and it slowly throttled down its engines for a touchdown just after 6 p.m. IST (8:30 a.m. ET) as applause erupted from the mission control room.The Indian Space Research Organization, or ISRO, later confirmed it had established two-way communication with the spacecraft and shared the first images of the surface captured during the lander’s final descent.The lander, which weighs about 1,700 kilograms (3,748 pounds), and 26-kilogram (57.3-pound) rover are packed with scientific instruments, prepared to capture data to help researchers analyze the lunar surface and deliver fresh insights into its composition.Dr. Angela Marusiak, an assistant research professor at the University of Arizona’s Lunar and Planetary Laboratory, said she’s particularly excited that the lunar lander includes a seismometer that will attempt to detect quakes within the moon’s interior.Studying how the moon’s inner layers move could be key information for future endeavors on the lunar surface, Marusiak said.“You want to make sure that any potential seismic activity wouldn’t endanger any astronauts,” Marusiak said. “Or, if we were to build structures on the moon, that they would be safe from any seismic activity.”The lander and rover are expected to function for about two weeks on the moon’s surface. The propulsion module will remain in orbit, serving as a relay point for beaming data back to Earth.Working alongside allies such as the United States and France, India is part of a second wave of emerging space powers. The country’s space program has become one of the world’s busiest in its development of exploratory space technology.Chandrayaan-3 has been a point of national pride and widespread interest across India. Crowds gathered at the launchpad at Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota in Andhra Pradesh state to watch the mission take flight in July. On Wednesday, more than 8 million people tuned in to view a livestream of the landing.At least 500 people gathered at India’s Council of Scientific and Industrial Research in New Delhi Wednesday where the livestream was broadcast in an auditorium as well as outdoors at a temporary pavilion. After a successful touchdown was confirmed, Indian sweets were distributed to the audience, firecrackers were lit and spectators applauded for more than a minute.Chants of “Bharat Mata Ki Jai” — or “victory to India” — could be heard, and children joyously waved the Indian flag.India’s mission has taken on even greater significance since Russia’s failed Luna 25 landing attempt. With the success of Chandrayaan-3, India became the second country to land a spacecraft on the moon in the 21st century after China, which has put three landers on the lunar surface since 2013 — including the first to touch down on the moon’s far side. (The last US lunar lander, the crewed Apollo 17 mission, touched down in 1972.)More than a dozen countries have plans for missions to the moon in the coming years, including a mission launched by Japan’s space agency — the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency — that is expected to lift off later this month. The United States also has plans to send three commercial lunar landers to the moon starting as early as this year, while NASA continues to work toward its Artemis III mission, which could put astronauts back on the moon as soon as 2025.Landing on the moon, however, remains a challenging endeavor. India’s last attempt to land a spacecraft on the moon, during the 2019 Chandrayaan-2 mission, failed. And two commercial spacecraft have crash-landed on the lunar surface in recent times — one from Israel in 2019 and the other from Japan in April.“There is no doubt that landing on the Moon is a real challenge,” NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said in a statement on Sunday. “But the Moon offers great scientific reward, which is why we’ve seen so many recent attempts to visit the surface again. We’re looking forward to all that we will learn in the future, including from India’s Chandraayan-3 mission.”On Wednesday, Nelson also shared a congratulatory note on social media, saying, “congratulations to #India on being the 4th country to successfully soft-land a spacecraft on the Moon. We’re glad to be your partner on this mission!”India is also a signatory of the United States’ Artemis Accords, a document that outlines proposed rules of the road for future lunar exploration.

148,See striking moon photos captured by India’s lunar lander during its approach,"India’s Chandrayaan-3 spacecraft is swooping toward the moon’s surface ahead of its historic landing attempt, and it’s capturing some stunning visuals on the way.The Indian Space Research Organization confirmed Tuesday that Chandrayaan-3 is on schedule and “smooth sailing is continuing.” The spacecraft is set to begin its final descent toward the moon’s surface on Wednesday at 5:45 p.m. IST (8:15 a.m. ET).If successful, this mission will mark the very first soft landing on the lunar surface by an Indian spacecraft and make India the fourth country ever to accomplish such a feat. Currently, the United States, China and the former Soviet Union are the only nations that have conducted controlled landings of spacecraft on the moon.India’s space agency will livestream the landing attempt starting at 5:20 p.m. IST (7:50 a.m. ET) on Wednesday.The ISRO on Tuesday marked the eve of Chandrayaan-3’s landing by sharing photos and footage captured with cameras on the spacecraft.One bird’s-eye view of the moon was taken from 70 kilometers (43.5 miles) above the lunar surface, depicting such features as the Mare Marginis, a large black spot formed by ancient asteroid strikes on the extreme edge of the near side of the moon.Another image, taken on August 20 from a much closer vantage point as the spacecraft whisked by, offered a close-up of the moon’s dusty gray terrain.The spacecraft is able to orient its positioning by matching the images captured by its cameras to a lunar map programmed into its onboard computer, according to the space agency.Chandrayaan, which means “moon vehicle” in Sanskrit, launched from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre at Sriharikota in India’s southern Andhra Pradesh state on July 14. The spacecraft has been making a slow, methodical approach toward the lunar surface.The mission marks India’s second attempt to complete a soft landing on the moon.

149,India’s Chandrayaan-3 enters lunar orbit in step closer to moon rover soft landing,"India moved one step closer to executing a controlled landing on the moon after its Chandrayaan-3 spacecraft entered lunar orbit over the weekend, inching toward the surface’s unexplored South Pole.The Indian Space Research Organization confirmed the spacecraft also “successfully underwent a planned orbit reduction maneuver,” in an update Sunday on X, formerly known as Twitter. “The retrofiring of engines brought it closer to the Moon’s surface.”The craft is expected to land on the moon on August 23. If successful, it would make India only the fourth country to achieve the complicated feat, behind the United States, the former Soviet Union and China.Developed by the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO), Chandrayaan-3 is comprised of a lander, propulsion module and rover. Its aim is to safely land near the challenging terrain of the moon’s South Pole, collect data and conduct a series of scientific experiments to learn more about the moon’s composition.It blasted off from the Satish Dhawan Space Center at Sriharikota in southern Andhra Pradesh state on July 14, elevating India’s space ambitions and cementing its status as a growing hub of innovation and technology.It’s India’s second attempt at a soft landing, after its previous effort failed with the Chandrayaan-2 in 2019. Its first lunar probe, the Chandrayaan-1, orbited the moon and was then deliberately crash-landed onto the lunar surface in 2008.Indian engineers have been working on the project for years.India’s maiden lunar mission, Chandrayaan-1, discovered water molecules on the moon’s surface. Eleven years later, the Chandrayaan-2 successfully entered lunar orbit but its rover crash-landed on the moon’s surface.

150,India launches historic Chandrayaan-3 mission to land spacecraft on the moon,"India is bidding to become only the fourth country to execute a controlled landing on the moon with the successful launch Friday of its Chandrayaan-3 mission.Chandrayaan, which means “moon vehicle” in Sanskrit, blasted off from the Satish Dhawan Space Center at Sriharikota in southern Andhra Pradesh state at just after 2:30 p.m. local time (5 a.m. ET).Crowds gathered at the space center to watch the history-making launch and more than 1 million people tuned in to watch on YouTube.The Indian Space Research Organization confirmed on Twitter later Friday that Chandrayaan-3 is in “precise orbit” and has “begun its journey to the moon.”It added that the health of the spacecraft is “normal.”In response, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted: “Chandrayaan-3 scripts a new chapter in India’s space odyssey. It soars high, elevating the dreams and ambitions of a every Indian. This momentous achievement is a testament to our scientists’ relentless dedication.

Eleven years later, the Chandrayaan-2 successfully entered lunar orbit but its rover crash-landed on the moon’s surface. It too was supposed to explore the moon’s South Pole.At the time, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi hailed the engineers behind the mission despite the failure, promising to keep working on India’s space program and ambitions.Just before Friday’s launch, Modi said the day “will always be etched in golden letters as far as India’s space sector is concerned.”“This remarkable mission will carry the hopes and dreams of our nation,” he said in a Twitter post.India has since spent about $75 million on its Chandrayaan-3 mission.Modi said the rocket will cover more than 300,000 kilometers (186,411 miles) and reach the moon in the “coming weeks.”India’s space program dates back more than six decades, to when it was a newly independent republic and a deeply poor country reeling from a bloody partition.When it launched its first rocket into space in 1963, the country was no match for the ambitions of the US and the former Soviet Union, which were way ahead in the space race.Now, India is the world’s most populous nation and its fifth largest economy. It boasts a burgeoning young population and is home to a growing hub of innovation and technology.And India’s space ambitions have been playing catch up under Modi.For the leader, who swept to power in 2014 on a ticket of nationalism and future greatness, India’s space program is a symbol of the country’s rising prominence on the global stage.In 2014, India became the first Asian nation to reach Mars, when it put the Mangalyaan probe into orbit around the Red Planet, for $74 million – less than the $100 million Hollywood spent making space thriller “Gravity.”Three years later, India launched a record 104 satellites in one mission.In 2019, Modi announced in a rare televised address that India had shot down one of its own satellites, in what it claimed was an anti-satellite test, making it one of only four countries to do so.That same year ISRO’s former chairman Kailasavadivoo Sivan said India was planning to set up an independent space station by 2030. Currently, the only space stations available for expedition crews are the International Space Station (a joint project between several countries) and China’s Tiangong Space Station.The rapid development and innovation has made space tech one of India’s hottest sectors for investors – and world leaders appear to have taken notice.Last month, when Modi met US President Joe Biden in Washington on a state visit, the White House said both leaders sought more collaboration in the space economy.And India’s space ambitions do not stop at the moon or Mars.

151,Indian military chief acknowledges loss of fighter jets in May conflict with Pakistan,"India’s military has acknowledged for the first time that an unspecified number of its fighter jets were shot down during strikes on Pakistani-controlled territory amid intense fighting between the neighbors in early May.Indian officials had previously refused to confirm even a single aircraft loss.Asked by a Bloomberg correspondent on Saturday if Pakistan was correct in its claim that “six Indian jets” were downed, Anil Chauhan, the chief of defense staff of the Indian Armed Forces, initially denied the veracity of the claim, stating: “Absolutely incorrect and that is not information which, as I said, is important.”But he went on to say that “what is important is why they went down,” seeming to imply that a number of jets were shot down during fighting between the historic foes, although not confirming how many. “That is more important for us. And what did we do after that? That’s more important,” he said, speaking to Bloomberg’s Haslinda Amin while attending the Shangri-La Dialogue, Asia’s premier defense forum, in Singapore.The official also accepted that India’s military had made a “tactical mistake,” in response to another question about Pakistan’s claim.“The good part is we were able to understand the tactical mistake which we made, remedy it, rectify it and then implement it again after two days and flew all our jets, again targeting at long range,” he said.Pakistan claimed its pilots shot down five Indian fighter jets in aerial battles – including three advanced French-made Rafales – after India launched its military operation against Pakistan in early May. Pakistan said it used Chinese-made fighter jets to shoot down the Indian combat aircraft, including the Rafales.India initially denied the claims, with Nalin Kohli, spokesperson for India’s Bharatiya Janata Party, telling CNN that “if that was the case, and if something of that extent had happened, we would have said so.”A high-ranking French intelligence official told CNN at the time that one Rafale fighter jet operated by the Indian Air Force had been downed by Pakistan, and that French authorities were looking into whether more than one was brought down. Indian eyewitnesses also told CNN they saw one aircraft plunging from the sky in flames.The fighting was a major escalation between the South Asian neighbors and came in response to the killing of tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir in April. India blamed Pakistan for the attack, an accusation rejected by Islamabad. A truce between Islamabad and New Delhi was announced on May 10.CNN’s Benjamin Brown, Matthew Chance, Sophia Saifi and Saskya Vandoorne contributed to this report.",Operation Sindoor,https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/31/asia/india-pakistan-kashmir-conflict-jets-intl,CNN,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""source"", ""reason"": ""The article relies on multiple sources from CNN and Bloomberg, but does not provide a counter-source from an Indian government or military official.

152,"Divided by a border, united by fear: Kashmiris pick up the pieces after India-Pakistan step back from the brink","Mohammad Iqbal was working the nightshift at a power plant when he got a frantic call from his family saying artillery shells were exploding around their home.“I told them all to hunker down in one room together on the ground floor and hopefully things would become okay by morning,” he told CNN.But dawn brought no relief from the shelling that would continue for four days as India and Pakistan fought their most intense conflict in decades, raising fears of an all-out war.Iqbal, 47, lives near the town Poonch in India-administered Kashmir, a stone’s throw from the de-facto border with Pakistan, an area of pine-clad foothills and flowery meadows, backdropped by towering, icy peaks.But the idyll is illusory – Kashmir is one of the world’s most militarized regions and the trigger for multiple wars between India and Pakistan, who both claim the territory in full but control only in part.Last week the nuclear-armed neighbors traded missiles, drones, and artillery shelling for four days following a massacre of tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir last month that New Delhi blamed on its neighbor, which Pakistan denies.Two hours after the firing started last Wednesday, Iqbal got news his brother-in-law’s home had been hit.The shell had exploded at a nearby water tank, obliterating windows and sending shards of glass flying, hitting his brother-in-law and niece.What followed was a frantic scramble to get the wounded to the nearest hospital.“As people started evacuating there were a few people in the village with cars so people just poured into whatever vehicle they could find,” Iqbal said.“For a few hours it was difficult to locate everyone. People got split up. But finally at the hospital my family came together.”There, he found his brother-in-law, who works as a policeman, critically wounded and medical staff struggling to treat the influx of casualties.Iqbal’s brother-in-law survived. But two of his neighbors did not.Pakistan said on Tuesday that 40 civilians had been killed and 121 wounded in Indian firing, and that 11 members of its armed forces had been killed. India has previously said 15 civilians were killed and 59 wounded and that it had lost five soldiers.For the roughly 15 million people living in the contested region, the latest bout of hostilities has appeared to push a political solution for their home further away than ever.But the immediate concern in both sides of Kashmir is how long the skies will stay quiet.“There is an uneasy calm here,” Amir Choudhary, 25, from the town of Akhnoor in India-administered Kashmir told CNN on Sunday, hours after the ceasefire came into effect.“Markets are open again and some people who had left have slowly started coming back,” he said.“There still is that anxiety about what might happen when night comes,” he added.On the other side of the Line of Control, in Pakistan-administered Kashmir, Saima Ashraf shared those feelings.“Uncertainty still prevails,” she said.  “Many believe it (the ceasefire) is not a permanent solution.”Others are unclear about when they can return to their homes and villages.“Many of them are waiting to see how the situation develops before making a decision about returning,” Akhtar Ayoub, a local administration official in Pakistan’s Neelum Valley, told Reuters.Raja Shoukat Iqbal, who lives near the de facto border, described the ceasefire as “essential for the people of Kashmir” who he said were paying a high price on both sides of the divide.“This peace was also necessary on the international level because both countries are nuclear powers, any mistakes or anger of any country could cause the deaths of two billion people,” he posited.Kashmir has been a flashpoint since 1947, when British India was hastily divided into two by its former colonial rulers.What followed was the birth of two nations: Hindu-majority India and Muslim-majority Pakistan. Millions suddenly found themselves on the “wrong” side of the new border, leading to a frantic and bloody mass migration that tore communities asunder.Kashmir, a Muslim-majority state led by a Hindu monarch, was in a unique position. Pakistan laid claim to the territory, while the prince chose India.Both Pakistan and India, two nations gripped by fervent nationalism, believe that Muslim-majority Kashmir is an integral part of their countries.For Pakistan – which was founded as a homeland for South Asia’s Muslims – Kashmir’s division is viewed as a grave historic injustice.The country’s powerful military is run by the general Asim Munir, known for his hardline stance on India. Weeks before the latest conflict, he described Kashmir as Pakistan’s “jugular vein,” according to local media reports.India has long accused Pakistan of funding terror groups in Kashmir, an accusation denied by Islamabad. Pakistan, meanwhile, seeks to position the cause of violence in the region as a result of New Delhi’s alleged “oppression.”Hindu nationalist Prime Minister Narendra Modi has pushed a more uncompromising position on the contested land.In 2019, his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government split the former state into two union territories, giving the government in New Delhi greater control over the Muslim-majority region.India and Pakistan have both claimed victory from their latest conflict.New Delhi says its strikes inside Pakistani territory – the deepest since one of their wars in 1971 – have eradicated terror camps used to plot attacks on India – including the massacre of tourists last month that sparked the conflict.Pakistan says its air force shot down five Indian warplanes, including advanced French-made Rafale fighter jets.On Monday, in his first remarks since the fighting started, Modi said India had “only suspended our responsive attack on Pakistan’s terror and military hubs.”“In the coming days we will measure Pakistan’s every step,” he said.Those on both sides of the border have long been living under the threat of shelling and strikes.A student from Uri, in India-administered Kashmir, described to CNN lying awake as the sound of shelling shook his home last week.“We sat in silence, extremely petrified,” he said. “Praying the next target would not be our family or our home.”The student, who CNN is not naming for security reasons, described the jubilant moment he heard the news announcing the ceasefire.“Smiles plastered across our faces, and we hugged,” he said.“We now want this ceasefire to stay. Both countries need to find long-term solutions.”Iqbal, the power plant worker, said he was trying to remain optimistic despite the damage done.“We are lucky,” he said. “We have only homes to re-build and our family is together. I hope things don’t resume. But there’s no guarantee.”",Operation Sindoor,https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/14/asia/kashmir-india-pakistan-human-toll-intl-hnk-dst,CNN,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""framing"", ""reason"": ""The article frames the conflict as a humanitarian issue, emphasizing the suffering of civilians and the need for a peaceful solution.

153,India and Pakistan both claim victory. But this latest conflict has no winners,"Victory has a thousand fathers, as they say, but defeat is an orphan.And so it goes after the brief but bruising conflict between nuclear rivals India and Pakistan with both sides loudly talking up their successes while quietly down-playing losses.On India’s frantic television news channels, minutes after a US-brokered ceasefire came into force, the headline “Pakistan Surrenders” was splashed across the screens.India’s military action against Pakistan, sparked by the killing of tourists in India-administered Kashmir last month, sent a bold message to terrorists, India’s defense minister, Rajnath Singh, said later.Meanwhile, in Pakistan, crowds gathered in the streets of the capital to celebrate what Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif described as “military history” achieved by “our brave army in a spectacular fashion.”“In a few hours our jets silenced India’s guns in a way that history will not soon forget,” Sharif said, while an effigy of his Indian counterpart burned outside.But this was an eruption of violence between two nuclear-armed neighbors in which both sides delivered and suffered heavy blows.Pakistan has trumpeted successes in the skies, claiming its pilots shot down five Indian fighter jets in aerial battles – including three advanced French-made Rafales – in what would be a stinging humiliation for the Indian air force.As CNN earlier reported, two planes crashed in Indian states that border Pakistan around the time Pakistan claimed to have shot down the jets, and a French intelligence source told CNN that Pakistan had downed at least one Indian Rafale.But Indian officials are still refusing to acknowledge even a single aircraft loss.Meanwhile, India has released new satellite images showing serious damage to air strips and radar stations at what Indian defense officials say are multiple Pakistani military bases crippled by massive Indian airstrikes.In other words, political and military leaders in India and Pakistan can spin it how they like, but there is no clear winner in this conflict.There’s even a struggle to take credit for what were clearly US-brokered negotiations that led to the ceasefire, announced almost out of the blue by US President Donald Trump on his Truth Social platform.Amid a rapidly deteriorating security situation at the weekend, which threatened to spin out of control, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said he and Vice President JD Vance called political and military leaders on both sides urging them to hold back.Pakistani officials expressed gratitude for the intervention. But Indian leaders are playing down any US role, saying the truce was worked out between India and Pakistan directly.The reason is likely to be driven by national pride, with Indian officials loathe to admit a truce was imposed on them, or even brokered, by the United States.India also has a long-standing policy of refusing to allow foreign mediation when it comes to the status of Muslim-majority Kashmir - a disputed region claimed by both India and Pakistan in its entirety - which has been at the center of the latest conflict with Pakistan and which India regards as a strictly internal matter.Nevertheless, perhaps buoyed by his quick ceasefire win, President Trump has offered to help the two countries find a lasting solution “after a thousand years” concerning Kashmir. Inevitably, Pakistan has welcomed the idea, while in India it has fallen on deaf ears.The offer is a stark reminder, though, that the US-brokered truce is little more than a quick fix, a band aid that is unlikely to remotely address the fundamental grievances fueling what is actually a decades long dispute, over the status of Kashmir.And if you think the Indian and Pakistani claims of victory both ring a bit hollow now, just wait until the simmering Kashmir dispute, inevitably, boils over once again.",Operation Sindoor,https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/12/asia/india-pakistan-us-ceasefire-no-winners-intl-hnk,CNN,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""tonality"", ""reason"": ""The article's tone is neutral and balanced, but it uses phrases like 'India's frantic television news channels' and 'Indian officials are still refusing to acknowledge even a single aircraft loss', which have a slightly "", ""confidence"": 0.7}",yes,tonality,uses phrases like 'India's frantic television news channels' and 'Indian officials are still refusing to acknowledge even a single aircraft loss'
154,China has spent billions developing military tech. Conflict between India and Pakistan could be its first major test,"The escalating conflict between India and Pakistan could be offering the world a first real glimpse into how advanced Chinese military technology performs against proven Western hardware – and Chinese defense stocks are already surging.Shares of China’s AVIC Chengdu Aircraft rose 40% this week, as Pakistan claimed it used AVIC-produced J-10C fighter jets to shoot down Indian combat aircraft – including the advanced French-made Rafale – during an aerial battle on Wednesday.India has not responded to Pakistan’s claims or acknowledged any aircraft losses. When asked about the involvement of Chinese-made jets, a spokesperson for China’s Foreign Ministry said on Thursday he was not familiar with the situation.Still, as Pakistan’s primary arms supplier, China is likely watching intently to find out how its weapon systems have and potentially will perform in real combat.A rising military superpower, China hasn’t fought a major war in more than four decades. But under leader Xi Jinping, it has raced to modernize its armed forces, pouring resources into developing sophisticated weaponry and cutting-edge technologies.It has also extended that modernization drive to Pakistan, long hailed by Beijing as its “ironclad brother.”Over the past five years, China has supplied 81% of Pakistan’s imported weapons, according to data from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI).Those exports include advanced fighter jets, missiles, radars and air-defense systems that experts say would play a pivotal role in any military conflict between Pakistan and India. Some Pakistan-made weapons have also been co-developed with Chinese firms or built with Chinese technology and expertise.“This makes any engagement between India and Pakistan a de facto test environment for Chinese military exports,” said Sajjan Gohel, international security director at the Asia-Pacific Foundation, a think tank based in London.Chinese and Pakistani militaries have also engaged in increasingly sophisticated joint air, sea and land exercises, including combat simulations and even crew-swapping drills.“Beijing’s long-standing support for Islamabad – through hardware, training, and now increasingly AI-enabled targeting – has quietly shifted the tactical balance,” said Craig Singleton, a senior fellow at the US-based Foundation for Defense of Democracies.“This isn’t just a bilateral clash anymore; it’s a glimpse of how Chinese defense exports are reshaping regional deterrence.”That shift – brought into sharp focus by rising tensions between India and Pakistan following a tourist massacre in Kashmir – underscores a broader geopolitical realignment in the region, where China has emerged as a major challenge to American influence.India and Pakistan have gone to war over Kashmir three times since their independence from Britain in 1947. During the height of the Cold War, the Soviet Union backed India, while the United States and China supported Pakistan. Now, a new era of great-power rivalry looms over the long-running conflict between the nuclear-armed South Asian neighbors.Despite its traditional policy of nonalignment, India has drawn ever closer to the US, as successive American administrations courted the rising South Asian giant as a strategic counterweight to China. India has ramped up arms purchases from America and its allies, including France and Israel, while steadily reducing its reliance on Russian weaponry.Meanwhile, Pakistan has deepened ties with China, becoming its “all-weather strategic partner” and a key participant in Xi’s signature global infrastructure project, the Belt and Road Initiative. According to SIPRI’s data, the US and China each supplied about one-third of Pakistan’s imported weapons in the late 2000s. But Pakistan has stopped buying American arms in recent years and increasingly filled its arsenal with Chinese weapons.Siemon Wezeman, a senior researcher in the SIPRI Arms Transfers Program, noted that while China has been an important arms supplier to Pakistan since the mid-1960s, its current dominance largely comes from stepping into a vacuum left by the US.More than a decade ago, the US accused Pakistan of not doing enough to fight “terrorists” – including Taliban fighters – that it said were operating from or being supplied in Pakistan. Wezeman said that added to Washington’s existing frustrations over Islamabad’s nuclear program and lack of democracy.“(The US) finally found India as an alternative partner in the region. As a result, (it) more or less cut Pakistan off from US arms,” he added. “China’s arms supply on the other hand significantly increased – one can say that China used the opportunity to show itself as the only real friend and ally of Pakistan.”China has expressed regret over India’s military strikes against Pakistan and has called for calm and restraint. Before the latest escalation, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi expressed support for Pakistan in a phone call with his counterpart, calling China Pakistan’s “ironclad friend.”With Pakistan armed largely by China and India sourcing more than half of its weapons from the US and its allies, any conflict between the two neighbors could effectively be a showdown between Chinese and Western military technologies.After weeks of rising hostilities following the killing of 26 mostly Indian tourists at the hands of militants at a scenic mountain spot in Indian-administered Kashmir, India launched missile strikes early on Wednesday morning, targeting what it said was “terrorist infrastructure” in both Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir.Many analysts believe the missiles and other munitions were fired by India’s French-made Rafale and Russian-made Su-30 fighter jets.Pakistan, meanwhile, touted a great victory by its air force, claiming that five Indian fighter jets – three Rafales, a MiG-29 and a Su-30 fighter – were shot down by its J-10C fighters during an hour-long battle it claimed was fought by 125 aircraft at ranges over 160 kilometers (100 miles).“(It) is now being characterized as the most intense air-to-air combat engagement between two nuclear-armed nations,” said Salman Ali Bettani, an international relations scholar at Quaid-i-Azam University in Islamabad. “The engagement represented a milestone in the operational use of advanced Chinese-origin systems.”India has not acknowledged any aircraft losses, and Pakistan has yet to provide evidence to support its claims. But a French Defense Ministry source said at least one of India’s newest and most-advanced warplanes – a French-made Rafale fighter jet – was lost in the battle.“If … confirmed, it indicates that the weapon systems at Pakistan’s disposal are, at the minimum, contemporary or current compared to what Western Europe (especially France) offers,” said Bilal Khan, founder of Toronto-based defense analysis firm Quwa Group Inc.Despite the absence of official confirmation and hard proof, Chinese nationalists and military enthusiasts have taken to social media to celebrate what they see as a triumph for Chinese-made weapon systems.Shares of China’s state-owned AVIC Chengdu Aircraft, the maker of Pakistan’s J-10C fighter jets, closed 17% higher on the Shenzhen exchange on Wednesday, even before Pakistan’s foreign minister claimed the jets had been used to shoot down India’s planes. Shares in the company rose an additional 20% on Thursday.The J-10C is the latest version of China’s single-engine, multirole J-10 fighter, which entered service with the Chinese air force in the early 2000s. Featuring better weapon systems and avionics, the J-10C is classified as a 4.5-generation fighter – in the same tier as the Rafale but a rung below 5th-generation stealth jets, like China’s J-20 or the US F-35.China delivered the first batch of the J-10CE – the export version – to Pakistan in 2022, state broadcaster CCTV reported at the time. It’s now the most advanced fighter jet in Pakistan’s arsenal, alongside the JF-17 Block III, a 4.5-generation lightweight fighter co-developed by Pakistan and China.The Pakistan Air Force (PAF) also operates a larger fleet of American-built F-16s, one of which was used to shoot down a Soviet-designed Indian fighter jet during a flare-up in 2019.But the PAF’s F-16s are still stuck in an early-2000s configuration – far behind the upgraded versions currently offered by the US – while the Chinese-made J-10CEs and JF-17 Block IIIs feature contemporary technologies such as active electronically scanned array (AESA) radars, Khan said.“So, the F-16s are still a major piece to any PAF-led reprisal, but not the central or indispensable one,” he said.Senior Col. (ret) Zhou Bo, senior fellow at Tsinghua University’s Center for International Security and Strategy in Beijing, said if Chinese-made J-10Cs were indeed used to shoot down the French-made Rafales, it would be “a tremendous boost of confidence in Chinese weapon systems.”Zhou said it would “really raise people’s eyebrows” particularly given China has not fought a war for more than four decades. “It will potentially be a huge boost for Chinese arm sales in the international market,” he said.The United States remains the world’s largest arms exporter, accounting for 43% of global weapons exports between 2020 and 2024, according to data from SIPRI. That’s more than four times the share of France, which ranks second, followed by Russia.China ranks fourth, with nearly two-thirds of its arms exports going to a single country: Pakistan.Khan, the defense analyst in Toronto, agreed the downing, if confirmed, would go a long way in promoting China’s defense industry, noting there would likely be interest from “powers in the Middle East and North Africa” who typically can’t access “the most cutting-edge Western technology.”“With Russia set back as a result of its invasion of Ukraine, I’m sure the Chinese have begun pushing hard at Moscow’s traditional markets – e.g., Algeria, Egypt, Iraq, and Sudan – to secure big-ticket sales,” he said.Experts in Pakistan and China say the J-10Cs deployed by the Pakistan Air Force are likely to have been paired with the PL-15, China’s most advanced air-to-air missile – which has a reported beyond-visual-range of 200-300 kilometers (120-190 miles). The known export version has a reduced range of 145 kilometers (90 miles).Last week, amid spiraling tensions, the Pakistan Air Force released a three-minute video showcasing its warplanes. It featured the JF-17 Block III armed with PL-15 missiles, describing them as “PAF’s potent punch”.“From China’s perspective, this is essentially a powerful advertisement,” Antony Wong Dong, a Macau-based military observer, said of the Pakistan claims.“It will shock even countries like the United States — just how strong is its opponent, really? This is a question that all countries potentially looking to buy fighter jets, as well as China’s regional rivals, will need to seriously reconsider: how should they face this new reality?”But some experts have expressed caution. India’s losses, if confirmed, could stem more from poor tactics and planning by the Indian Air Force than from the perceived advancements in Chinese weapons.“If reports of India losing multiple jets holds up, it would raise serious questions about the IAF’s readiness, not just its platforms. The Rafales are modern, but warfighting is about integration, coordination, and survivability — not just headline acquisitions,” said Singleton, the analyst at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies.What’s also not known is what intelligence India had on the PL-15.If, for instance, it believed Pakistan only possessed the shorter-range export version, Indian aircraft might have lingered in vulnerable areas.Rules of engagement may also have prevented Indian pilots from firing first, or firing back against Pakistani aircraft, according to Fabian Hoffman, a defense policy research fellow at the University of Oslo.In such cases, Indian misjudgments may have made the Pakistani weaponry look more effective, Hoffman wrote on his Missile Matters blog.Experts also note that India’s strikes successfully hit multiple targets in Pakistan – suggesting its missiles penetrated Pakistani air defenses, which are armed with Chinese surface-to-air missiles, including the long-range HQ-9B.“If Chinese-origin radar or missile systems failed to detect or deter Indian strikes, that’s (also) bad optics for Beijing’s arms export credibility,” said Gohel, the defense expert in London.",Operation Sindoor,https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/09/china/china-military-tech-pakistan-india-conflict-intl-hnk,CNN,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""framing"", ""reason"": ""The article frames the conflict between India and Pakistan as a test of Chinese military technology, emphasizing China's role in supplying advanced weaponry to Pakistan.

155,India and Pakistan are both claiming victory after this week’s clashes. Will cooler heads prevail?,"This week’s clashes between Pakistan and India are the most serious escalation in tensions between these two historic foes in decades with millions on both sides of their border now wondering what might come next.Despite a vow to “avenge” India’s strikes on its territory, Pakistan has yet to retaliate in kind on India, and both sides appear to have already claimed victory. But hostilities continue.Palpable panic rocked both nations Wednesday after New Delhi launched targeted military strikes on its neighbor, while Islamabad claimed it had shot down its rival’s fighter jets.On Thursday, Pakistan claimed it downed at least 25 Indian loitering munition drones across the country overnight, in what it called a new “serious provocation” from New Delhi that wounded four of soldiers and killed a civilian. CNN cannot independently verify these claims and has reached out to the Indian Air Force and Ministry of Defense.The fear is that each additional confrontational step by either side could quickly spiral into an all out conflict.Indian media was euphoric after Wednesday’s strikes. “Strokes of justice,” ran an editorial from one of India’s leading English newspapers commending the country’s “sharp” and “resolute” response to the massacre of 26 people in Indian-administered Kashmir, at the hands of militants. A headline from The Indian Express echoed a similar tune: “Justice Served” it said across the front page.In Pakistan, the public response from Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif was similarly bellicose.He has vowed to “avenge” the deaths of 31 people Pakistan says were killed in India’s strikes but still appeared to declare triumph for its apparent shooting of India’s airplanes.“It only took a few hours for the enemy to fall on its knees,” he said in a late-night address to the nation.India says it struck “terrorist infrastructure” belonging to two Islamist groups – Lashkar-e-Tayyiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed – who have been accused of being behind some the deadliest militant attacks on the country. Wednesday’s strikes did not target military infrastructure and didn’t kill civilians, New Delhi said, potentially giving India and Pakistan an opportunity to find a way to avoid an all-out war.One location India struck was deep in Pakistan’s Punjab province, the deepest attack in Pakistan’s undisputed territory since both countries fought a major war in 1971. It also targeted multiple other locations in Punjab – the heartland of the powerful military and home of the Sharif government – and hit a mosque, according to Pakistani officials, angering millions in the Muslim-majority nation.What happens now, analysts say, mostly depends on Islamabad’s next move.“All eyes are on Pakistan,” said Washington-based South Asia analyst, Michael Kugelman. “If it decides to save face and claim victory — perhaps by pointing to the downing of Indian jets (which New Delhi has not confirmed) — and call it a day, an off ramp could be in sight.”But he warned “all bets would be off” should Pakistan decide to strike back.Most analysts agree the nuclear-armed neighbors cannot afford another battle.India and Pakistan have already fought three wars over Kashmir, a contested region they both claim in its entirety and each control a part of. Another conflict could have catastrophic consequences.Since its birth seven decades ago in the partition of what was British India, Pakistan – now home to 230 million people – has faced mounting challenges, from political instability to an alarming militant insurgency, climate catastrophes and economic disarray.India is seemingly in a stronger position; its military is seen as superior in any conventional conflict based on number alone and it boasts an economy more than 10 times the size of Pakistan’s. But it too would have something to lose should the conflict escalate, according to Tanvi Madan, a senior fellow in the Foreign Policy program at the Brookings Institution.“Largely on the basis of what we’ve seen in previous times, these are two rational actors who don’t want a broader war,” Madan said.India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi has vowed to elevate India’s status on the global stage, bidding to host the Olympics and seeking to overtake China as the world’s manufacturing hub.Not to mention, India already faces security threats on multiple fronts — particularly along contested borders with China.India was quick to project that its response to the April 22 massacre was “focused, measured and non-escalatory” and make clear that they were in response to the tourist’s massacre.Top officials in New Delhi reached out to key counterparts in the United States, Middle East and Russia, among others, “presumably to encourage international pressure for Pakistan to avoid escalation,” said Nisha Biswal, Senior Advisor at The Asia Group.Pakistan’s leaders touted a victory by the country’s air force, saying five Indian fighter jets were shot down during an hour-long battle fought at ranges over 160 kilometers (100 miles).India’s leaders have said little in response to those claims and have not acknowledged any aircraft losses. The Pakistanis have yet to show any evidence proving they downed fighter jets, but a French Defense Ministry source said at least one of India’s newest and most-advanced warplanes – a French-made Rafale fighter jet – was lost in the battle.If there have indeed been losses for India, Pakistan could claim victory “even if the circumstances are murky,” said Milan Vaishnav, a senior fellow and director of the South Asia Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.“This would allow Pakistan to claim it has imposed costs on Indian military targets.”Yet, amid the fog of war, Pakistan’s powerful army general Asim Munir had already vowed to match any aggression from India.And Munir, who is known for his hardline stance on Hindu-nationalist Modi, has a reputation of being more assertive than his predecessor Qamar Javed Bajwa.Meanwhile there have been many voices within Modi’s Hindu nationalist party pushing for a decisive blow against Pakistan for years.Kugelman, the South Asia analyst, said the US, which has historically interceded in these crises, could try to defuse the tension, but it’s unclear how much bandwidth the Trump administration is willing to allocate.“China has called for de-escalation, but its fraught ties with India rule it out as a viable intermediary. The top mediator candidates are the Arab Gulf states, especially Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates,” he said, given their strong ties with both nations.Qatar was quick to urge diplomacy in the hours after Wednesday’s strikes.While most analysts think there is an off-ramp for both nations, they all agree the situation remains fluid and tense.“This crisis is as unpredictable as it is dangerous—an unsettling combination,” Kugelman added.",Operation Sindoor,https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/08/asia/india-pakistan-analysis-what-happens-next-intl-hnk,CNN,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""framing"", ""reason"": ""The article frames the situation as a 'crisis' and emphasizes the potential for an 'all-out conflict', which may create a sense of urgency and alarm, influencing readers' perceptions."", ""confidence"": 0.8}",yes,framing,"frames the situation as a 'crisis' and emphasizes the potential for an 'all-out conflict', which may create a sense of urgency and alarm, influencing readers' perceptions"
156,Pakistan and India are blaming each other as their Kashmir conflict spirals. Here’s what we know,"Tensions between India and Pakistan remain high days after Delhi launched airstrikes on its neighbor, sparking tit-for-tat military action from both sides this week and widespread confusion as competing claims and disinformation spread online.Many countries are calling for restraint, fearing a wider devastating conflict could erupt. And they are also watching closely to see how weapons from both sides, acquired from China and parts of Europe, fare against each other in conflict. Saudi Arabia’s minister of state for foreign affairs arrived in Pakistan’s capital on Friday on a potential mission to calm tensions. The same day, UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy spoke to both his Indian and Pakistani counterparts.The latest escalation between the longtime foes has killed dozens on both sides so far. India’s initial Wednesday airstrikes killed at least 31 people and wounded 46 others, while Pakistani shelling from across the border have killed at least 16 civilians in the India-administered part of the disputed region of Kashmir, according to military and defense officials from both sides.Further casualties were reported after both sides alleged drone strikes from the other – though Pakistan has denied carrying out such an attack, and India has not yet responded to the claims. CNN has not been able to independently verify these figures.Meanwhile on the ground, fear and panic have set in on both sides of the border, especially in Kashmir, with residents sheltering in bunkers and reporting the sounds of explosions. Videos and photos show houses reduced to rubble, and streets deserted as people stay home.The Indian Premier League cricket tournament, the most popular and richest league in the world, has been suspended for one week, said the sport’s national governing board, citing concern for the players.The trigger for all this was a massacre in April that saw gunmen storm a scenic mountain spot in India-administered Kashmir and kill 26 people, mostly Indian tourists. India blamed Pakistan for the attack, which Islamabad denied.Here’s what we know so far.India launched “Operation Sindoor” in the early hours of Wednesday morning local time (Tuesday night ET) in both Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir.Indian officials claimed no Pakistani civilian, economic or military sites were struck in the 25-minute operation, which targeted the “terrorist infrastructure” of two militant groups – Lashkar-e-Tayyiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed.Indian officials argued the strikes were a “proportionate” response to the April massacre, and that Pakistan’s response afterward escalated the situation.But Pakistan is painting a different picture of the strikes – saying civilians were killed and mosques were hit across six locations. CNN has yet to verify those claims.Some of those strikes hit the densely populated province of Punjab, Pakistan’s military said, and were the deepest India has struck inside Pakistan since one of their wars in 1971.After the initial attack on Wednesday, Pakistan claimed it had used Chinese-made fighter jets to shoot down down five Indian Air Force jets – including three Rafales, sophisticated French-made jets that New Delhi only acquired a few years ago.Uncertainty continues to swirl around these claims, as India’s government and military have stayed silent on the matter. CNN has been unable to verify the claim, and has reached out to the Indian Air Force and Ministry of Defense for comment.But both the United States and France have assessed that Pakistan shot down at least one Rafale, senior officials from both countries told CNN. France is still investigating whether any more jets were brought down.And multiple reports of plane crashes in Indian territory have emerged.In India’s Punjab state, eyewitnesses and a local government official told CNN a plane crashed out of the night sky in the early hours of Wednesday – around the same time Pakistan claims it shot down the jets. The official told CNN the aircraft was unidentified but “seems to be ours.”In Indian-administered Kashmir, eyewitnesses and a local official in the village of Wuyan said an unidentified aircraft crashed on Wednesday. Photos by AFP news agency showed plane wreckage, though it’s unclear who the aircraft belongs to or what brought it down.India said on Thursday it has targeted air defense systems in several locations in Pakistan – after initially saying it would not target Pakistani military installations.On Friday both countries alleged the other had launched attacks or carried out firing during the previous night. An Indian military official claimed Pakistan targeted 36 Indian sites with 300 to 400 drones overnight on Thursday – which Islamabad has denied.The official also said Pakistan’s military fired heavy-caliber artillery guns across the Line of Control that divides Kashmir, resulting in the deaths and injuries of some Indian army personnel. She added that Pakistan’s army also suffered “major losses” in Indian retaliatory fire.Speaking to CNN on Friday, a senior Pakistani government source strongly rejected assertions that Pakistan had launched drone strikes against India. While acknowledging heavy shelling across the Line of Control, the source said Pakistan had not yet used any of its drones.CNN is unable to verify either of these claims, and has reached out to both Pakistani and Indian governments for comment.On Thursday, Pakistan’s information ministry claimed their forces have killed between 40 and 50 Indian soldiers along the Line of Control. CNN cannot verify the figures, and has sought comment from the Indian defense ministry.The ongoing conflict and back-and-forth claims have sowed confusion and disruption on both sides of the border, with blackouts, drills and flight changes impacting daily life.A resident living in Pakistani-administered Kashmir told CNN on Friday that tensions are high for those living near the de facto border. “Our area is not in liveable condition. There has been heavily shelling in the area,” Mukhtar Qureshi, a local resident from a village at the Chakothi sector, said.Muslim-majority Kashmir has been a flashpoint in India-Pakistan relations since both countries gained their independence from Britain in 1947.The two nations to emerge from the bloody partition of British India – Hindu-majority India and Muslim-majority Pakistan – both claim Kashmir in full and, months after becoming independent, fought their first of three wars over the territory.The divided region is now one of the most militarized places in the world.India has long accused Pakistan of harboring militant groups there that conduct attacks across the border, something Islamabad has long denied.The massacre in the tourist hotspot of Pahalgam in April sparked widespread anger in India, putting heavy pressure on the Hindu-nationalist government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.India immediately blamed Islamabad, sparking tit-for-tat retaliatory measures in which both countries downgraded ties, canceled visas for each other’s citizens, and saw India pull out of a key water-sharing treaty.The last India-Pakistan war over Kashmir in 1999 killed more than 1,000 Pakistani troops, by the most conservative estimates.In the decades since, the two countries have clashed multiple times, most recently in 2019 when India conducted airstrikes in Pakistan after it blamed Islamabad for a suicide car bomb attack in the region.But those recent clashes did not explode into all-out war. Both sides are aware of the risks; since 1999, the two countries have worked to strengthen their militaries, including arming themselves with nuclear weapons.CNN’s Hira Humayun and Nic Robertson contributed to this story.",Operation Sindoor,https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/07/asia/operation-sindoor-india-pakistan-attack-wwk-intl-hnk,CNN,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""framing"", ""reason"": ""The article frames the conflict as a 'tit-for-tat' situation, implying equal blame on both sides.

157,"India strikes deep inside Pakistan, Pakistan claims 5 Indian jets shot down, in major escalation","India launched military strikes on targets in Pakistan, both countries said on Wednesday and Pakistan claimed it had shot down five Indian Air Force jets, in an escalation that has pushed the two nations to the brink of wider conflict.India’s missile strikes early Wednesday morning targeted “terrorist infrastructure” across nine sites in Pakistan’s densely populated Punjab province and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, it said. They came in response to a massacre by militants of tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir two weeks ago, that New Delhi blamed on its neighbor.Pakistan said at least 26 people were killed in Wednesday’s strikes – including women and a three-year-old girl – and 46 wounded. The country’s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif described the strikes as “an act of war” and Islamabad has vowed to retaliate.From early Wednesday the two sides have exchanged shelling across their border, with locals on both sides telling CNN they were taking shelter. A CNN journalist in Pakistan-administered Kashmir heard multiple loud explosions.“A shell landed at a house close to the mosque in which two people were injured. Shells also hit other houses in our area and we fled from our area to a safer place,” said Shakeel Butt, a resident of Muzaffarabad, in Pakistani-administered Kashmir. A senior Indian defense source said at least eight people had been killed on the Indian side of the border.Pakistani military sources later said they shot down five Indian Air Force jets and one drone in “self-defense,” claiming three Rafale jets – sophisticated multi-role fighters made in France – were among those downed as well as a MiG-29 and an SU-30 fighter.A local resident and government official told CNN that an unidentified fighter aircraft had crashed on a school building in Indian-administered Kashmir.Photos published by AFP news agency showed aircraft wreckage lying in a field next to a red-brick building. But it was not immediately clear from the pictures of the wreckage who the aircraft belonged to.CNN cannot independently verify the claim and has reached out to the Indian government for a response. At a later press conference where Indian officials said their strikes had targeted training camps belonging to militant groups Lashkar-e-Tayyiba (LeT) and Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), officials did not address the claims and took no questions from the media.Indian jets have previously bombed Pakistani territory following militant attacks on its soil but Wednesday’s operation is the deepest India has struck inside its neighbor since the Indo-Pakistan war of 1971, the biggest of several wars between the two countries.The situation is now “obviously serious and fluid,” said Fahd Humayun, an assistant professor of political science at Tufts University. “Retaliation to India’s actions will likely now be inevitable.”India dubbed its military action “Operation Sindoor” – a reference to the red vermilion, or powder, many Hindu women wear on their foreheads after marriage. It is a symbolic nod to April’s massacre on civilians that left several women widowed.World leaders and the United Nations have expressed concern over the strikes and have urged restraint from both countries. The US Department of State said it was “closely monitoring” the flare-up.Muslim-majority Pakistan and Hindu-majority India have inched closer to open conflict since gunmen massacred 26 people in a popular holiday spot in Indian-administered Kashmir last month, with India’s Hindu-nationalist government under intense pressure from its base to respond to the attack.Pakistan was swift to deny any link to the attack but in the days following, both countries swiftly downgraded ties with each other and have since been engaging in escalating tit-for-tat hostilities.Analysts said it was a question of when, not if, India retaliated.India said its strikes were “focused, measured and non-escalatory in nature.”“No Pakistani military facilities have been targeted. India has demonstrated considerable restraint in selection of targets and method of execution,” its defense ministry said in a statement.The strikes have put the region on alert, with commercial airlines keeping almost entirely clear of Pakistani airspace, flight-tracking website Flightradar24 showed. The airport in Srinagar, ﻿Indian-administered Kashmir’s biggest city, has been closed to civilian traffic, and several airlines have suspended or diverted flights to Pakistan and northwest India.Video obtained by CNN on Wednesday showed chaotic scenes at a hospital in Pakistan’s Punjab province, as the wounded were rushed for treatment.Muslim-majority Kashmir has been a flashpoint in India-Pakistan relations since both countries gained their independence from Britain in 1947.The two nations that emerged from the bloody partition of British India both claim Kashmir in full and, months after becoming independent, fought their first of three wars over the territory.The divided region is now one of the most militarized places in the world.For decades, several domestic militant groups, demanding either independence for Kashmir or for the area to become part of Pakistan, have fought Indian security forces, with tens of thousands killed.India has long accused Pakistan of harboring these militant groups – a charge Islamabad denies – and had vowed to retaliate against those they deemed responsible.Tensions over Kashmir have also surged in recent years, after Indian Prime Minister Modi’s government revoked the region’s constitutional autonomy in 2019, bringing it under the direct control of New Delhi.Observers say a response from Pakistan to the strikes will be likely, and concern now turns to how to manage what comes next.“Pakistan‘s response is sure to come. The challenge would be to manage the next level of escalation. This is where crisis diplomacy will matter,” said Ajay Bisaria, former high commissioner of India to Pakistan.",Operation Sindoor,https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/06/asia/india-pakistan-kashmir-conflict-hnk-intl,CNN,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""framing"", ""reason"": ""The article frames India's military strikes as a response to 'terrorist infrastructure' and 'militant attacks', while Pakistan is described as having 'vowed to retaliate'.

158,Pakistan claims it has ‘credible intelligence’ India will strike within 36 hours,"Tensions between India and Pakistan have escalated further after a top Pakistani official claimed early Wednesday to have “credible intelligence” that New Delhi will carry out a military action against Islamabad within the next two days.The claim came as both the United States and China urged restraint.“Pakistan has credible intelligence that India intends carrying out military action against Pakistan in the next 24-36 hours,” Pakistan’s Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said in an unusual middle of the night post on X. He did not elaborate on what evidence Pakistan had used to make the claim.Tarar’s comments come just one week after militants massacred 26 tourists in the mountainous town of Pahalgam in Indian-administered Kashmir, a rampage that has sparked widespread outrage.India has accused Pakistan of being involved in the attack — a claim Islamabad denies. Pakistan has offered a neutral investigation into the incident. CNN has contacted India’s defense ministry for response to Tarar’s claims.The Director Generals of Military Operations of both countries spoke over a hotline on Tuesday, India’s state broadcaster and Pakistan’s military confirmed on Wednesday - the first conversation between the military officials since the Pahalgam attack.Kashmir, one of the world’s most dangerous flashpoints, is controlled in part by India and Pakistan but both countries claim it in its entirety.The two nuclear-armed rivals have fought three wars over the mountainous territory that is now divided by a de-facto border called the Line of Control since their independence from Britain nearly 80 years ago.Last week’s attack sparked immediate widespread anger in India and Prime Minister Narendra Modi is under tremendous pressure to retaliate with force.India conducted airstrikes inside Pakistan in 2019 following a major insurgent attack on paramilitary personnel inside Indian-administered Kashmir. It was the first such incursion into Pakistan’s territory since a 1971 war between the two neighbors.The latest attack on tourists in Kashmir has sparked fears that India might respond in a similar way.Modi vowed to pursue the attackers “to the ends of the earth” in a fiery speech last week. The massacre set off an escalating tit-for-tat exchange of hostilities between the two countries over the past week.Pakistan’s Tarar on Wednesday claimed any “military adventurism by India would be responded to assuredly and decisively.”US Secretary of State Marco Rubio spoke with India’s external affairs minister and Pakistan’s prime minister, urging the two countries to work together to “de-escalate tensions,” according to State Department readouts of the two calls on Wednesday.In his call with Pakistan’s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, Rubio “spoke of the need to condemn the terror attack on April 22 in Pahalgam” and urged Pakistani officials’ cooperation in investigating the attack in the Kashmiri town. Rubio also encouraged Sharif to “re-establish direct communications” with India, the readout saidNew Delhi is considered an important partner for Washington as it seeks to counter China’s influence in the Indo-Pacific region. Pakistan is also considered a key US partner.China, which also claims control of part of Kashmir and has grown closer to Pakistan in recent years, has also urged restraint.China’s foreign minister Wang Yi spoke to Pakistan’s deputy prime minister and foreign minister Ishaq Dar last week, saying any conflict between Pakistan and India would “not serve the fundamental interests of each side” and posed a risk to regional security, state broadcaster CGTN reported.India and China’s relationship has proved fractious in recent years, with clashes at their contested border. Meanwhile, Beijing and Islamabad have strengthened ties, with China continuing to invest in Pakistan under its Belt and Road Initiative.In the days after the Pahalgam attack, both countries swiftly downgraded ties with each other.India canceled visa of Pakistani nationals, and Pakistan responded with a reciprocal move. Both countries have told diplomats and citizens to return home before April 30.India has also suspended its participation in a crucial water-sharing pact and both sides have now banned each other’s airlines from their respective air spaces.The Indus Water Treaty has been in force since 1960 and is regarded as a rare diplomatic success story between the two fractious neighbors.The treaty governs the sharing of water from the enormous Indus River system, a vital resource supporting hundreds of millions of livelihoods across Pakistan and northern India. The Indus originates in Tibet and flows through China and Indian-controlled Kashmir before reaching Pakistan.Islamabad has called any attempt to stop or divert water belonging to Pakistan an act of war.This week, New Delhi and Islamabad have both been flexing their military might.Pakistan shot down an Indian drone that was used for “espionage” in the disputed Kashmir region on Tuesday, Pakistani security sources told CNN.Two days earlier, India’s navy said it had carried out test missile strikes to “revalidate and demonstrate readiness of platforms, systems and crew for long range precision offensive strike.”Tensions have been also been simmering along the Line of Control and gunfire has been exchanged along the disputed border for six straight nights.This is a developing story and will be updated.",Operation Sindoor,https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/29/asia/kashmir-pakistan-india-tension-military-intl-hnk,CNN,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""source"", ""reason"": ""The article relies heavily on Pakistani and US sources, while Indian responses are limited to a single statement from the defense ministry."", ""confidence"": 0.8}",yes,source," relies heavily on Pakistani and US sources, while Indian responses are limited to a single statement from the defense ministry"
159,A tourist massacre in Kashmir is escalating tensions between India and Pakistan. Here’s what we know,"Relations between India and Pakistan are cratering following a deadly militant attack in Indian-administered Kashmir that has sparked tit-for-tat reprisals and raised fears of another military escalation between the nuclear-armed rivals.India and Pakistan both control parts of Kashmir but claim it in full, and have fought three wars over the mountainous territory. In 2019, Indian jets bombed targets inside Pakistan after a cross-border militant attack killed at least 40 Indian paramilitary personnel in its part of Kashmir.All but one of the 26 tourists massacred in the attack on April 22 were Indian citizens. New Delhi swiftly pointed the finger at Pakistan, downgraded ties and suspended its participation in a crucial water-sharing treaty.Pakistan has denied involvement and said that any attempt to stop or divert water belonging to Pakistan would be considered an act of war.As tensions escalate, India’s navy said it launched test missile strikes in a show of strength.India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi has vowed to pursue the attackers “to the ends of the earth,” while the United Nations has called on the neighbors to exercise “maximum restraint.”Here’s what you need to know.Gunmen opened fire on sightseers in a popular travel destination in the mountainous destination of Pahalgam in Indian-administered Kashmir.At least 25 Indian citizens and one Nepali national were killed in the massacre, which unfolded in a valley only accessible by foot or on horseback.Eyewitnesses described scenes of horror as the gunmen approached, opening fire on tourists from close range.Some recalled how the men among the group were singled out and shot at. Other survivors told local media the gunmen accused some of the victims of supporting Prime Minister Modi.Modi’s Hindu-nationalist government revoked Muslim-majority Kashmir’s constitutional autonomy in 2019, bringing it under the direct control of New Delhi, sparking widespread protests.Kashmir has been a flashpoint in India-Pakistan relations since both countries gained their independence from Britain in 1947.The two nations to emerge from the bloody partition of British India – Hindu-majority India and Muslim-majority Pakistan – both claim Kashmir in full and, months after becoming independent, fought their first of three wars over the territory.The divided region is now one of the most militarized places in the world.For decades, several domestic militant groups, demanding either independence for Kashmir or for the area to become part of Pakistan, have fought Indian security forces, in violence that has killed tens of thousands. India says those groups are supported by Pakistan, which Islamabad denies.Modi’s government has said that militancy has declined since the revocation of Kashmir’s autonomy in 2019. Analysts say the Pahalgam massacre has shattered that message.DIt is not clear who is responsible for the Pahalgam attack.A relatively new militant outfit called Kashmir Resistance, also known as The Resistance Front (TRF),  initially claimed responsibility on social media but it has reportedly since walked back that claim, according to multiple local media reports.CNN could not independently verify the initial claim, nor the subsequent withdrawal, and has reached out to the Indian army and police in Indian-administered Kashmir for comment.India has classified TRF as a “terrorist organization” and linked it to the outlawed Islamist group Lashkar-e-Tayyiba (LeT), which was behind the deadly Mumbai attacks in 2008 and has a much higher profile.Two days after the massacre, police in Indian-administered Kashmir published notices naming three LeT suspects allegedly involved in the attack. Two of the three are Pakistani nationals, according to the notices.They did not say how the men were identified.India has justified its retaliatory moves as a response to Pakistan’s alleged “support for cross-border terrorism.”New Delhi has closed a key border crossing and further restricted already limited visas for Pakistani citizens. It also expelled military, naval and air advisers from the Pakistani High Commission in New Delhi.Additionally, it suspended its role in the Indus Water Treaty, an important water-sharing pact between India and Pakistan that has been in force since 1960 and is regarded as a rare diplomatic success story between the two fractious neighbors.The enormous Indus River system, which supports hundreds of millions of livelihoods across Pakistan and northern India, originates in Tibet, flowing through China and Indian-controlled Kashmir before reaching Pakistan. The vast volume of water is a vital resource for both countries, and the treaty governs how it is shared.A Pakistan government statement said any attempt to stop or divert water belonging to Pakistan would be considered an act of war.Following India’s move, Pakistan said it was suspending trade with India, closing its airspace and expelling Indian diplomats, calling New Delhi’s measures “unilateral, unjust, politically motivated, extremely irresponsible and devoid of legal merit.”Pakistan’s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on April 26 accused New Delhi of leveling “baseless allegations” against Islamabad and said it was “open to participating in any neutral, transparent and credible investigation.”The next day, India’s navy said it conducted “anti-ship firings” to “revalidate and demonstrate readiness of platforms, systems and crew for long range precision offensive strike,” in a statement on X.Tensions are heightened in Kashmir as Indian security forces continue to search for the suspects in the attack. Indian forces were “engaged in a gunfight with militants” in Bandipora district north of Srinagar during the search, the Indian army corps in Kashmir said on X.Meanwhile, India’s army chief Gen. Upendra Dwivedi visited Kashmir on April 25 to “to assess the security situation in the region.”Arshad Najam, 48, a school teacher who lives in Pakistan-administered Kashmir close to the line that divides the territory, said he was on edge.“We have cleaned our bunker,” he told CNN. “There is fear among people… anything can occur at any moment.”Thousands have flocked to the streets in recent days to condemn the deadly attacks as business owners express concerns over the impact it has already had on the popular tourist destination during peak season.“We all could not just sit by and watch. We came out to show emotion, solidarity, and condemn the killings,” said local resident Umar Nazir Tibetbaqan.Meanwhile, anti-Pakistan protests have erupted in India’s capital Delhi and several other cities, raising fears of fueling anti-Kashmiri and anti-Muslim sentiment.All eyes are now on how New Delhi and Islamabad will respond, with analysts fearing the potential for military escalation.“Modi will have a very strong, if not irresistible, political compulsion to retaliate with force,” said Arzan Tarapore, a research scholar from Stanford University’s Center for International Security and Cooperation.“We don’t know what that would look like, and it’s somewhat meaningless to speculate at this point, but I think the 2019 Balakot crisis provides some cues on what to watch for in India’s response,” Tarapore said, referring to New Delhi’s response to a militant attack on Indian troops which killed at least 40 paramilitary personnel in Indian-administered Kashmir.New Delhi retaliated by launching airstrikes on Pakistan, the first such incursion into its territory since a 1971 war between the two.“The key question will be will they seek to impose more meaningful, tangible costs on terrorist groups, including by targeting their leadership or headquarters facilities? Or will India go even further, crossing the threshold to attack the Pakistan army?” Tarapore said.",Operation Sindoor,https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/24/india/pahalgam-india-pakistan-attack-explainer-intl-hnk,CNN,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""framing"", ""reason"": ""The article frames the conflict as a result of Pakistan's alleged 'support for cross-border terrorism', while also implying that India's actions are justified in response.

160,India’s Modi opens Ram temple built on site of demolished mosque in Ayodhya,"India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi has opened a Hindu temple built on the ruins of a historic Mughal-era mosque in the northern town of Ayodhya.Monday’s consecration of the temple, dedicated to Lord Ram, embodies the triumph of Modi’s muscular Hindu nationalist politics and marks an unofficial start to his re-election campaign in general elections scheduled later this year.Modi, in flowing golden-coloured traditional dress, unveiled the black stone idol to the deity in the heart of the 50-metre-high (164 feet) temple in Ayodhya, nearly 700km (435 miles) east of New Delhi.The temple has been built on grounds where the Babri mosque, named after Mughal emperor Babur, stood for centuries before it was torn down in 1992 by a Hindu mob.The demolition of the 16th-century mosque triggered the worst religious riots since independence – killing more than 2,000 people, most of them Muslims – and shook the foundations of India’s officially secular political order.Modi on Monday chanted Hindu religious verses before placing flower petals at the feet of the deity and clasped his palms in prayer, then bowed before it and circled a sacred flame, while outside, a military helicopter showered petals on the temple.Traditional clarinets played devotional music during the rituals for the 130cm (51-inch) tall, black stone deity that represents the god-king while politicians, businessmen, sports and film celebrities watched along with millions nationwide.“January 22, 2024 is not merely a date in the calendar but heralds the advent of a new era,” Modi said, speaking outside the temple after the consecration.Most of India’s opposition parties, including the Indian National Congress, declined the invite to the event, saying it did not befit a secular India.But for Modi, the temple’s opening is a landmark moment in a decades-long campaign to align the country’s governance with its majority faith.Hindus make up about 80 percent of India, the world’s most populous country, which is also home to some 200 million Muslims who have frequently come under attack by Hindu nationalists since Modi’s rise to power in 2014.The temple is the sacred abode of Ram, one of the Hindu pantheon’s most popular gods.Millions of Hindus worship Ram with a belief that chanting his name in times of adversity will bring peace and prosperity, and most of those who practice Hinduism keep idols of Ram in their homes.Major Hindu festivals such as Dussehra and Diwali are associated with mythological tales of Ram extolling the virtues of truth, sacrifice and ethical governance.The mythological Hindu epic Ramayan, which tells the story of Ram’s journey from prince to king, has often been adapted in popular culture. One of the most-viewed fabled shows is the TV series Ramayan, created in the 1980s, which continues to have a faithful audience.Ram’s divinity is not only the dominant religious force in India but also part of the ancient cultural heritage in countries like Thailand, Indonesia, Myanmar and Malaysia.Devout Hindus believe Ram was born in Ayodhya more than 7,000 years ago, but that the Babri mosque was built over his birthplace by one of Babur’s generals. That put the town at the centre of India’s turbulent politics and the Hindu majoritarian quest to redeem the country’s religious past for decades.In December 1949, authorities seized the mosque after members of a right-wing Hindu group placed idols of Ram inside the disputed structure. Court orders barred the removal of the idols, and the structure’s use as a mosque effectively ceased.Hindu and Muslim groups filed separate claims over the site and the structure. In 1989, another court ordered the maintenance of the status quo.Hindu and Muslim groups tried unsuccessfully to resolve the dispute through talks, before the BJP launched a nationwide campaign in 1990 to build the temple.Lal Krishna Advani, the president of the party at the time, embarked on a cross-country journey on a truck fitted out to resemble an ancient chariot. It whipped up Hindu fervour, deepening rifts with Muslims but also catapulting the party to national prominence.The BJP campaign climaxed in a rally in Ayodhya on December 6, 1992, when a mob climbed the mosque and smashed its domes with axes and hammers, levelling the entire structure. The event triggered sectarian riots in several parts of India, killing about 2,000 people, mostly Muslims.As a foot soldier of the party at the time, Modi helped organise the chariot’s journey, which began in his home state of Gujarat. He rode to the office of prime minister in 2014 on a Hindu nationalist platform that included the promise to build the Ram temple.Hindus won a prolonged legal battle in 2019, allowing them to build the temple, while the Muslims were given a plot miles away from the site of the razed Babri mosque to build a new structure.In 2020, Modi, the face of an unprecedented and unapologetic fusion of religion and politics in India, led the Ram temple’s groundbreaking ceremony. But critics say the idea of a diverse, constitutionally secular state leading a Hindu religious ritual is deplorable.",Ayodhya Ram Mandir,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/22/indias-modi-opens-ram-temple-built-on-site-of-demolished-mosque-in-ayodhya,AL JAZEERA,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""framing"", ""reason"": ""The article frames the event as a 'triumph of Modi's muscular Hindu nationalist politics' and emphasizes its significance in his re-election campaign, implying that the temple's opening is a key aspect of Modi's agenda."", ""confidence"": 0.8}",yes,framing,"frames the event as a 'triumph of Modi's muscular Hindu nationalist politics' and emphasizes its significance in his re-election campaign, implying that the temple's opening is a key aspect of Modi's agenda"
161,Babri mosque to Ram temple: A timeline from 1528 to 2024,"India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi has inaugurated a grand temple to the Hindu God Ram in Ayodhya in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, culminating a four-decade campaign to build the temple by Hindu far-right groups.The temple, popularly known as Ram Mandir, is being constructed on the land where a 16th-century mosque stood until 1992, when Hindu far-right mobs demolished it, triggering a nationwide Hindu-Muslim riots that killed more than 2,000 people, most of them Muslims.Hindus claim the Babri Masjid was built on the site of a temple during the first Mughal ruler Babur, on land that was the birthplace of their chief deity Ram. Muslims offered prayers until 1949 when idols were placed inside the mosque allegedly by Hindu priests.An Indian Supreme Court ruling in 2019 gave ownership of the land to a Hindu trust. The inauguration of the temple is being seen as a symbol of religious triumphalism, turning India’s secular democracy into a Hindu-first nation, further polarising politics that will likely benefit the governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) months ahead of general elections.Here is a timeline of the mosque-temple dispute:Babri Mosque is built by Mughal commander Mir Baqi under the rule of the first Mughal king, Babur.A Hindu sect claims that a temple was destroyed during Babur’s reign to make way for the mosque.The British colonial administration partitions the site into two separate sections for Hindus and Muslims. Muslims allowed to pray inside, while Hindus allowed to worship in the outer courtyard.The government declares the mosque a “disputed property” and locks its gate after idols of Ram deity are allegedly placed by Hindu priests inside the structure, according to police reports. No Muslim prayers offered at the mosque after that.Four civil suits are filed in the court ranging from the rights to perform Hindu rituals at the site to a Muslim group seeking declaration and possession of the site.A committee is formed by Hindu far-right groups, including the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP), to spearhead the construction of a Hindu temple.BJP leader Lal Krishna Advani leads a nationwide campaign to build a temple in the place of the mosque. The nationwide campaign leaves a trail of violence in its wake, resulting in Advani’s arrest in the eastern state of Bihar.Tens of thousands of Hindus gather in Ayodhya, pulling down the 16th-century mosque. Hindu-Muslim riots break out across the country.Ten days after the demolition of the mosque, the central government forms the Liberhan Commission to investigate the incident.Archaeologists begin a court-directed survey to determine whether a Hindu temple existed at the site. The survey says there is evidence of a temple beneath the mosque, but many archaeologists and Muslims dispute the findings.The commission submits its report 17 years after the demolition of the mosque. The report names several leaders of the BJP and its ideological mentor Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) as responsible for the demolition of the mosque. Some senior BJP leaders, including Advani, face trial.Three judges of the Allahabad High Court rule that Hindus and Muslims should share the disputed site.

162,Why is India’s Ram temple in Ayodhya controversial?,"India’s stock market is shut for the day. Central government offices are only open for half the day. Neighbourhood watch parties have been organised across the country. And tens of millions of Indians are tuned into one event: the consecration of a temple to the Hindu god Ram in the city of Ayodhya.On Monday, just past noon local time, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi will join priests to inaugurate the temple, whose launch in many ways also serves as the start of his campaign to be re-elected for a third term in office in national elections due to be held between March and May.The trust in charge of the temple, whose construction is still under way, has invited an estimated 7,000 people — politicians, leading industrialists, sports stars and other public figures.But while Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government has pitched the event as a national celebration, the temple’s history is grounded in what many have dubbed one of modern India’s darkest chapters — one that has shaped the country’s politics and that cracked open deep religious fault lines in its society.Here’s a look at the tortured history of the spot where the temple is being built — and the controversies surrounding it.The temple is being built on a contentious piece of land in the northern Indian city of Ayodhya, at a spot that many Hindus believe was the birthplace of Ram, a much-worshipped god who in the religion epitomises the victory of good over evil.But until the morning of December 6, 1992, it was the Babri Masjid, a mosque built in 1528 and named after the Mughal king Babur, that stood at that place. A mob of Hindu nationalists pulled down the mosque, chanting religious slogans, after more than a decade of an angry, and at times violent, campaign.After years of being closed to the public, in November 2019, India’s Supreme Court ruled that the site must be handed over to a trust that would be specially set up to oversee the construction of a Hindu temple.A separate piece of land in Dhannipur village on the outskirts of Ayodhya, was allocated to Muslims for a mosque that may serve as a replacement for the Babri Masjid. Its construction is yet to begin.“Through the highest court now, we have established a principle of creating an unbreakable divide between Hindus and Muslims, that they cannot live side by side,” said writer and academic Apoorvanand on the “five-acre justice,” a term Indians have penned over the size of the reallocated land.While some segments of India’s population cheered on the judgement, others criticised it for lacking a sound legal basis and compromising on India’s secular and democratic constitutional ethics.Locals have also pointed to the history of harmonious co-existence between the two communities in Ayodhya, even at places of worship. The ruling also sparked fears that it was emboldening right-wing Hindus across the country to launch similar efforts to raze other mosques.Although the Ram Temple controversy goes back decades, Apoorvanand says that Monday’s event is “also a final announcement of, in a way, Hindus handing over their religion to the will of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh.” The RSS is the Hindu-nationalist mothership of the BJP and its far-right partner organisations.The temple’s inauguration seals the site as a place of Hindu worship, and comes after years of legal tussles and even violent riots over the land and its legacy.The first recorded instance of conflict over the site was in 1853, when a Hindu sect asserted that a temple had been demolished during Babur’s era to make way for the mosque.Tensions especially started to take a turn in 1859 when British colonial rulers partitioned the building into separate sections – the inside for Muslims, and the outer court for Hindus.In 1949, just two years after the subcontinent won independence, the mosque turned into disputed property. Police reports show that Hindu idols were brought into the mosque and its gates were closed. No Muslim prayers were offered at the mosque after that. In 1950, several civil suits were filed with both communities laying claim to the site.But it was outside the courts that the fate of the Babri Masjid was ultimately decided.In the 1980s, the BJP that now dominates Indian politics was largely a fringe party. But it built political momentum around a nationwide campaign to build a temple in the place of the mosque, led by then party chief Lal Krishna Advani, who would later serve as India’s deputy prime minister (1998-2004).Under pressure from the BJP and its Hindu majoritarian allies and the support they were galvanising, the government of then Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, of the Indian National Congress, allowed a court decision to open the locks of the Babri Masjid site to go unchallenged in 1986.That, however, only emboldened the BJP-led agitation. In 1990, Advani led a long rally over more than a month through the heart of India, building support for the Ram temple. Modi, then a young and rising party worker in the western state of Gujarat, helped organise the rally.Then, on December 6, 1992, Hindu mobs tore down the Babri Masjid. Ensuing riots across the country killed about 2,000 people.Following years of back and forth in court, the Supreme Court issued its landmark ruling in 2019.The court acknowledged that both the surreptitious manner in which idols were brought into the mosque in 1949 and the demolition in 1949 were crimes. Still, by essentially ordering no consequences for those offences, the court created a scenario where Indian Muslims are “disappointed to see no remorse”, and feel there is little recourse for their concerns, says Apoorvanand.The Ram temple is being built near the banks of the Sarayu River, which runs past Ayodhya and is mentioned in ancient Hindu scriptures. Ayodhya is in India’s northern and most populous state, Uttar Pradesh.Officially known as Shree Ram Janmabhoomi Mandir, it has been constructed in the Nagara style of architecture, which is common in northern India and features tall steeples and a stone platform with steps leading up to the temple.The consecration is scheduled for just after 12pm local time (06:30 GMT) on Monday, January 22.Many of the wings of the temple are still under construction, and some of Hinduism’s foremost seers, the four Shankaracharyas, have objected to the opening, saying that consecrating an incomplete temple goes against Hindu scriptures.Nonetheless, the government, and the trust in charge of the temple, have insisted that the consecration does not violate any tenets of the faith.Monday’s event will include a grand procession of idols to be taken into the building, and a four-foot statue of a child Ram being placed in the inner sanctum. Priests will join Modi for the actual ceremony, expected to last for half an hour.Modi’s government has also planned live screenings of the event across the country. Some Indian embassies have also invited members of the Indian diaspora to screenings.As Hindus across Ayodhya decorate streets and join celebratory rallies, messages are circulating among Muslims to remain at home as a precaution for their safety.The constructed portion of the temple will be open to devotees and the public starting January 23. And as the temple’s doors open to them, so does a path to an economic boost for Ayodhya.About 100 private jets are expected to touch down in Ayodhya ahead of the inauguration and retailers say they have run out of gold and gold-plated statues of Ram.Property prices in Ayodhya have also skyrocketed as the city is set to become a pilgrimage and tourism hotspot.Building the Ram temple at the spot where the Babri Masjid once stood has been one of the BJP’s three foundational promises — the end of Jammu and Kashmir’s semi-autonomous status, which was scrapped in 2019, and a uniform civil code for personal laws are the others.Modi’s consecration of the temple fulfils that decades-long pledge, and comes just weeks before national elections.The Ram temple movement has already paid rich dividends to the BJP’s political fortunes. The party won just two seats out of 543 in the lower house of parliament in 1984. A little more than a decade later, in the first national elections after the Babri Masjid’s demolition, it surged to become India’s single-largest party, winning 161 seats.Its first stint in office lasted just 13 days — because of its association with the mosque demolition, most other parties were unwilling to form alliances that the BJP needed to get to the majority mark of 272 seats in parliament.But as its brand of Hindu nationalism slowly gained acceptability, it came to power again in 1998, and ruled with allies until 2004. After a decade out of power, it stormed back into office under Modi, the most unapologetically Hindu nationalist leader the party has had.On Monday, Modi will look to cement that legacy still further.",Ayodhya Ram Mandir,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/22/why-is-indias-ram-temple-in-ayodhya-controversial,AL JAZEERA,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""framing"", ""reason"": ""The article frames the Ram temple controversy as a complex issue with multiple perspectives, but leans towards presenting the Hindu nationalist viewpoint as the dominant narrative.

163,Tight security in Ayodhya ahead of Babri mosque-Ram temple ruling,"India has barred public gatherings amid tightened security restrictions in the northern Indian town of Ayodhya ahead of a crucial Supreme Court ruling over a disputed site fiercely contested between Hindus and Muslims.India’s top court started hearing final arguments on Monday to decide whether a Hindu temple should be built on the ruins of 16th-century Babri mosque in Ayodhya, a city in Uttar Pradesh state.The razing of Babri mosque by Hindu mobs in 1992 led to one of India‘s deadliest bouts of communal riots, in which at least 2,000 people, most of them Muslim, were killed across the country.Hindu groups believe the site is the birthplace of Lord Ram and have intensified calls for a temple to be built there under Prime Minister Narendra Modi‘s Hindu nationalist government.The Supreme Court is expected to conclude on October 17 hearings into appeals against a key 2010 court ruling that both groups should split the site, with Hindus granted the lion’s share. A verdict is expected before Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi retires on November 17.Here is the order under section 144 issued yesterday. The order has been issued considering safety and security of Ayodhya and those visiting here as Govt’s paramount concerns. Thanks. pic.twitter.com/hyXHJHWJbv— Anuj Kr Jha (@anujias09) October 13, 2019Authorities have imposed an emergency law in Ayodhya under which the public assembly of more than four people is banned, saying “hearings of the case are ongoing and a verdict is likely soon”, the district government said in an order.The restrictions, which were first imposed on August 31, were tightened further on Saturday, Ayodhya’s district magistrate Anuj K Jha said on Sunday.“The order has been issued considering safety and security of Ayodhya and those visiting here as government’s paramount concerns,” Jha tweeted late on Sunday.The new orders said that “drones, unmanned aerial vehicles, unknown flying objects or anything that can be weaponised are banned without prior permission from district authorities”.The district also banned firecrackers popular during this time of the year when Hindus mark several major religious festivals, some involving Hindu deity Ram who they believe was born in Ayodhya.The orders will be in place until December 10, the government said.The dispute in Ayodhya is one of the most polarising issues in a nation where Muslims make up 14 percent of the 1.3 billion population.Hindu and Muslim groups have failed to resolve the dispute through negotiations over the years, and a court decision in 2010 to divide the 2.77-acre (11,210-square metre) site between one Muslim group and two Hindu groups was opposed by both sides.The Supreme Court then took control of the site and has been hearing petitions from both sides over what should be built there. The final hearings will finish this week, with a verdict likely over the next few weeks.At the court in New Delhi, Rajeev Dhavan, a lawyer representing a Muslim group, said the opposition Hindu groups had no evidence to claim ownership of the disputed land.Many Hindus believe the medieval mosque that stood there for 460 years was only built after the destruction of an earlier temple.Modi’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has campaigned on constructing a new temple on the site of the razed mosque.",Ayodhya Ram Mandir,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/10/14/tight-security-in-ayodhya-ahead-of-babri-mosque-ram-temple-ruling,AL JAZEERA,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""framing"", ""reason"": ""The article frames the dispute as a Hindu-Muslim issue, emphasizing the 'Hindu mobs' and 'Muslims' killed in riots, which may promote a particular problem definition."", ""confidence"": 0.8}",yes,framing,"frames the dispute as a Hindu-Muslim issue, emphasizing the 'Hindu mobs' and 'Muslims' killed in riots, which may promote a particular problem definition"
164,Indian PM Modi lays foundation of Ram temple at razed mosque site,"Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi unveiled a plaque on Wednesday to kick off the construction of a Hindu temple in the northern city of Ayodhya on a spot where a mosque was demolished nearly 30 years ago, prompting deadly riots nationwide.Modi offered prayers to nine stone blocks with Lord Ram inscribed on it amid chanting of Hindu religious hymns to symbolise the start of construction of the temple, which is expected to take three and a half years to complete.“I am grateful to witness history being made. Crores [millions] of Indians cannot believe that this day has come. The entire country is in the spell of Lord Ram … Ram is an emblem of India’s unity in diversity,” Modi said in a speech.The Hindu nationalist leader wore a traditional outfit of a gold Kurta, a long shirt, and white Dhoti, a loose cloth wrapped around his waist, along with his face mask.A masked Modi, 69, shared the stage with the head of the RSS, the militaristic Hindu supremacist group that is parent to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and which Modi joined as a young man.“It’s an emotional and historic moment. Wait has been worthwhile,” said Lal Krishna Advani, a 92-year-old leader of the governing BJP who was in the forefront of the party’s temple campaign in the 1990s.Organisers said the ceremony was set on an astrologically auspicious date for Hindus but Wednesday also marked a year since the Modi government revoked the semi-autonomous status of Indian-administered Kashmir – the country’s only Muslim-majority region.The symbolism was impossible to miss since the BJP had long pledged in its manifesto to strip the disputed region of Kashmir of its autonomy and to build a temple to the Hindu God Ram where the Mughal-era mosque once stood.The main roads were barricaded and about 3,000 paramilitary soldiers were guarding Ayodhya city, where all shops and businesses are closed. Last week, a priest and 15 police officers at the temple site tested positive for the coronavirus, which has infected 1.9 million people in India and killed nearly 40,000.“Had this function been held on normal days all these roads would have been chock-a-block with people. Millions of people would have come to Ayodhya to witness this historic event,” temple priest Hari Mohan said.Only 175 religious saints, priests and Hindu and Muslim community representatives were invited to the ceremony.Water from Indian rivers in 2,000 earthen pots sent by various Hindu temples and Sikh shrines was poured at the site.The groundbreaking follows a ruling by India’s Supreme Court last November favouring the building of a Hindu temple on the disputed site in Uttar Pradesh state. Many Hindus believe their God Ram was born at the site and claim Muslim Emperor Babur built a mosque on top of a temple there.The Babri mosque was destroyed by Hindu mobs with pickaxes and crowbars in December 1992, sparking big Hindu-Muslim violence that left some 2,000 people, mostly Muslims, dead. The Supreme Court’s verdict allowed a temple to be built in place of the demolished mosque.Those invited to the groundbreaking ceremony include Iqbal Ansari, the main Muslim litigant in the Supreme Court case, who now supports building the temple in Ayodhya.The court also ordered that Muslims be given two hectares (five acres) of land to build a new mosque at a nearby site.The temple will be about 72 metres (235 feet) wide, 91.5 metres (300 feet) long and 49 metres (161 feet) high with five domes with a total area of about 7,804 square metres (84,000 square feet). The complex will also have a prayer hall, lecture hall, visitors’ hostel and museum.Houses and other buildings close to the temple site in the city of Ayodhya have been painted yellow to recreate the look when the Hindu God Ram ruled there for thousands of years, according to the Hindu epic Ramayana.“Yellow is an auspicious colour. As per Hindu tradition, yellow symbolises purity and light,” temple priest Mahant Kamal Narain Das said.Muslims comprise about 14 percent of Hindu-majority India’s 1.3 billion people. The temple-mosque dispute badly divided Hindus and Muslims, often triggering communal clashes.Prominent Muslims have said the community was resigned to the new reality but fear the new temple could embolden Hindu nationalists to target two other mosques in Uttar Pradesh.“The Modi government should assure Muslims that Hindu outfits will not ask for the construction of temples in Varanasi and Mathura after demolishing existing mosques there,” said Ansari, the main litigant in the Babri mosque case.The Gyanvapi mosque in the city of Varanasi is in a temple complex dedicated to Lord Shiva. In the city of Mathura, the Shahi Idgah mosque stands adjacent to the temple complex that marks the birthplace of the Hindu God Krishna. Hindu organisations say both were built over razed temples.",Ayodhya Ram Mandir,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/8/5/indian-pm-modi-lays-foundation-of-ram-temple-at-razed-mosque-site,AL JAZEERA,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""labeling"", ""reason"": ""Loaded labels/titles applied asymmetrically: 'Hindu nationalist' and 'militaristic Hindu supremacist group' used to describe RSS, while no similar label is applied to the mosque demolition or Muslim community."", ""confidence"": 0.8}",yes,labelling,"labels/titles applied asymmetrically: 'Hindu nationalist' and 'militaristic Hindu supremacist group' used to describe RSS, while no similar label is applied to the mosque demolition or Muslim community."
165,"As Modi launches Ram temple construction, fears of ‘new republic’","Ayodhya, India – For the past week, Indian authorities have been vigorously engaged in giving Ayodhya, a small temple town in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, a quick makeover in advance of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to lay the foundation stone for a temple to Hindu deity Ram.The temple is being built in place of a Mughal-era mosque, which was demolished by a right-wing Hindu mob in 1992, triggering nationwide religious riots in which more than 2,000 people, most of them Muslims, were killed.India’s governing Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) rose to national prominence on the back of the temple movement launched in the 1980s.Many Hindus believe the 16th-century Babri Masjid, named after Mughal emperor Babur (1483-1530), was built at the place where Ram was born in Ayodhya, located about 135km (84 miles) east of the state capital, Lucknow.Last November, a decades-old protracted legal battle between the Hindu and Muslim parties ended with the Supreme Court awarding the contested site to Hindu petitioners, handing the BJP a victory to drive home its Hindu nationalist agenda.The court asked the government to provide Muslims land at a “prominent site” within Ayodhya city limits to build a mosque.With the inauguration of the temple scheduled for August 5 despite concerns due to the coronavirus, Modi’s BJP appears to have fulfilled a long-term promise to its core electorate.The judgement was widely criticised for lacking a sound legal basis as well as signalling a majoritarian push that compromised on India’s secular and democratic constitutional ethics.Ironically, the legal trial in the Babri demolition case is yet to be completed, and justice has eluded those who suffered the loss of life and properties in the nationwide violence that ensued in the wake of the destruction of the mosque – often dubbed the darkest chapter of modern India.Modi’s government has faced both domestic and global criticism for deliberately neglecting its vast Muslim minority, numbering nearly 200 million. The Ayodhya verdict has only cemented this opinion among its opponents and critics.The date chosen for the ceremony also coincides with the first anniversary of the abrogation of the special status of Indian-administered Kashmir, India’s only Muslim majority region that has been the theatre of a bloody armed rebellion for more than 30 years.This aggressive posturing over issues that have dominated the BJP’s politics has raised concerns of Ayodhya-like campaigns in other places with shared Hindu-Muslim heritage and history as well.MR Shamshad, a lawyer who represented Muslim parties in the temple-mosque legal dispute, says “already there are efforts by Hindu groups to ‘reclaim’ other temples that they believe were converted into mosques”.The Vishwa Hindu Parishad, an affiliate of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the parent body of the BJP, has led the movement for the Ram temple since 1984.The trust formed to oversee the construction of the temple is composed mainly of functionaries from the VHP and the RSS, which has propounded supremacy of Hindus in India.At the moment though, the VHP has refrained from taking a clear stand on whether similar campaigns will be launched in the future.“Right now, we are focussed on building a grand Ram temple after 500 years of struggle. Once that is over, our religious leaders and seers will decide what to do about other such places,” VHP’s regional spokesman Sharad Sharma told Al Jazeera.In Ayodhya, a town with a rich and diverse history, the majority Hindu population is happy the Ram temple is being constructed.Shravan Das, a 76-year-old ascetic, says, “Now there would be a flood of development and prosperity. Millions of Hindus will come to worship here and that will be good for everyone here.”Sitting across him, KK Nigam, who owns a shoe shop along the main road of the town, is not so certain about his future because as part of the massive infrastructure development plans, both his house and shop are at the risk of demolition for a four-lane expressway.“I welcome the temple but the government should not destroy our lives for the sake of development. At least 2,000 people will be displaced and their livelihoods ruined if the government goes ahead with its plans,” he says, tearing up.At Makhapur, one of the many villages that surround Ayodhya, there is an air of indifference to the hectic preparations going on in the main town.Bhagelu Maurya, a vegetable vendor, says, “Even if the temple is built I don’t think it will affect my life. Let it get built first, we have seen promises earlier also about development but nothing happened.”A small but significant part of the town’s businesses relies on Muslim craftsmen, milk vendors and flower sellers among others.But since the 1990s, there has been an exodus of Muslim families owing to a threat of violence in the sleepy but sensitive town by the Sarayu River.On the day the Babri mosque was demolished, at least 24 Muslims were killed and scores of houses belonging to the community were torched, triggering the exodus that further reduced their population in Ayodhya.Today, those who survive here are like Abid Khan who makes wooden sandals, mostly for the large number of Hindu ascetics and monks who live here.“I have a Hindu worker who helps me, things in the town are still peaceful. But the fact is we don’t know whom to trust because we have been betrayed earlier in 1992,” says Khan.“More than five generations of my family have lived here but with the cries for creating a Hindu India growing louder, I don’t know how long we can last here.”His business is also going to be disrupted by the development plans but as Muslims elsewhere in India today, Khan’s concerns are more fundamental.At a popular bangle store, the father-son duo of Haji Salim and Abdul Kalim are more circumspect but voice similar concerns. “It would have been much better if the court’s judgement was even-handed,” Kalim told Al Jazeera.“For years now, Muslims have not bought any land in this town. In fact, they have only been selling it and leaving. If things don’t change, we too would have to decide about our future.”Ironically, a fact that is not talked about enough under the BJP rule is that most of Ayodhya’s temples are built on lands donated by Muslim rulers in the 18th and 19th centuries.The town’s scores of mosques, tombs, mausoleums and graveyards are mute testaments to its rich Islamic history and is a symbol of harmonious co-existence between Hindus and Muslims.There has been a marked absence of Islamic places of worship in the nearly $300m development plan for the town.Anil Singh, an Ayodhya-based writer, sees this as part of the Hindu right wing’s scheme to obliterate the town’s syncretic past. “Go a little deeper into Ayodhya and you see so much of Hindu-Muslim heritage,” he says.“Hindus here worship at Sufi shrines like that of Badi Bua who is considered to be the town’s patron saint. But, you won’t hear about her tomb in the government’s plans.”The neglect of Muslims is palpable in the village where the provincial BJP government has allotted land for the mosque under the Supreme Court’s verdict.While the local administration has left no stone unturned to ensure the foundation stone of Ram temple is laid even during a pandemic, it has not shown the same vigour to kick-start the construction of the new mosque. A veritable gloom pervades Dhannipur village.A few residents who spoke to Al Jazeera expressed displeasure that the government had not consulted them before deciding to allocate land for the mosque in their village.“We don’t want any trouble here and the Supreme Court asked the mosque to be built on land inside Ayodhya, not here which is about 20km from there,” Mohammad Zubair told Al Jazeera.Over the last few years, an unprecedented sense of alienation and fear has gripped India’s minorities, particularly the Muslims.“The BJP has been reorganising the Indian polity as an authoritarian Hindu nationalist state. Politically, three events – the Ayodhya verdict, revocation of Kashmir’s special status and statehood, and the Citizenship Amendment Act – challenged the core foundations of the Indian republic,” political scientist Zoya Hasan told Al Jazeera.“The ceremony in Ayodhya openly involving state machinery is a sobering moment, marking the dismantling of the original republic and a signpost of the commencement of a new republic.”",Ayodhya Ram Mandir,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/8/5/as-modi-launches-ram-temple-construction-fears-of-new-republic,AL JAZEERA,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""framing"", ""reason"": ""The article frames the Ayodhya Ram Mandir construction as a symbol of Hindu nationalism and a threat to India's secular democracy, using loaded language such as 'majoritarian push', 'dismantling of the original republic'"", ""confidence"": 0.8}",yes,framing,"frames the Ayodhya Ram Mandir construction as a symbol of Hindu nationalism and a threat to India's secular democracy, using loaded language such as 'majoritarian push', 'dismantling of the original republic'"
166,"After Ayodhya, another mosque-temple dispute brews in India’s UP","New Delhi, India – A court in India’s Uttar Pradesh state has passed an order related to a dispute over a centuries-old mosque and a temple situated next to each other – a case reminiscent of a similar and bloody dispute in another temple town, controversially resolved in 2019.The court in Varanasi town on Thursday directed the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) to find out whether the centuries-old Gyanvapi Mosque “standing at present at the ‘disputed site’ is a superimposition, alteration or addition, or there is a structural overlapping of any kind, with or over, any other religious structure”, effectively meaning the adjacent Kashi Vishwanath Temple.The court’s decision followed petitions filed by right-wing Hindu groups which claimed that Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb demolished a portion of the temple to build the mosque in the 17th century.The court ordered a five-member committee, comprising two Hindus, two Muslims and an archaeological expert, to oversee the “comprehensive physical survey”, setting May 31 as the date for the next hearing.Varanasi is the parliamentary constituency of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, whose Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) came to prominence as a political force in the 1980s through a movement to build a Ram temple in Ayodhya, 228km (141 miles) away, in the same state.In 1992, a mob demolished the Babri Mosque, which Hindu groups claimed was built by a general of Babur, the founder of the Mughal dynasty in the Indian subcontinent, on the exact site where Lord Ram was born.The demolition of the mosque triggered deadly religious riots across India, killing more than 2,000 people, and according to historians, permanently rupturing India’s social fabric.In November 2019, in a widely criticised order, India’s Supreme Court handed over the disputed site in Ayodhya to Hindu claimants and allowed the construction of a Ram temple under the government’s supervision. The top court gave the verdict despite ruling that there was no evidence to support the allegation that the mosque was built after destroying a Ram temple.In August last year, while the COVID-19 pandemic raged across India, Modi flew down to Ayodhya with a delegation of senior BJP politicians and performed the ground-breaking ceremony for the new temple, planned to be inaugurated before the 2024 national elections.In Varanasi too, Modi’s government is overseeing the construction of a huge project to showcase the Vishwanath Temple, which has led to the demolition of centuries-old smaller temples and other structures in the oldest parts of the city.Like Ayodhya, the dispute in Varanasi is also decades old and first reached the court in 1991, when Hindu priests sought permission to worship in the Gyanvapi Mosque area.The dispute forced the then federal government to pass the Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act, 1991 which prevented the conflagration of religious disputes similar to the Babri Mosque-Ram Temple issue. The law prohibited the alteration of all religious places as they existed on August 15 1947 – the day India gained independence from British rule.Thursday’s order by the Varanasi court violates that law, which, in a controversial move, the Supreme Court last month agreed to review.“We also want the status to remain the same but we want the court to decide whether it is a mosque or a temple,” Vijay Shankar Rastogi, the lawyer who filed the petition for the Hindu parties in the Varanasi matter, told Al Jazeera.Mosque-temple disputes have been central to the Hindu supremacist politics in India. Far-right Hindu groups such as the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) have for long demanded the “liberation” of temples across the country.“The court order paves the way for the truth to come out and everybody should welcome it. Even if this order comes after 30 years, at least it shows the way for the liberation of the temple,” VHP spokesman Vinod Bansal told Al Jazeera.Muslim parties said they will approach the Allahabad High Court to challenge the Varanasi court’s order.“Our understanding is clear that this case is barred by the Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act, 1991. Even in the Ayodhya judgement, the ASI excavation was ultimately of no use. The ASI did not find proof that the Babri Masjid was built upon demolition of a temple,” Zufar Ahmad Faruqi, chairman of the Sunni Central Waqf Board of Uttar Pradesh, told Al Jazeera.“This practice of mosques being ‘investigated’ by the ASI has to be stopped.”Political scientist Zoya Hasan thinks the dormant dispute seems to be unfolding in a systemic manner.“We need to remember that recently the Supreme Court has admitted a petition challenging the validity of the Places of Worship Act, 1991. And now comes this order which is a clear violation of existing legislation,” she told Al Jazeera.“For the BJP, such issues have always proven to be beneficial for mobilisation of Hindus. If this order is not dismissed by a higher court, it is likely to lead to religious polarisation like we saw in the Ayodhya dispute.”",Ayodhya Ram Mandir,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/4/9/after-ayodhya-another-mosque-temple-dispute-brews-in-indias-up,AL JAZEERA,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""tonality"", ""reason"": ""Loaded language used to describe Hindu groups as 'far-right' and 'Hindu supremacist', while Muslim parties are described as having a 'clear understanding'."", ""confidence"": 0.8}",yes,tonality,"language used to describe Hindu groups as 'far-right' and 'Hindu supremacist', while Muslim parties are described as having a 'clear understanding'"
167,"As Hindus rejoice, Muslim reaction mixed over Ayodhya verdict","Ayodhya, Uttar Pradesh, India – There was heightened security in Ayodhya, a town in north India, ahead of the Supreme Court’s verdict on a site claimed by both Muslims and Hindus.Early on Saturday, the town looked deserted as residents stayed inside their homes, waiting for the decision to be announced.Some had even stocked up on food in advance, just in case the decision provoked anger, violence and eventually a curfew in this historic town.But when India’s top court delivered its verdict, Hindu-majority Ayodhya slowly went back to normal, with people back in the streets.A heavy police presence did not deter locals from venturing out and expressing their happiness or reservations about the landmark judgement.In a verdict that disappointed Muslims, the court awarded Hindus control of the site, paving the way for the construction of a temple.A 16th-century mosque, known as Babri Masjid, had been at the site until December 6, 1992, when it was destroyed by Hindu mobs. The country later witnessed some of the deadliest religious riots since independence, in which thousands of mostly Muslim Indians were killed.Hindus believe that Lord Ram, the warrior god, was born at the site in Ayodhya and claim that the first Mughal emperor Babur built the mosque on top of a temple there.On Saturday, five judges led by Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi also directed the Indian government to allot five acres (two hectares) of land to Muslims to build a mosque, and acknowledged that the demolition in 1992 violated the rule of the law.The Supreme Court directed the government to form a committee within three months to lead the construction of the temple.Hindus in Ayodhya hailed the judgement, saying it respected the interests of both Hindus and Muslims.Some congratulated each other on the streets as others chanted “Jai Shree Ram” (Hail Lord Ram), a religious slogan that was politicised in the early 1990s during the Ram Temple Movement, which led to the demolition of Babri Mosque.“It is a historic day for all Hindus across the world and I am really proud at how the Supreme Court handled the entire issue. There couldn’t have been a better judgement than this,” Bharat Das, a Hindu priest at a temple in Ayodhya, told Al Jazeera.“I even welcome the decision by the court to provide alternate land to Muslims. This verdict will strengthen the bond between the Hindus and the Muslims in the country.”Rajendra Tiwari, who owns a small shop in the town, welcomed the judgement for economic reasons.“If a huge Ram temple is built in Ayodhya, it will boost the local economy as more tourists would flock to the town,” he said. “This would mean better business opportunities for people like me.“The economy of Ayodhya is totally dependent on Ram and if there are no tourists, we will have nothing to eat.“Even Muslims can’t deny that fact. The people of this town, irrespective of their religion, should prosper and this decision has done that.”Reactions among the Muslim community in Ayodhya were mixed.Some welcomed the decision, others rejected it, and there was a feeling of resignation – that Muslims had no choice but to accept the court’s decision.There was also a sense of relief, that the outcome ends a dispute that had become the biggest fault line between the two communities in India.“We want closure and the Supreme Court has shown us the way. We have no issues if it [the temple] is built there but we would have been happier if the court had specified the place where the mosque would be built,” said Babu Bhai, a member of the Babri Mosque Citizen Resolution Committee.Akram Khan, a resident, welcomed the decision: “Senior members of our community, who were also part of the negotiations, have already said that they respect and welcome the court judgement, so there is no reason why we should differ.“Our five generations have witnessed so much hostility because of this dispute and if this is how the court feels it should be addressed, we welcome it.”Meanwhile, the All India Muslim Personal Law Board said that it was not satisfied as it promised to evaluate legal options, including filing a review petition.Critics of the decision were vocal on social media, with some saying the verdict was a faith-based decision.Kapil Komireddi, an Indian author and journalist, wrote on Twitter: “What happened today is not the end of a distressing chapter in our history. It is the beginning of a calamitous phase. What they did in Ayodhya they will seek to replicate in a dozen other places. And the horror of Ayodhya will seem trivial as they go about avenging history.”Writer Rana Ayyub said: “The privileged who did not suffer through the anti-Muslim carnage post the Babri demolition in 1992 are talking about closure. Closure for whom?”International lawyer Suchitra Vijayan wrote on Twitter: “The Hindu Rashtra [Hindu polity] is here & this is the beginning of an epoch of fear. In the years to come Ayodhya, & Gujarat pogrom will pale in comparison. We will remember the men who were meant to defend our constitution, abdicate their responsibility to truth & justice.”Several people said they agreed with the arguments of law professor Faizan Mustafa.In the Huffington Post on Saturday, Mustafa said: “It looks like the Supreme Court gave importance to belief over other concerns. The court, even while observing that faith is limited to individual believer and that it cannot determine a land dispute, eventually gave the disputed land for the construction of a Hindu temple.“This means that belief of a section of people was given prominence over the rule of law even though the latter should have ideally determined a property dispute.”Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the verdict should not be seen as a victory or loss for anybody.“The calm and peace maintained by [1.3 billion] Indians in the run-up to today’s verdict manifests India’s inherent commitment to peaceful coexistence,” Modi said. “May this very spirit of unity and togetherness power the development trajectory of our nation. May every Indian be empowered.”Opposition parties welcomed the court’s decision and called for peace and harmony in the country.However, there was some backlash from opposition politician Asaduddin Owaisi, the president of All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen.“If the Babri Masjid wasn’t demolished that day, what would the judgement have been today?” he said. “There has been discrimination against Muslims and no one can deny it. We are fighting for our legal rights.”He dismissed the promise of an alternative plot of land for Muslims, saying he feared that other mosques in the country could see Hindu nationalists making similar claims.Valay Singh, the author of Ayodhya: City of Faith, City of Discord, described the verdict as a “landmark judgement”.“What is even more interesting is how not even one judge dissented,” he told Al Jazeera, “which says a lot about the times that we live in”.",Ayodhya Ram Mandir,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/11/9/as-hindus-rejoice-muslim-reaction-mixed-over-ayodhya-verdict,AL JAZEERA,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""tonality"", ""reason"": ""The article presents a balanced view of the reactions from both Hindu and Muslim communities, but some quotes from critics of the decision have a more negative and alarmist tone, such as Kapil Komireddi's tweet saying it"", ""confidence"": 0.8}",yes,tonality,some quotes from critics of the decision have a more negative and alarmist tone
168,Indian town anxiously awaits landmark Babri mosque-temple verdict,"Ayodhya, India – Ayodhya and its twin city, Faizabad, in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh (UP) are in a state of heightened anxiety as they await the verdict of the country’s top court in a 70-year-old legal dispute over land Muslims and Hindus both claim as theirs.The Supreme Court, which concluded its hearings in the case last month, will decide by mid-November whether a Hindu temple should be built in place of the medieval-era Babri mosque, which was demolished by Hindu mobs in 1992.Hindu groups claim the site was where their deity, Lord Ram, was born, while Muslims say they prayed at the mosque for generations until 1949 when an idol of Ram was surreptitiously placed inside the mosque.Thousands of security personnel have been deployed to prevent the outbreak of violence. Hotel rooms have been booked for senior officers even as locals, apprehensive of the fallout of the verdict, have started to postpone marriages, religious functions and other celebrations.While Hindus in this temple town expect the top court to rule in their favour, the minority Muslim community remains hopeful that the verdict will vindicate their claims.“This time we won’t be caught by surprise like in 1992,” said Naim Ashrafi, 60, looking at the Ayodhya skyline dominated by spires of temples.Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) rose to political prominence in the early 1990s on the back of the Ram temple movement that culminated in the demolition of the mosque.Modi had promised to build the temple during the general elections campaigning earlier this year.The court has to decide who owns the land on which the mosque stood, among other issues, which are entangled in faith and sentiment, history and myth.The demolition of the mosque built under the rule of Mughal emperor Babur sparked India’s worst Hindu-Muslim violence, which left about 2,000 people dead, mostly Muslims.In Ayodhya, which was until then a quiet pilgrim town, at least a dozen Muslims were killed.Ashrafi survived the 1992 violence by hiding in marigold fields while rioters went on the rampage despite the presence of security forces.Though senior BJP leaders, including former Deputy Prime Minister Lal Krishna Advani, have been charged in connection with the demolition of the mosque, the criminal trial has dragged on for years.Baba Hazarilal came to Ayodhya as a young man in the 1980s and was a part of the mob that brought down the mosque.“With BJP governments at the centre as well as in Uttar Pradesh, I am sure our dream of a Ram temple will be realised,” Hazarilal, now in his 60s, says. “The court must respect Hindu sentiment and clear the way for a temple.”As the deadline draws nearer, most people, particularly the youth in Ayodhya, hope for a resolution so their town can move on.“I believe that local Hindus are not the problem. I have many Hindu friends, we live here comfortably, the problem is those outsiders who come here to create trouble,” Sufiyana Ali, a 19-year-old aspiring photographer, told Al Jazeera.A short distance from Ali’s house, folk dance instructor Mukesh Kumar, 26, was busy rehearsing with his group that works to preserve local folk dance and music.“I don’t want to speculate on the case, these are the best legal minds, let them decide what is to be done. But it is an opportunity to bring a final closure to the dispute, so I hope that the judgement is balanced,” Kumar said.Ali and Kumar represent a new generation who were born after the mosque demolition and subsequent violence. Unburdened by Ayodha’s troubled history, they dream of better opportunities to fulfil their aspirations.In 2010, the Allahabad High Court had ruled that the disputed area of 2.77 acres (11,210 square metres) be divided into three equal parts, with two-thirds going to the Hindu community and one-third to the Sunni Muslim Waqf Board, which represents Muslims in the court.The judgement was challenged by all the parties in the Supreme Court.The BJP pushed for the temple within constitutional boundaries while many right-wing Hindu organisations, some linked to the ruling party, wanted it settled out of court.Earlier this year, the Supreme Court appointed an arbitration panel to mediate in the case but it failed to arrive at a settlement.Meanwhile, right-wing Hindu leaders have continued to issue rhetorical statements claiming the site as theirs.A Hindu godman-turned politician, Ram Vilas Vedanti, recently announced that construction of the temple would start on December 6, the anniversary of the Babri mosque demolition – a day Muslims mark as “Yaum-e-Gham”, or day of mourning, and right-wing Hindu groups celebrate as “Shaurya Diwas”, or victory day.Such assertions have stoked fears among the Muslim community. Many of them admit that the construction of the temple is the only “practical” solution.“Given the politics of the country, I feel that it is better for us to accept that even if we win the case we will never be able to build a mosque there,” said Salman, a 40-year-old who drives mainly Hindu pilgrims around Ayodhya in his electric vehicle.Prime Minister Modi, in his recent weekly radio broadcast, however, seemed to call on members of civil society and religious leaders to exercise restraint.Modi’s emphasis on peace and restraint, however, has not stopped leaders from his party and BJP’s other sister Hindu organisations from making provocative statements.UP Chief Minister Yogi Aditynath, a Hindu monk known for his anti-Muslim rhetoric, has unabashedly called for the building of the temple despite holding a public position in an officially secular nation of 1.3 billion people.Since his surprise elevation as chief minister in 2017, he has changed names of cities and landmarks bearing Muslim names and promoted Hindu pilgrimage centres, including Ayodhya.In 2018, he renamed Faizabad district to Ayodhya and announced the construction of a giant statue of Ram in town. Ayodhya was earlier part of Faizabad district.During the recent celebrations of the Hindu festival of Diwali, the BJP government pulled out all stops to fund a three-day festival that culminated in the lighting up of more than 550,000 earthen lamps.Dozens of wall-sized TV screens mounted on trucks broadcast a popular 1980s TV show based on the epic Ramayana across Ayodhya and surrounding towns and villages.Public announcements in the pilgrim town promised the beginning of Ram Rajya (glorified as an ideal government in Hindu folklore) and urged people to gather in large numbers in Ayodhya.“I have been a regular visitor to Ayodhya’s temples but never before I have seen a government trying so hard to revive the glory of this ancient town,” said 35-year-old Gopal Das.Far from this religious-political hustle-bustle of the main street, in a small mosque atop one of the many knolls that dot Ayodhya, 71-year-old Maulana Yasin hobbled up and seated himself on a plastic chair.“There is a sense of deja vu. Though things are peaceful at the moment, we are ready to rush our women and children to safer places if we sense any trouble,” he said.Yasin had watched his brother Ameen being killed and then set on fire in 1992.“None of those who attacked him were locals. It is the outsiders who come here to stoke communal fires across the country for political gains.“I have faith in the judiciary, but whatever be the verdict, it must also ensure that nobody is allowed to disturb the harmony here. I only wish to see this dispute settled so I can die in peace.”",Ayodhya Ram Mandir,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/11/7/indian-town-anxiously-awaits-landmark-babri-mosque-temple-verdict,AL JAZEERA,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""tonality"", ""reason"": ""The article presents a balanced view of the situation, but some phrases and quotes suggest a slightly sympathetic tone towards the Muslim community, such as 'the minority Muslim community remains hopeful that the verdict"", ""confidence"": 0.6}",yes,tonality,"some phrases and quotes suggest a slightly sympathetic tone towards the Muslim community, such as 'the minority Muslim community remains hopeful "
169,Thousands gather in New Delhi to push for Hindu temple in Ayodhya,"Tens of thousands of hardline Hindu protesters have marched in India’s capital city, calling for a grand temple to be built on the ruins of a 16th-century mosque destroyed by a mob 26 years ago.The protesters, along with dozens of Hindu monks, gathered in New Delhi on Sunday under the banner of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP or World Hindu Council) and similar groups linked to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).Trident-waving devotees clad in saffron filled the sprawling Ramlila Maidan grounds under tight security, warning Modi that they would not let up until the temple was sanctioned.Causing a frenzy in a crowd of more than 200,000 people, Hindu monks made a series of fiery speeches laced with religious overtones as demonstrators chanted “Praise be to Ram”.Some of Modi’s supporters feel he has not done enough to raise a shrine at a site in Ayodhya, a small town believed to be the birthplace of the deity Ram in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh.The site in Ayodhya was home to a medieval mosque for 460 years until a Hindu mob tore it down in 1992, kicking off riots across India that left thousands dead, most of them Muslim.The BJP was on the margins until the 1980s when its top leaders, including Modi, backed a growing movement for the construction of the Ram temple.After the demolition of the mosque, both Hindu and Muslim groups petitioned the Supreme Court to help resolve the issue. The top court has sought more time to give its verdict.But Hindu hardliners want Modi, who is seeking re-election in 2019, to push parliament to guarantee the temple through an executive order, bypassing the Supreme Court.“We don’t care about the courts. A grand temple will be constructed in 2019,” Sushil Chawdhary, a VHP leader, told AFP news agency.The dispute remains at the core of tensions between the Hindu majority and India’s minority Muslims, who constitute 14 percent of the country’s 1.3 billion people.While the VHP was the organiser for the Sunday protest, a number of leaders from the BJP and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the ruling party’s far-right ideological mentor, addressed the crowds.“I’ve come here to attend the religious congregation as a Hindu woman, not as a politician, as I believe that the issue of Ram temple is linked with the faith of India’s 80 percent people,” said Meenakashi Lekhi, a BJP legislator representing New Delhi in parliament.“The gathering here is telling you that Hindus won’t sit back until the temple is built, and our wishes are respected,” VHP leader Champat Rai told Reuters news agency.Some carried maces and tridents – weapons traditionally wielded by Hindu gods – and travelled great distances by train and bus to reach the rally.“We have come here to protect our religion and Hindu pride. We want a temple for our Lord Ram,” Hitesh Bharadwaj, a teacher from New Delhi’s satellite city, Noida, told AFP.The VHP has applied pressure on Modi in recent weeks, staging a huge show of force in Ayodhya itself last month, and planning more such protests in the coming months.In the run-up to the general election due within six months, the BJP and other Hindu groups have ratcheted up their demand for a new temple at the disputed site.Most analysts expect Modi’s BJP to fare worse than it did in the 2014 election, and critics often accuse the party of using communal issues to whip up support.For the past three decades, the BJP and Hindu outfits associated with it have resurrected the Ayodhya controversy before elections, stoking tensions between the Hindus and Muslims.",Ayodhya Ram Mandir,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/12/9/thousands-gather-in-new-delhi-to-push-for-hindu-temple-in-ayodhya,AL JAZEERA,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""framing"", ""reason"": ""The article frames the protesters as 'hardline Hindu' and emphasizes their demands for a temple, while describing the mosque's demolition as an action by a 'Hindu mob'.

170,The BJP’s rise to political eminence lies in an old temple town,"Ayodhya, Uttar Pradesh – Bookseller Kailash Chandra Das says he cannot wait any longer for a Ram temple to be built in Ayodhya, a temple town considered by India’s Hindus as the birthplace of their most prominent deity.“How long will we continue to be assured that it will be built,” the 65-year-old asks, his voice betraying a hint of disdain, as he squats between piles of Hindu scriptures and books in his cramped shop.“How long should Hindus wait?” he says, echoing what millions of Hindus have been asking since 1992, when Babri Masjid, a 16th-century Mughal-era mosque, was demolished by a Hindu nationalist mob.The event made the north Indian town with roughly 50,000 people the epicentre of Hindutva (the Hindu supremacist ideology) politics professed by the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).The BJP came to national prominence in the 1990s after it led a nationwide movement to build a temple in place of the mosque.Located on the banks of river Saryu, nearly 150km east of Lucknow, the capital of Uttar Pradesh state, Ayodhya is a dense maze of hundreds of temples attracting hundreds of thousands of pilgrims every year.Many Hindus believe the Babri mosque was originally constructed by the Muslim Mughal rulers after they had destroyed a temple.On December 6, 1992, it was demolished in a day Hindu far-right leaders celebrate as “Shaurya Diwas” (day of bravery). A makeshift shrine was built on the debris of the mosque a day later.The incident triggered countrywide religious riots that killed around 2,000 people, mostly Muslims.India’s Supreme Court is currently hearing claims from both Hindus and Muslims on the plot of land – the country’s most disputed real estate – guarded by armed soldiers, while a metal wall painted in blue surrounds the site.On a warm April day, tens of thousands of pilgrims streamed into Ayodhya for the Ram Navami celebrations, a Hindu festival that marks Ram’s birth, throwing the town’s traffic in chaos.Police were busy regulating the entry of devotees making their way on foot into the holy town with numerous temples, small and big, new and historical, decorated with blue and white balloons.A line of thousands of men, women and children, predominantly poor, stretched along a dusty road partitioned by bamboo poles, as they carried their offerings for the gods in small bags.For 50-year-old farmer Daya Ram, however, the Ayodhya issue is far more complicated. “Has the Ram temple been made despite so many promises? Leaders are only concerned about money and power.”Daya Ram says he is “unhappy” with his town being politicised and known globally for the controversy. “Will a Ram temple give me food? Or education for my children?” he asks.As he talks, a group of devotees shouts “Jai Shri Ram” (Hail Lord Ram). Daya Ram smiles but does not join the chorus.The Hindu nationalist BJP was founded in 1980, but it actually emerged from the Bharatiya Jan Sangh party formed in 1951.I consider the entire Ayodhya as Ram's birthplace. Why fight over one spot?by Iqbal Ansari, son of the main litigant in Babri mosque disputeFor nearly three decades, the BJP has campaigned for a “bhavya” (grand) Ram temple in Ayodhya, a populist platform that catapulted the right-wing party from two parliamentary seats in the 1980s to political dominance.“They carefully chose Ram as their deity, because he appeals to a large section of Hindu society. Ram is venerated by every sect of Hinduism. So the movement for the liberation of Ram’s birthplace became both a political and a religious movement,” journalist Dhirendra K Jha, who co-authored the book, Ayodhya: The Long Night, told Al Jazeera.Not far from the disputed site is a large compound, Karsevak Puram, where thousands of bricks with “Ram” emblazoned on them and hundreds of sandstone pillars have been lying scattered for years, their red edges now blackened, while artisans continue to create more for the proposed temple.For Jha, the 1990 Ram Rath Yatra (chariot procession) – originally scheduled from Somnath in Gujarat to Ayodhya after crisscrossing India’s ‘Hindi belt’ (Hindi-speaking north Indian states) – “crystallised the Hindu majoritarian politics in India”.Aimed at mobilising the Hindus for a Ram temple in Ayodhya, the Rath Yatra rally was led by LK Advani, now a 91-year-old BJP veteran, who counted the incumbent Prime Minister Narendra Modi as one of his closest lieutenants during the controversial journey.The Hindu nationalist party denies it has used the Ayodhya dispute to gain political power.“It is not a question of any issue helping the BJP. Ayodhya is a matter concerning the faith of millions of Hindus of this country. And it is not an electoral issue for the BJP,” the party’s spokesperson GVL Narasimha Rao told Al Jazeera.“How many times have you heard the prime minister or Amit Shah [BJP president] talk about Ram temple?”But analysts such as Jha say the party engages in “doublespeak” when it comes to communally-sensitive issues.“The BJP works on two plains. One that comes out in speeches, statements, in which they are not saying much about what is called their core issues. On another plain, they are actually using [the] Ayodhya issue in a pretty intense manner,” said Jha.“So, whether they speak or not, communalism continues to remain a part of the total discourse that BJP uses for an election, sometimes brazenly, often subtly.”Muslims in Ayodhya say while everything changed on December 6, 1992, tensions had simmered for decades.How long should Hindus wait?by Kailash Chandra Das, a bookseller in AyodhyaIqbal Ansari lives right behind the blue barricades that surround the disputed Babri mosque compound. His father Hashim Ansari, one of the chief litigants in the Ayodhya dispute, died in 2016.“My father had been a petitioner since an idol of Ram was placed in the mosque in 1949,” he told Al Jazeera as he sat in his modest drawing room, flanked by a security guard provided by the government.“It would not have turned into such a huge dispute if only the idol was removed, nor it would have been politicised like this.”Iqbal says there was no religious dispute in Ayodhya before 1949. “Why would there be a dispute? I consider the entire Ayodhya as Ram’s birthplace. Why fight over one spot?”Mohammad Afzal Khan, activist and resident of Faizabad, said: “We cannot ever forget the day” the mosque was destroyed.“The Uttar Pradesh government had assured the Supreme Court that no damage would be done to the mosque. So in the heart of our hearts, we were sure that it will not be harmed,” Khan told Al Jazeera.“The Ram idol that was placed in 1949 was also destroyed,” he said, adding that the mob then turned towards the Muslim areas, killing over a dozen people and burning houses and mosques along the way.The Ayodhya dispute has created a deep fissure in Hindu-Muslim relations, with India’s politics increasingly polarised on religious issues.But for millions of BJP supporters, such as bookseller Das, there is nothing wrong with mixing religion with politics. “Can there be any politics without religion,” he said.",Ayodhya Ram Mandir,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/5/1/the-bjps-rise-to-political-eminence-lies-in-an-old-temple-town,AL JAZEERA,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""framing"", ""reason"": ""The article frames the Ayodhya dispute as a Hindu nationalist issue, emphasizing the BJP's role in promoting Hindutva and the Ram temple movement.

171,Ayodhya verdict: Indian top court gives disputed site to Hindus,"India’s Supreme Court has awarded Hindus control of a disputed religious site in the town of Ayodhya for the construction of a temple, in a landmark verdict announced amid heightened security across the country.Muslims will be given five acres of land at an alternative site in Ayodhya, in northern Uttar Pradesh state, the top court ruled on Saturday.In a unanimous decision over the site claimed by both Hindus and Muslims, the five-judge bench asked the government to set up a trust that will construct a temple for Hindu deity Ram.“The judgement is not satisfactory but we respect it. We will have discussions and then decide further course of action,” Zafaryab Jilani, Sunni Waqf Board lawyer, was quoted as saying by NDTV news channel.Faizan Mustafa, vice-chancellor of NALSAR University of Law, Hyderabad, termed the verdict “controversial”.“The judges tried their best to have a kind of a balance but ultimately it’s the mystery of the faith over rule of law, because they [judges] said that we can’t be doing anything about the Hindu belief and if they believe that Ram was born here … we have to accept it,” he said.“Belief is good for the purposes of religion, but can it become a basis to resolve property disputes?”Al Jazeera’s Anchal Vohra, reporting from New Delhi, said a board of trustees [appointed by the government] would be formed in three months to essentially decide how to go about the construction of the temple.She added the alternative site for Muslims would be decided by the central government or the state government.“Muslim intellectuals had already offered this when the mediations took place early this year as a possible solution to have broader peace between the two communities,” Vohra said.Prime Minister Narendra Modi hailed the verdict, saying it had “amicably” ended the decades-old dispute.“The halls of justice have amicably concluded a matter going on for decades. Every side, every point of view was given adequate time and opportunity to express differing points of view. This verdict will further increase people’s faith in judicial processes,” Modi tweeted.Hardliners among India’s majority Hindus, including supporters of Modi’s Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), believe that Lord Ram, the warrior god, was born at the site where the Babri mosque existed. They say that the first Mughal emperor Babur built Babri Mosque on top of a temple at the site.Muslims said they prayed at the mosque for generations until 1949, when Hindu activists placed idols of Ram.The 460-year-old mosque was demolished in 1992 by Hindu mobs triggering nationwide religious violence that left about 2,000 people dead, most of them Muslims.Muslim-majority Pakistan, India’s rival neighbour, responded to the decision on Saturday.“This decision has shredded the veneer of so-called secularism of India by making clear that minorities in India are no longer safe; they have to fear for their beliefs and for their places of worship,” the foreign office in Islamabad said in a statement.“The Indian government should ensure the protection of Muslims, their lives, rights and properties and avoid being yet again a silent spectator of Muslims becoming the victims of Hindu extremists and zealots.“The international community, the United Nations and other human rights organisations in particular should play their role by restraining India from its pursuit of an extremist ideology.”The streets of Ayodhya wore a deserted look with very few businesses operating.At some places, people were seen raising slogans of Jai Shree Ram (Hail Lord Ram) and congratulating each other.Most Hindus celebrated the court’s decision while Muslims hoped that Ayodhya would remain peaceful. In 1992, dozens of Ayodhya Muslims were killed in the wake of violence.“The Hindus of India have for so long wanted a temple at the place where Ram was born,” Rajesh Kumar said.December 6, 1992 and November 9, 2019, will be remembered as days of death of secularism in India.by Nabiya Khan, a studentPappu Singh, of the neighbouring state of Bihar, said the verdict was a victory for the entire nation.“I have been waiting for this moment for several years. Finally, the courts have heard my plea and this nothing less than a miracle.“With this verdict, the court has given a new life to Ram. The court has ensured that both the parties got something.Muslims in the Hindu holy town, however, expressed disappointment at the verdict.“The court has not specified where it would give the land for the mosque. If the court would have specified it, Muslims would have been pleased,” said Mohammed Shibu Khan from the Syed Bada area of Ayodhya.“However, I am happy that this has come to an end as the people of Ayodhya are tired of frequent shutdowns throughout the year.”In the Muslim-majority area of Jamia Nagar in the capital New Delhi, people said they did not get justice.“[That] the Hindu mob which demolished Babri Masjid went unpunished only proves India’s incompetence as a democracy,” Nabiya Khan, a student, told Al Jazeera.“December 6, 1992 and November 9, 2019, will be remembered as days of death of secularism in India.”Mohammad Mussa, 58, of Zakir Nagar, said the mosque on the site belonged to Muslims.“Whatever the judgement is, we should accept it because we live in an India run by the right-wing BJP which thinks this country belongs to Hindus only. Muslims should stay calm and not react to anything because there are forces who want bloodshed in the country.”The Supreme Court on Saturday said a structure existed under the Babri Mosque, which was not built on vacant land.A 2010 lower court ruling had divided the disputed 2.77 acres (1.12 hectares) into three equal parts, with two-thirds going to the Hindu community and one-third to Muslims.

172,Indian Muslim trust to start Ayodhya mosque project on January 26,"A Muslim group in India says it will start the construction of a mosque in the northern Indian city of Ayodhya on January 26, the day the South Asian nation celebrates its Republic Day.The project is a part of the settlement of a case surrounding the demolition of the Babri Mosque by a Hindu mob in 1992, leading to some of the worst religious violence India has witnessed, killing more than 2,000 people, and a protracted legal battle in various courts.Right-wing groups, including the governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), claimed Mughal Emperor Babur built the mosque in the 16th century at the exact site where Hindu god Lord Ram was born.In November 2019, India’s Supreme Court handed over the site to a Hindu trust for the construction of a Ram temple, while the government-controlled Sunni Central Waqf Board was given an alternate site 25km (15 miles) away to build a mosque.Subsequently, the board announced the formation of the Indo-Islamic Cultural Foundation (IICF) trust to execute the mosque’s construction.Today at the Press Conference of Trust members and Architect Prof S M Akhtar, the design of the Mosque and Hospital was unveiled. @athardesi @FaruqiZufar #ayodhyamosque pic.twitter.com/Iy4vn6SLVI— INDO-ISLAMIC CULTURAL FOUNDATION (@IndoIslamicCF) December 19, 2020According to a statement issued late on Sunday, the IICF trust said work on the mosque will formally begin on January 26, India’s Republic Day, which marks the day India’s constitution came into effect in 1950.The trust said the national flag will be hoisted on the five-acre plot of the so-called Dhannipur Mosque Project at 8:30am (03:00 GMT), followed by a tree-planting.“It was decided that the Indo-Islamic Cultural Foundation will be celebrating the Republic Day of India this year with the start of the Dhannipur Mosque Project, which includes a hospital, museum, library, community kitchen, Indo-Islamic Cultural Research Center, a publication house and a mosque,” IICF secretary Athar Hussain said in the statement.“The formal start of the project should be by plantation of tree saplings on five acres of land. As envisaged in the project, a green area, which will have plants from all over the world – from the Amazon rainforest to areas having bushfires in Australia – and from all different geographical regions of India will be developed to create awareness on the imminent threat of climate change,” the statement added.Meanwhile, a campaign has been launched by Hindu groups to collect funds for the Ram temple in Ayodhya.Indian media reports last week said President Ram Nath Kovind donated 500,001 rupees ($6,823), triggering criticism by Muslim groups and activists over the move in an officially secular nation.Many other BJP leaders have also contributed, with the Hindu trust saying it will also reach out to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and other government officials for the funds.Meanwhile, Indian media reports said nearly $13m has been collected by the trust, which said it aims to build the temple before 2024 – the year the next general elections are due.Local media has also reported religious tensions in several places as the drive to collect funds for the temple is carried out across the country, with Hindu right-wing groups accused of raising inflammatory slogans and harassing Muslims.",Ayodhya Ram Mandir,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/1/18/indian-muslim-trust-to-start-ayodhya-mosque-project-on-january-26,AL JAZEERA,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""selection"", ""reason"": ""The article focuses on the Muslim group's plan to build a mosque in Ayodhya, while devoting more space to Hindu groups' efforts to collect funds for the Ram temple.

173,Hindu BJP stokes Ayodhya mosque row,"Deputy Prime Minister Lal Krishna Advani, on a nationwide election campaign, told a public meeting late on Monday that a temple to Hindu god-king Ram would be built after elections which the Bharatiya Janata Party-led coalition is expected to win.The promise was a dramatic departure from the BJP’s bid to get re-elected in this month’s polls on a platform of development and growth in the northern town of Ayodhya, a flashpoint of tensions between Hindus and Muslims.“I’m confident we will be able to reach an agreement involving Hindu and Muslim representatives shortly after the new government is in place,” Advani reiterated at a news conference on Tuesday.“I’m confident we will be able to reach an agreement involving Hindu and Muslim representatives shortly after the new government is in place” Lal Krishan Advani,Indian Deputy Prime MinisterThe BJP rose to prominence on the back of a Hindu revivalist campaign that sought the construction of a Ram temple on the site of the 16th century mosque torn down by Hindu mobs in 1992.But since coming to power in 1999, the party has been forced by secular coalition allies to put its pet Hindu themes on hold – a move that has not gone down well with its hardline supporters, particularly in the key state of Uttar Pradesh.  Advani refused to give details and merely said talks between various parties to the row have been going on for the past several months and would produce results after the April-May elections.Thousands deadMinutes before the news conference, Advani prayed at the makeshift temple put up on the site of Babri mosque, which some Hindus claim was built by Moghul kings after destroying temple on the site of Ram’s birth.About 3000 people were killed after the mosque’s destruction in some of India’s worst Hindu-Muslim riots.Thousands died in Hindu-Muslim riots after the mosque’s destructionAdvani, a fiery orator who was the driving force behind the campaign to build the Ram temple, said the BJP remained committed to the temple campaign.“I feel very good whenever I come to Ayodhya,” said the 75-year-old Advani, on his first political visit to the dusty town since an election campaign trip in 1999.He was in Ayodhya when the mosque was razed and was briefly jailed and subsequently accused of inciting the mob until a court threw out the charges last year. “Today, when I visited the temple I could not help wonder how far is that day when all these barricades would be removed and a beautiful Ram temple is built,” Advani said, referring to the heavily fenced and guarded site.Residents unimpressedResidents of Ayodhya, however, were not impressed.“Why didn’t Advani come to Ayodhya all these years and address a rally? … Now that they need votes, they have suddenly become devout and turned to Ram”Beeresh Singh,Temple volunteer“Why didn’t Advani come to Ayodhya all these years and address a rally?” asked Beeresh Singh, a hard-line volunteer at one of the dozens of temples that dot Ayodhya.“Now that they need votes, they have suddenly become devout and turned to Ram.”“All this talk about resolving the dispute through dialogue is rubbish. We have to build the temple by force.”Analysts said Advani was playing to different audiences: trying to portray a new, moderate image as an inclusive party while telling its hardline cadres that nothing had changed.“They are prisoners of their past,” said political analyst Prem Shankar Jha. “They have to tell their core supporters that they have not moved an inch from their original positions.”“However, you can’t have a situation where they keep stoking tensions while asking for votes and try to act responsibly while in power.”",Ayodhya Ram Mandir,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2004/4/6/hindu-bjp-stokes-ayodhya-mosque-row,AL JAZEERA,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""labeling"", ""reason"": ""Loaded label 'Hindu BJP stokes Ayodhya mosque row' implies a negative connotation towards the party, while not providing parity in labeling."", ""confidence"": 0.8}",yes,labelling," 'Hindu BJP stokes Ayodhya mosque row' implies a negative connotation towards the party, while not providing parity in labeling"
174,Timeline: Babri mosque-Ram temple case,"India’s top court has ruled on the ownership of a centuries-old religious site claimed by both Hindus and Muslims.The Supreme Court on Saturday ruled that the site in Ayodhya in northern India, where Hindu mobs destroyed a 460-year-old mosque in 1992, must be handed over to a trust to oversee the construction of a Hindu temple, subject to conditions. A separate piece of land in Ayodhya would be given over to Muslim groups.The demolition of the Babri Mosque triggered some of the deadliest religious riots the country had seen since its independence in 1947.Muslims say they prayed at the medieval-era mosque for centuries while Hindus say their deity Ram was born at the site where the mosque stood before December 6, 1992.Here is a look at the key events surrounding the dispute.1528Mosque constructionBabri Mosque is built under the rule of the first Mughal king, Babur.December 23, 1949Mosque a ‘disputed property’ As idols of the Hindu deity Rama are placed inside the mosque, according to police reports, the government declares Babri Mosque a “disputed property” and its gates are locked.

175,India tightens security before landmark Ayodhya verdict,"India has deployed more than 5,000 troops and police in the northern town of Ayodhya in advance of an expected Supreme Court ruling on Saturday over control of a religious site disputed by Hindus and Muslims.Muslims said they prayed at the medieval era Babri Mosque for centuries until the idol of Ram deity was surreptitiously placed inside the mosque in 1949.Hindus believe that the mosque was built under Mughal ruler Babur after destroying a Hindu temple. In 1992, Hindu mobs demolished the Babri mosque, and constructed a makeshift temple of Lord Ram, a physical incarnation of the god Vishnu, who is believed to have been born at the site.The destruction of the 16th-century mosque sparked nationwide Hindu-Muslim violence that left about 2,000 people dead, most of them Muslims.In the decades since it was razed, religious groups have fought in the courts over who should control it.Authorities fear mass unrest, as thousands of Hindu monks and devotees have been arriving in Ayodhya located in Uttar Pradesh state in anticipation of the judgment of a five-judge bench of the Supreme Court, headed by Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi.The Supreme Court has to decide on the appeals against a key 2010 verdict by the High Court which ruled that both groups should split the site, with Hindus granted the lion’s share.The court had ruled that the disputed area of 2.77 acres (1.12 hectares) be divided into three equal parts, with two-thirds going to the Hindu community and one-third to Muslims.Sanjay Kapoor, Editor of New Delhi’s Hardnews magazine, said this dispute has changed the politics in the country.” The entire movement has changed the vocabulary of politics, the [way] people discuss this matter, it has brought BJP as a national force,” Kapoor told Al Jazeera.“In a certain way this dispute … has changed the way secular India was really conceived in 1947,” he added.Prime Minister Narendra Modi, whose Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has campaigned on promises to build a Hindu temple in place of a medieval-era mosque, called for calm.“Whatever decision the Supreme Court arrives at on Ayodhya, it will not be a victory or defeat of anyone,” Modi tweeted on Friday.“I appeal to the countrymen that all of us prioritise that this decision should further strengthen India’s great traditions of peace, unity and goodwill.”Police and home ministry officials said government agencies were making preparations to thwart any violence.“Each and every security officer is committed to prevent minor skirmishes or large-scale riots after the court delivers its verdict,” said a senior home ministry official in New Delhi.“State governments have identified several schools to set up temporary jails if the need arises,” said the official, who declined to be identified.Hindu groups say the site should be restored to Hindus in keeping with their sentiments while Muslims and secularists say the destruction of the mosque was a dangerous step towards empowering a violent nationalist mob.Provincial police chief Om Prakash Singh told Reuters that precautionary measures were in place and social media platforms were being monitored to track inflammatory posts before the verdict.“We will not tolerate Hindus or Muslims publicly displaying their reaction to the court verdict,” Singh said.Additional vehicles, CCTV cameras, body cameras and drones, too, have been brought in,” Ayodhya police senior superintendent Ashish Tiwari told the AFP on Wednesday.Muslim religious leaders have called for peace and appealed Muslims to respect court judgment in Friday sermons in many parts of the country.Navaid Hamid, president of the All India Muslim Majlis-e-Mushawarat, the top forum for Islamic organisations, said thousands of Muslim religious leaders had pledged to maintain peace and harmony after the court verdict.“The land can belong to Hindus or Muslims, but there will be no repeat of the 1992 communal violence,” said Hamid.Ayodhya – considered one of the holiest Hindu sites – is visited by religious pilgrims from all over India throughout the year.Around one million pilgrims are expected to be there early next week for a bathing ritual in the Saryu River that flows in the region.“We just have to stay alert and sensitive to the security of the visiting pilgrims,” Ayodhya district magistrate Anuj Kumar Jha told the AFP.“We are also keeping a very close watch on the social media to ensure there are no rumours or incitement.”Authorities clamped down on movement and assembly of people in the region last month when the court was concluding its hearing into the dispute.",Ayodhya Ram Mandir,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/11/9/india-tightens-security-before-landmark-ayodhya-verdict,AL JAZEERA,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""source"", ""reason"": ""The article relies heavily on statements from Hindu nationalist groups and officials, such as Prime Minister Narendra Modi's BJP, while Muslim perspectives are represented through quotes from a single individual, Navaid "", ""confidence"": 0.8}",no,none,no source bias
176,India braces for mass Hindu gathering at disputed Ayodhya site,"Indian authorities will launch a major security operation at the ruins of a 16th-century Babri mosque in Ayodhya, where hundreds of thousands of far-right Hindus are expected to gather on Sunday.The demonstrators aim to put pressure on the government to build a new Hindu temple on the disputed site.Constructed in 1528 by order of Babur, the first Mughal emperor of India, the mosque was razed on December 6, 1992, by Hindus who claimed the site was where their deity, Lord Ram, was born.The incident prompted a series of massive riots which led to the deaths of about 2,000 people across the country.Local media reported that more than 3,500 Muslims have fled the city before the gathering.Anil Pathak, the district chief of Faizabad, where the mosque is located, said: “The government will ensure that the event passes off peacefully and the local administration has put in place an elaborate security apparatus.”“No one will be allowed to disturb peace and order in the city,” he told the Reuters news agency.More than 900 extra police and a large number of military, including elite commandos, will be deployed at Sunday’s event, Vivek Tripathi, a spokesperson for the Uttar Pradesh police said.Hindu groups have insisted that there was a temple at the site before the mosque was built in the 16th century, an issue that has caused a permanent fissure in India’s social fabric and instilled fear among India’s Muslim minority.“More than 200,000 people will attend,” said Surendra Jain, general secretary of the far-right Vishwa Hindu Parishad, which will be holding a religious congregation at the disputed site in Ayodhya.“We assure everyone … that not even a twig will be disturbed.”In advance of a general election that must be held by May next year, leaders from Prime Minister Narendra Modi‘s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) – who led the Ram temple movement – have become more vocal in their demand that a new Hindu temple be built.On Wednesday, the BJP’s president said his party was “committed to building the Ram temple in Ayodhya,” and would not change its stand.Ruled by the BJP’s Yogi Adityanath, a Hindu hardliner, Ayodhya is in the politically important northern Uttar Pradesh state, which is bigger than Brazil by population, and sends more legislators than any other state to India’s parliament.Adityanath has been repeatedly accused of inciting violence against the country’s Muslim minority, who make up around 14 percent of India’s 1.3 billion people.",Ayodhya Ram Mandir,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/11/24/india-braces-for-mass-hindu-gathering-at-disputed-ayodhya-site,AL JAZEERA,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""labeling"", ""reason"": ""Loaded labels/titles applied asymmetrically: 'far-right', 'Hindu nationalist', 'hardliner' used to describe Hindu groups, while no similar labels are applied to Muslim groups."", ""confidence"": 0.8}",yes,labelling,"labels/titles applied asymmetrically: 'far-right', 'Hindu nationalist', 'hardliner' used to describe Hindu groups, while no similar labels are applied to Muslim groups"
177,Relief in India over Ayodhya ruling,"India breathed a sigh of relief on Thursday as a hotly-anticipated court ruling on ownership of a contested religious site was issued without any sign of descent into sectarian violence.Indian politicians had appealed for calm after a court ruled that both Hindus and Muslims should share a plot of land in the northern town of Ayodhya that is claimed as both a mosque and a temple.The judges gave control of the main disputed section of the site, where a mosque was torn down in 1992, to Hindus. Other parts of the site will be controlled by Muslims and another Hindu sect.The dispute over the site flared up in 1992 after a Hindu mob destroyed the mosque and nearly 2,000 were killed in ensuring rioting between Hindus and Muslims across the country.Manmohan Singh, India’s prime minister, had described the 60-year-old Babri mosque-Ram temple case as one of the biggest security challenges in India.But despite some Muslims saying they would challenge the ruling, there was no sign of a repeat of the widespread sectarian strife that many had feared the ruling would spark.“The law and order situation throughout the country has been extremely peaceful,” said P. Chidambaram, the home minister.  “We are therefore very pleased and satisfied that the people of  India have been respectful and dignified.”Compromise welcomedIndian newspapers said on Friday that the peaceful reaction to the verdict heralds a new dawn for the country, which has suffered periodic bouts of sectarian violence over the years.“The compromise nature of the verdict along with the substantive outcome of dividing the disputed land have restrained any party from claiming outright victory or sulking in total defeat,” the Hindu  newspaper said in an editorial. “On balance, the verdict should help the nation as a whole put a  longstanding dispute behind.”Analysts said that the issue was handled well by both politicians and community leaders. “People have shown a great degree of maturity, and politicians too have understood that they cannot ignite anger over the issue,” said  R.K. Mishra, a political science teacher in Saket Degree College in Ayodhya.“I think we can safely say people have grown up and have started  focusing on their priorities instead of wasting time and energy over a piece of land,” he added.But the dispute over the holy site is unlikely to end with the ruling, with Muslims unhappy with only receiving a third of the plot of land.Syed Ahmed Bukhari, the chief cleric in New Delhi’s main Jama  Masjid mosque, said he was “definitely not happy” with the ruling, adding that Muslims would not give up their claims to rebuild the mosque at the site.Asaduddin Owaisi, a Muslim member of parliament, said on Thursday that “there is anger building up among the Muslim community over the verdict but, god willing, it may not translate into street  violence.”But in Ayodhya, many Muslims were more circumspect about the ruling, with many preferring not to  comment on the case for fearing of sparking reprisals from the Hindu community.“If I say anything then chances are the Hindus will not like it  and we will start fighting again,” said Ameen Sheikh Sardar, a Muslim car mechanic in Ayodhya. “We Muslims have decided to remain silent. The less we talk about the disputed land, the better it is for the people of Ayodhya.”",Ayodhya Ram Mandir,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2010/10/1/relief-in-india-over-ayodhya-ruling,AL JAZEERA,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""tonality"", ""reason"": ""The article's tone is generally positive and celebratory towards the court ruling, using words like 'relief', 'sigh of relief', and 'peaceful reaction'.

178,"India election: Why did Modi’s BJP lose in Uttar Pradesh, its fortress?","New Delhi, India – It was April 1, All Fools’ Day.India’s elections were yet to start, but Delhi-based columnists were already calling the verdict on the biggest prize of all: Uttar Pradesh (UP), the northern state that is the country’s largest and that sends the largest chunk of legislators to the nation’s parliament. The state’s 80 members of parliament in a house of 543 often make or break the national government.In 2014 and 2019, they made the Bharatiya Janata Party’s fortunes, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s party winning 71 and 62 seats in those two elections. The columnists were predicting a repeat, a done deal for the BJP.But Hakim Sahib, a full-time mendicant and a part-time politician from Meerut, a western Uttar Pradesh (UP) city, wasn’t amused. “BJP will not win more than 40 seats in UP as there is a strong undercurrent against the party,” he told this writer.Two months later, when the results were declared on June 4 after seven stages of a staggered poll, Sahib, it turns out, had been prescient, unlike the vast majority of pollsters who had predicted a sweep for the BJP in UP and India.As the election campaign unfolded across the state of more than 200 million people, the signs were there: Modi and the BJP were clearly a powerful force, but there was a palpable, seething rage too, among many voters — including traditional supporters — over high unemployment and inflation. A clever strategy by the opposition INDIA alliance turned a BJP campaign slogan seeking 400 seats in parliament into a narrative against the governing party: The opposition claimed that the BJP could take away constitutional rights of historically disadvantaged communities such as Dalits — who sit at the bottom of India’s caste hierarchy — with such a large mandate.All of that fructified into the outcome that Sahib had predicted: The BJP ended up with just 33 seats, with its allies winning three more. The regional Samajwadi Party, a member of the Congress Party-led INDIA alliance, won 37 seats. The Congress itself won six more. That result, along with losses in the western state of Maharashtra, has forced the BJP to rely on alliance partners to form a government, short of a national majority on its own.The rumblings that led to this moment weren’t restricted to traditional BJP critics. Some ordinary voters who led to its rise felt let down too.In 1992, the BJP led a campaign that culminated in the demolition of the 16th-century Babri mosque in the UP temple town of Ayodhya. On December 6 that year, when images of the shrine being pulled down stunned the rest of India and shocked the world, Mohan was at the site, a part of the mob that smashed the mosque into rubble.In January this year, Modi consecrated a grand Ram temple at the same spot: The Hindu deity Ram, according to ancient scriptures, was born in Ayodhya. It was a moment that — like the 1992 demolition — was screened across the world, and that emerged as the launchpad of Modi’s 2024 re-election campaign.But when this writer spoke to Mohan — who requested that his last name not be used — in April, he was clear that he had given up on the BJP. He has an unemployed son, who was initially tempted to join the Modi government’s scheme to send Indian workers to Israel as labourers amid the war on Gaza. The son eventually turned down that option.“This time the BJP will not come to power in the parliament elections. I will call you on June 4 to confirm this,” Mohan declared.He was partially wrong — the BJP is poised to form the next government, with its allies. Yet in Faizabad, the constituency that includes the Ram temple, the BJP lost. And Mohan’s comments were mirrored in sentiments that voters shared even in Modi’s own parliamentary constituency of Varanasi.His imprimatur is visible in the infrastructure development work throughout the city: a highway to the airport; cleaned up banks of the Ganges; widened roads to Varanasi’s biggest attraction, the Kashi Vishwanath Temple.But these changes have robbed the city of its identity, said, Vishambhar Mishra, a professor at the city’s Indian Institute of Technology and the head of the Sankat Mochan Trust that campaigns for cleaning up the Ganges.“Varanasi used to be the city of lanes and bylanes. People could start from wherever and negotiate the lanes to reach the ghats to take a dip in the Ganges,” he said. Meanwhile, the Ganges remains dirty, despite multiple promises from the government to clean it up — a contradiction he routinely highlights in posts on social media platform X.On the Ganges, boatman Bhanu Chaudhary, who took this writer for a ride, said: “There is a lot of anger in people as there are no jobs.” Chaudhary is a graduate but is forced to row boats for visitors to the city because he has no other work.That anger showed on June 4. Modi won the seat, but with his margin dramatically slashed, from 480,000 votes in 2019 to 152,000 this time. Many of the constituencies near Varanasi, which the BJP had hoped to win riding on Modi’s presence in the city, went to the INDIA alliance.But the biggest reason for voters shifting away from the BJP may have been the party’s own statements, say observers.The slogan insisting that the BJP-led alliance would win 400 seats spooked many Dalits, who feared that the party could change the constitution — whose drafting was led by Dalit icon Bhimrao Ambedkar — to deny them hard-won protections, said Inderjit Singh a teacher in Gorakhpur, a northern UP city. “So many seats slipped out of the BJP fold,” he said.The opposition INDIA alliance, initial data suggests, managed to successfully stitch together a coalition of Dalits, other traditionally disadvantaged communities — known as Other Backward Classes (OBCs) in India — and Muslims in many parts of the state.“They want to change the constitution of India and stop job reservation,” claimed Gautam Rane, a Dalit activist who campaigned against the BJP. The BJP has denied that it ever had any intentions of taking away benefits that Dalits are promised in the constitution, including quotas in government jobs and educational institutions.Rane said many Dalit voters had ditched the Bahujan Samaj Party, which has for long led the community in UP, because they felt it was too weak now to take on the BJP. The BSP still won 9 percent of the state’s vote but lost in all constituencies: It had won 10 seats in 2019.Meanwhile, Modi’s comments against Muslims during the campaign — he referred to them as “infiltrators” — galvanised the community, which forms almost 20 percent of UP’s population, behind the opposition alliance, said Nawab Hussain Afsar, the editor of a Urdu daily headquartered in Lucknow, the state’s capital.And they struck back, with their votes.",Ayodhya Ram Mandir,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/6/6/india-election-why-did-modis-bjp-lose-in-uttar-pradesh-its-fortress,AL JAZEERA,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""framing"", ""reason"": ""The article frames the BJP's loss in Uttar Pradesh as a result of its own statements and actions, rather than external factors.

179,Indian PM to attend temple groundbreaking at disputed site: Trust,"Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi will attend a groundbreaking ceremony next month for a Hindu temple on a disputed site in northern India where a 16th-century mosque was torn down by a Hindu mob in 1992, according to the trust overseeing the temple’s construction.The ceremony is set for August 5, a date organisers said was astrologically auspicious for Hindus but that also marks a year since New Delhi revoked the semi-autonomous status of its only Muslim-majority state, Jammu and Kashmir.The symbolism was impossible to miss for both supporters and opponents of Modi’s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).The right-wing party’s manifesto had for decades included pledges to strip Indian-administered Kashmir of its autonomy and to build a temple to the Hindu god Ram where the Mughal-era Babri Mosque once stood, a site in the city of Ayodhya in Uttar Pradesh state that devotees believe to be Ram’s birthplace.Because the coronavirus is still rampaging across India, the ceremony will be broadcast live on state television and the number of participants and spectators will be limited, according to the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (World Hindu Organisation), a far-right group allied with the BJP.The temple will serve as “an enduring and immortal beaming center of social harmony, national unity and integration and awakening of the feeling of Hindutva [Hinduness],” the organisation’s spokesman, Vinod Bansal, said in a news release on Saturday.A century-long dispute over the site was resolved last year following the BJP’s landslide election victory. In November, the Supreme Court ruled in favour of the temple trust, saying that Muslim petitioners would be given 5 acres (about 2 hectares) at an alternative site.Hindu hardliners have long contended that Mughal rulers built a mosque on top of a pre-existing temple in Ayodhya, though an archaeological study of the site has not yet confirmed it.Religious violence across India that followed the December 6, 1992 demolition of the mosque resulted in the killing of about 2,000 people, most of them Muslims.Meanwhile, the trial in the demolition case continues to be heard in a special court.Preparations underway in Ayodhya, ahead of inauguration of the construction of Lord Ram's temple.Prime Minister Narendra Modi will lay the foundation stone of Ram Temple on August 5. pic.twitter.com/S3Rzx52B71— ANI UP (@ANINewsUP) July 27, 2020An architect from Ahmedabad, in Modi’s home state Gujarat, has proposed a towering sandstone structure 49 metres (161 feet) high with five domes.Yogi Adityanath, Uttar Pradesh’s chief minister and a controversial Hindu monk, requested that Ayodhya hold a special cleaning and purification ceremony and for all of the city’s temples to light oil lamps before Modi’s visit, the Press Trust of India news agency reported.Adityanath said the occasion marked the end of a “500-year struggle”, PTI reported.The high-profile event is being held as India reported more than 1.4 million confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus, making it the third most-affected nation.",Ayodhya Ram Mandir,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/7/27/indian-pm-to-attend-temple-groundbreaking-at-disputed-site-trust,AL JAZEERA,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""framing"", ""reason"": ""The article frames the event as a 'disputed site' and highlights the Hindu nationalist perspective, while downplaying or omitting other perspectives."", ""confidence"": 0.8}",yes,framing," frames the event as a 'disputed site' and highlights the Hindu nationalist perspective, while downplaying or omitting other perspectives"
180,India’s Supreme Court orders mediation over disputed Ayodhya site,"India’s Supreme Court has appointed an arbitration panel to mediate in a decades-long dispute over a religious site in northern Uttar Pradesh state’s Ayodhya city.The court on Friday ruled that the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid dispute, as the contentious case is known as, will now be mediated through a panel headed by retired Supreme Court judge FM Kalifulla.The other members of the arbitration panel include senior advocate, Sriram Panchu, and self-styled Hindu godman, Sri Sri Ravi Shankar.The 70-year-old case involves a dispute over a one-hectare site in Ayodhya, where right-wing Hindus plan to build a temple dedicated to Lord Ram on the ruins of a 16th-century mosque demolished in 1992.The Supreme Court-appointed arbitration panel has been given eight weeks to come to an agreement, which coincides with India’s national elections, due in April and May.Hindu nationalist forces affiliated with India’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have ratcheted up their long-standing demand for the construction of a temple in the run-up to the election.A five-judge Supreme Court bench, headed by Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi, said the order is a bid to “heal the hearts if possible”.The court described the dispute as a “festering wound” which has touched the religious sentiments of Hindus and Muslims for decades and led to multiple rounds of communal violence.In 1992, a Hindu mob tore down the Mughal-era mosque, triggering riots that killed about 2,000 people in one of the worst instances of communal violence in India since the 1947 partition of the country.Out of concern for the sensitive nature of the subject, the court has directed the panel members to maintain utmost secrecy. The media has also been banned from covering its proceedings.While holding control over the controversial site, the Supreme Court had been weighing petitions from both the communities on what should be built there.Earlier, a five-judge panel, headed by Gogoi, had asked both Hindu and Muslim groups involved in the case to explore the possibility of resolving their dispute through mediation.After lower courts heard the case for several years, the Supreme Court took up the matter in 2011, when it suspended a high court ruling that the disputed site be split into three parts, with one portion going to Muslims and the other two to Hindus.Hindu and Muslim groups challenged the verdict and appealed to the Supreme Court, which criticised the ruling and said the high court overstepped its authority by ordering the partition.Hindu groups say there used to be a temple at the site before the mosque was built by Mughal ruler Zahir-ud Din Babar in the early 16th century.It is the most divisive dispute between India’s majority Hindus and minority Muslims, who make up around 14 percent of the country’s 1.3 billion people.Right-wing groups affiliated to the BJP had called for legislation to allow a temple to be built, bypassing the Supreme Court. But Prime Minister Narendra Modi later said the judicial process should be allowed to take its course.Far-right Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP), or the World Hindu Council, which has led the Ram temple campaign over the past three decades, organised rallies in recent months to press its case.",Ayodhya Ram Mandir,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/3/8/indias-supreme-court-orders-mediation-over-disputed-ayodhya-site,AL JAZEERA,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""framing"", ""reason"": ""The article frames the dispute as a 'festering wound' that has touched the religious sentiments of Hindus and Muslims, implying a moral evaluation that favors Hindu nationalist forces."", ""confidence"": 0.8}",yes,framing,"frames the dispute as a 'festering wound' that has touched the religious sentiments of Hindus and Muslims, implying a moral evaluation that favors Hindu nationalist forces."
181,Indian Muslims to seek review of Hindu temple site ruling,"An Indian Muslim group has said it will file a petition in the Supreme Court asking for a review of a ruling that awarded a disputed site in northern Uttar Pradesh state to Hindus, allowing them to build a temple there.The All India Muslim Personal Law Board, an umbrella body of intellectuals and organisations, said on Sunday it would seek a review of the judgement, which rejected Muslim claims over the land.In a landmark verdict on November 9, India‘s top court ruled that a 2.77 acre (1.1 hectare) plot of land in the town of Ayodhya should be awarded to Hindus, who believe it is the birthplace of Lord Ram, a physical incarnation of the Hindu God Vishnu.The five-judge bench said Muslims will be given five acres of land at an alternative site in Ayodhya.“There are apparent errors in the Supreme Court judgement, and we felt that it would be prudent to file a review petition,” Syed Qasim Ilyas, a member of the group, told a press briefing.The main Muslim litigant in the case, the Sunni Waqf Board, has declined to file a review petition saying it respected the verdict.The site in Hindu-majority Ayodhya has been the centre of a bitter dispute between India’s majority Hindus and Muslims, who make up about 14 percent of the population, since Indian independence.A 16th-century mosque, known as Babri Masjid, had been at the site until December 6, 1992, when it was destroyed by Hindu mobs.The country later witnessed some of the deadliest religious riots since independence, in which thousands of mostly Muslim Indians were killed.Hindus believe that Lord Ram, the warrior god, was born at the site in Ayodhya and claim the first Mughal emperor Babur built the mosque on top of a temple there.The Supreme Court verdict – announced amid heightened security across the country – was hailed by Hindus, but prompted a mixed reaction among the Muslim community in Ayodhya.Some welcomed the decision, others rejected it, and there was a feeling of resignation – that Muslims had no choice but to accept the court’s decision.",Ayodhya Ram Mandir,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/11/17/indian-muslims-to-seek-review-of-hindu-temple-site-ruling,AL JAZEERA,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""omission"", ""reason"": ""Key facts about the Hindu perspective on the site's significance and the court's decision are presented, but the article does not provide a more nuanced or detailed explanation of the Muslim perspective beyond their reac"", ""confidence"": 0.8}",yes,omission, the article does not provide a more nuanced or detailed explanation of the Muslim perspective 
182,India: The main takeaways from BJP’s manifesto,"New Delhi, India – India’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Monday released its election manifesto, just days before the country’s general election.The Hindu nationalist party outlined 75 milestones in its manifesto, which it promises to achieve in the next few years if voted back to power.“Nationalism is our inspiration,” Prime Minister Narendra Modi said at the release of the BJP manifesto at the party headquarters in New Delhi.Among the promises are some of the BJP’s core issues, including the abrogation of Article 370 that grants Jammu and Kashmir state a special status within the Indian union.Here are the main takeaways from the newly released manifesto.The BJP has proposed to abrogate Article 370 of the constitution, which gives special status to the state of Jammu and Kashmir.It also promises to scrap Article 35A, which empowers the Jammu and Kashmir state’s legislature to define “permanent resident” of the state and provide special rights and privileges to those permanent residents, which are excluded for non-permanent residents.Removal of Article 35A would allow non-residents to buy land in Indian-administered Kashmir.Sheikh Showkat, a Srinagar-based political commentator and law professor, said that there is nothing new in the BJP’s mentioning of abrogation of Article 370 in their election manifesto.“They (the BJP) keep certain things in their manifesto despite the fact that it is impossible for them to do away with them or accomplish them,” Showkat told Al Jazeera.“They are just trying to polarise the Hindu vote in their favour,” he said.“I don’t understand why they have mentioned Article 35A, which is part of Article 370.”The BJP in its manifesto reiterated its stance for supporting the construction of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya in Uttar Pradesh.“We reiterate our stand to explore all possibilities within the framework of the Constitution to facilitate the construction of a Ram Temple in Ayodhya,” the manifesto reads.Political analyst and academic Sanjay Kumar told Al Jazeera that he is not surprised that the issue of Article 370 and Ram temple is mentioned in the BJP’s manifesto.“It has become a compulsion for the BJP to mention these issues in the manifesto otherwise people will start asking questions what happened to these issues,” Kumar, a professor at Centre for the Study of Developing Societies in New Delhi, said.The BJP promised to reserve 33 percent of seats in Parliament and state assemblies for women through a constitutional amendment, if it returns to power.The manifesto said that the women’s welfare and development would be accorded high priority at all levels within the government.Secretary of the All India Progressive Women’s Association, Kavita Krishnan, told Al Jazeera that the pledge was merely “lip service”.“They had the power to implement this in the last five years and they had absolute majority, still they did not table it,” Krishnan said.The party also promised farmers, who have taken to the streets several times over the past few years, that their income would be doubled by 2022.The party had promised in 2014 to double farmers’ income and on Monday, it pledged to exert all efforts to achieve this goal by 2022.The BJP also pledged to revise income tax brackets to help the middle class if the party retained power in the upcoming election.Food policy analyst, Devinder Sharma, told Al Jazeera that the party had pledged to raise farmers’ incomes in the past and to date had not taken concrete steps to achieve that.“All what this government has been able to achieve is zero increase in the real income of the farmers,” Sharma said.Commenting on the pledge to revise income tax laws, economist and business expert, Akash Jindal, said the pledge would be a positive step.“If the middle class is given taxation concessions, it can work wonders for the economy because what would happen is that purchasing power would increase,” Jindal told Al Jazeera.If executed, the pledge would boost India’s economy and would decrease deficit, Jindal noted.",Ayodhya Ram Mandir,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/4/8/india-the-main-takeaways-from-bjps-manifesto,AL JAZEERA,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""source"", ""reason"": ""The article relies heavily on Al Jazeera's interviews with Sheikh Showkat and Sanjay Kumar, both of whom are critical of the BJP.

183,Can India’s version of The Onion beat hate with laughter?,"New Delhi, India – When Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was inaugurating a controversial Hindu temple in the northern city of Ayodhya on January 22 this year, J*, a student living hundreds of miles away in the southern state of Kerala was about to post his take on the event on Instagram.“Remains of Indian Constitution Beneath Ram Mandir: ASI Survey,” the 21-year-old student of humanities posted on his handle, The Savala Vada, criticising the Hindu nationalist leader for allegedly undermining India’s secular constitution by leading a religious ceremony at a temple built on the ruins of a 16th-century mosque.Since India’s independence in 1947, dozens of Hindu groups, led by the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the far-right ideological mentor of Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), claimed the Mughal-era Babri Mosque stood at the exact site where Ram, among Hinduism’s most prominent deities, was born. A Hindu mob demolished the mosque in 1992, triggering deadly riots that killed more than 2,000 people and fundamentally altered the course of India’s politics.After the demolition, the state-run Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) backed the Hindu groups’ claim as the dispute went to the country’s top court, which in 2019 gave the site to a government-backed trust to build a Ram temple. Muslims were given another piece of land in Ayodhya, several kilometres away from the temple, to build a mosque.A year later, Modi laid the foundation stone for the grand temple and opened it in January this year to kick-start his re-election for a record third term.As soon as J made the Instagram post, it went viral. It invited backlash from right-wing Hindu trolls. But it also helped The Savala Vada to grow exponentially.J and his two teammates working with him on the handle prefer to remain anonymous over fears they “could get attacked or killed”, as they put it.“There is an entire ecosystem in place that is targeting people who dissent,” J said. “It’s also about protecting oneself when you are speaking in an online space against the ruling establishment and power. Anonymity gives me that protection.”Al Jazeera sought comments from multiple BJP spokespersons on J’s allegations, but did not receive a response.Inspired by The Onion, the United States digital media company that publishes satirical articles on local and international news, The Savala Vada was launched by J on July 21, 2023. “Savala” in Malayalam language means onion, and “vada” is a popular South Indian snack. J said his venture is also a “homage” to the kind of work The Onion does.“The idea came out of a need to create a space where we could discuss and put out contemporary sociopolitical events with a humorous and satirical spin,” he told Al Jazeera.“It was also about envisioning a democratic, secular and pluralistic space where we report the truth by using tropes of comedy and satire.”The Instagram handle, said J, started with posts about cultural or historical events but slowly began to focus on news and current affairs to channel what he called his disillusionment with the mainstream Indian media, which many critics have accused of amplifying the BJP’s hate politics against minority Muslims and Christians, as well as being subservient to Modi.“I belong to a minority religious community and it is extremely difficult to voice your dissent in the current polarised times,” J said, adding that his focus was to “combine humour and resistance” while also reaching out to Gen Z and millennials through his satire.Apart from The Onion, J said he was also inspired by American comedian George Carlin, British stand-up John Oliver, and Australia’s The Juice Media, which posts satirical takes targeting the government.Over the past year, The Savala Vada has made more than 680 Instagram posts and gained close to 69,000 followers. Last month, it saw 7.8 million views on its posts and stories.The handle responds to major national and global events, its precise and direct headlines condensed in a manner that challenges the established narrative through humour and satire.For example, when Israeli air strikes denied targeting hospitals in Gaza during the continuing genocide, The Savala Vada wrote: “Israeli Defence Forces Claim Gaza Armed With Self-Exploding Hospitals”.When several Indian journalists flew to Israel to cover the Israel-Palestine conflict, the handle posted: “Air India Flights To Israel Cheaper Than To Manipur for Indian Journos” – a take on the same journalists or their organisations refusing to report on ethnic riots in India’s northeast that have been going on for more than a year.To mock the state of journalism in India, they once wrote: “Mainstream Indian Journalism Committed To Sacred Duty Of Endangering Lives of Muslims.”Some of their posts responded to the situation in the disputed territory of Indian-administered Kashmir, which was stripped of its partial autonomy by Modi’s government in 2019. The move, Kashmiris say, is aimed at stealing their resources and changing the demography of the Muslim-majority region.“Lack of Snow Disappoints Indian Tourists While Lack Of Human Rights Disappoints Kashmiris,” said one of their viral posts about the mountainous region that is popular among Indian tourists for its snow and skiing. “Indian Army Starts Teaching Political Science In Kashmir High Schools,” said another, a reference to one of the world’s most militarised zones where the army enjoys enormous powers and impunity.Journalist Rana Ayyub, an opinion writer at The Washington Post and a critic of the Indian government, told Al Jazeera she follows The Savala Vada and often shares their posts online to underline the fact that mainstream journalism in India is “gasping for breath”.“They speak for the oppressed the way our mainstream media don’t,” Rana said. “The handle is an excellent example of holding truth to power by using satire and hitting the nail on the head. They’ve filled the void that the Indian mainstream media left.”But things have not been easy for The Savala Vada. Its X handle has been blocked twice. In the first instance, it changed its handle name and image to “Narendra Modi” to post an Eid Mubarak greeting, and promised to ban the RSS and release all political prisoners to mark the Muslim festival.The second time the X handle was blocked was when it was mass-reported to the microblogging platform by Hindu right-wing trolls, some with tens of thousands of followers. “It’s a means of intimidation, to stop us from doing our work,” J said. “It clearly means that they are disturbed by what we post.”J claimed their Instagram handle has also often been shadow-banned by the platform. Then there are online abuses and threats, with people calling them “mullah” (a slur for Muslims), “Jihadi”, “Pakistani”, “Chinese” and “antinational’ among other things.They have also been threatened with police cases and lawsuits, most of them during the consecration of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya, said J.“It feels scary and depressing. But it is also funny sometimes,” he said. “We receive those slurs and laugh it off. People, mostly from the right wing, often don’t get sarcasm. We pin those comments [on social media] and joke about it.“Our job is not to offend the sensibilities of any community but to point out the absurdity of the reality we are living in. And satire becomes a powerful tool because it resonates with people,” he said.Satire is also risky. “To pursue satire in the world’s largest democracy is not easy. A joke or merely having a different opinion can land you in jail,” J said.India was ranked 159th in this year’s World Press Freedom Index which is released by Reporters Without Borders annually – a marginal improvement from 2023’s 161, but still significantly down from 140 in 2013.“Free speech in India has sunk into a perilous abyss, and steadily falling press freedom indices underscore the dangers of crossing a line that is becoming increasingly contentious,” watchdog the Free Speech Collective said in a report earlier this year.The censorship and surveillance of India are the reason, J said, why The Savala Vada does not want to create a website or start a print version, like The Onion. “It will leave a digital footprint online and it will become easy for the government to go against us,” said J.During the Indian general elections this year, The Savala Vada collaborated with Australia’s The Juice Media on their Honest Government Ads project, which offers satirical commentary on the state of democracy in poll-bound countries. This year, they included 14 nations, including India, Pakistan, the United States, Indonesia and Iran, among others.A video posted by the group on YouTube featured a “public service announcement” that critiqued the Modi government for imprisoning opposition leaders, threatening journalists, bulldozing the homes of Muslims and targeting free speech in the world’s largest democracy.The video was blocked by YouTube following a request by the Indian government. The Juice Media said it received a legal complaint from a government entity in India, which accused the Australian company of provocation to cause riots and insulting the Indian flag and constitution.After the video was taken down, J feared the government would also act against The Savala Vada. “At that moment, I thought they were going to come after us,” he told Al Jazeera, adding that the fear forced him to remove any reference to The Savala Vada on its Instagram page.Journalist and media researcher Anand Mangnale said a new pattern of right-wing outrage has emerged on social media, and it is more organised.“Earlier there would be abuses and trolls online, but what we witness now is much more organised,” he told Al Jazeera.“Now the groups are being created online to target certain individuals or mass-report any content. It then becomes ammunition for a legal case. The cases are not based on law and order but on the fake outrage they create on social media,” he said.In recent years, a number of mainstream Indian journalists, who refused to follow the diktats of their employers or quit private corporations, have taken to YouTube and Instagram to continue their work. J said he, like them, is trying to “democratise the same information space with a satirical spin”.“In the current world that is so bleak and dystopian, we are trying to imagine a different world, a world where we counter narratives, uplift marginalised voices, and fight against hate,” he said.By making readers laugh.",Ayodhya Ram Mandir,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/10/can-india-version-the-onion-beat-hate-with-laughter,AL JAZEERA,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""tonality"", ""reason"": ""The article's tone is consistently critical of the Indian government and right-wing Hindu groups, using words like 'hate', 'intimidation', 'scary', and 'depressing' to describe their actions.

184,Hindu prayers begin inside India’s Mughal-era mosque after court order,"Hindu worshippers have begun praying inside a 17th-century mosque in the Indian city of Varanasi, hours after a court order gave them the go-ahead at the disputed site.The Gyanvapi Mosque in Varanasi is one of several Muslim places of worship that right-wing Hindu groups, backed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), have sought for decades to reclaim.Varanasi is Modi’s parliamentary constituency in Uttar Pradesh, India’s most populous state, also governed by the BJP.On Wednesday, a local court ruled that Hindu worshippers could pray in the building’s basement and ordered the authorities to “make proper arrangements” for worshippers within a week.Indian media reports said the family members of Hindu priests started praying in the mosque’s basement in the early hours of Thursday.#WATCH | A priest offers prayers at 'Vyas Ji ka Tehkhana' inside Gyanvapi mosque in Varanasi, after District court order.Visuals confirmed by Vishnu Shankar Jain, the lawyer for the Hindu side in the Gyanvapi case pic.twitter.com/mUB6TMGpET— ANI (@ANI) February 1, 2024Akhlaq Ahmad, the lawyer representing Muslim petitioners, said the court order would be appealed.The Gyanvapi Mosque was built during the Mughal Empire in a city where Hindus from across the country cremate relatives by the Ganges river. Hindu worshippers claim the mosque replaced a temple to the Hindu deity Shiva.Last month, the Archaeological Survey of India said a survey of the site appeared to corroborate the belief that it was originally home to a temple.Emboldened right-wing Hindu groups have laid claim to several Muslim sites of worship they say were built atop ancient temples during Mughal rule.Meanwhile, bulldozers have knocked down a centuries-old mosque in India’s capital, a member of the building’s managing committee said.The Masjid Akhonji in New Delhi, which its caretakers say is about 600 years old, was home to 22 students enrolled in an Islamic boarding school.It was torn down on Tuesday in a forest of Mehrauli, an affluent neighbourhood dotted with centuries-old ruins from settlements predating modern Delhi.In Mehrauli, Delhi, the Delhi Development Authority carried out an arbitrary demolition of a 600-year-old mosque on Tuesday.Imam Zakir Hussain stated that Masjid Akhonji, which housed Madrasa Bahrul Uloom and the graves of revered figures, was completely razed. pic.twitter.com/tjEWowUfQN— Maktoob (@MaktoobMedia) January 31, 2024Mohammad Zaffar, a member of the mosque’s managing committee, told the Agence France-Presse news agency it did not receive any prior notice before a demolition was carried out “in the dark of the night”.He said many graves in the mosque compound were also desecrated and no one was allowed to take out copies of the Quran or other materials from inside the mosque before it was razed.“Many of our revered figures and my own ancestors were buried there. There is no trace of the graves now,” Zaffar told AFP. “The rubble from the mosque and the graves has been removed and dumped somewhere else.”The officials said the demolition was part of a drive to remove “illegal” structures from a forest reserve.Calls for India to enshrine Hindu supremacy have grown rapidly louder since Modi took office in 2014, making its roughly 200-million-strong Muslim minority – the world’s third-largest Muslim population – increasingly anxious about its future.Last week, Modi presided over a grand inauguration ceremony in the nearby city of Ayodhya for a Hindu temple built on the former grounds of another Mughal-era mosque.Hindu zealots had torn down the Babri Mosque in 1992 in a campaign spearheaded by members of Modi’s party, sparking sectarian riots that killed 2,000 people nationwide, most of them Muslims.A decades-long court battle that ensued over the future of the Babri site ended in 2019 when India’s top court permitted the construction of a temple to the deity Ram, who, according to Hindu scripture, was born in the city.The consecration of the Ram temple by Modi fulfilled a 35-year-old pledge of the BJP and has been portrayed by the party and its affiliates as a Hindu reawakening. It also came months ahead of national elections due by May and is expected to boost Modi’s chances of winning a third term.Critics accuse Modi of pushing a pro-Hindu agenda and promoting discrimination against Muslims, but he says his government does not do so.Last week, a senior leader of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the BJP’s far-right ideological mentor, questioned whether Gyanvapi Mosque and three others, including the razed one in Ayodhya, were mosques at all.“Whether we should consider them mosques or not, the people of the country and the world should think about it. They should stand with the truth, or they should stand with the wrong?” Indresh Kumar told Reuters news agency in an interview.“Accept the truth.

185,‘Cultural encroachment’: PM Oli says Hindu deity Ram from Nepal,"Nepali Prime Minister Khadga Prasad Sharma Oli has said that Hindu deity Ram was born in the Himalayan nation and not India, as he accused New Delhi of “encroaching on cultural facts” amid frayed diplomatic relations between the two South Asian neighbours.“We have been oppressed a bit culturally. Facts have been encroached,” Oli said at a function at his residence in the capital, Kathmandu, on Monday, according to Nepali news website setopati.com.According to Hindu mythology, Lord Ram was born in Ayodhya town located in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh and married to Sita from Janakpur located in present-day Nepal.But the 68-year-old leader claimed Ayodhya is a village to the west of the Nepali border town of Birgunj. He added that Ayodhya in Uttar Pradesh, about 135km from state capital Lucknow, is a more recent creation of India’s.“We still believe that we gave Sita to Indian Prince Ram. But we gave to the prince from Ayodhya, not India. Ayodhya is a village a little west to Birgunj, not the Ayodhya created now,” he was quoted as saying by setopati.com.India’s Hindu far-right believe Ram was born at the site of a medieval-era mosque. The Babri mosque was demolished by a Hindu mob in 1992. Last year India’s Supreme Court gave the disputed land to Hindus to build a Ram Temple, asking Muslims to build a mosque far from the site.On Tuesday, Nepal’s foreign ministry sought to clarify Oli’s comments.“As there have been several myths and references about Shri Ram and the places associated with him, the prime minister was simply highlighting the importance of further studies and research of the vast cultural geography the Ramayana represents to obtain facts about Shri Ram, Ramayana and the various places linked to this rich civilization,” the ministry said in a statement.“The remarks were not meant to debasing the significance of Ayodhya and the cultural value it bears.”The Nepali prime minister has attacked India several times since a diplomatic row erupted on May 8 when New Delhi inaugurated a Himalayan road link passing through the disputed territory of Kalapani. Nepal opposes a controversial Indian map published last November that showed Kalapani in India.Last month, Nepal’s parliament approved a new political map, showing Kalapani, Lipulekh and Limpiyadhura within its borders, drawing strong reactions from India.Oli has in the past accused New Delhi of conspiring to topple his government, and last week banned private Indian channels for “character assassination” and airing “false propaganda”.Analysts say Oli’s tirade against India likely aims to divert attention from domestic political troubles.

186,The dispute over the Babri mosque,"The demolished Babri mosque complex in India’s northern city of Ayodhya has been one of the most disputed religious sites in the world for more than 400 years.Constructed in 1528 by order of Babur, the first Mughal emperor of India, the mosque was torn down on December 6, 1992 by Hindu nationalists who claim that the site is where their deity, Lord Ram, was born.Some Hindus say Babur built the mosque after destroying an existing Hindu temple at the site.Shortly after India’s independence from British colonial rule in 1947, a group of right-wing Hindus filed a petition in the Allahabad high court in Uttar Pradesh state where Ayodhya is located.They demanded the complex be handed over to them so that the temple to Ram could be reconstructed, although little came of their efforts.Political issueThe issue remained low-key until the late 1980s when the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) rekindled it as part of a strategy to garner political support from India’s Hindu population.The BJP took to the streets demanding the complex be handed over to them for “reconstruction” of the Ram temple.In December 1992, tens of thousands of Hindus, led by then-BJP president Lal Krishna Advani and many senior BJP leaders, gathered at Ayodhya.The leaders reportedly lost control of the situation and mobs attacked the three-dome structure, razing it to the ground in a matter of hours.The incident sparked a series of massive riots, which lead to the deaths of thousands of people.Years later, the Allahabad court ordered the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) to dig beneath the disputed site to determine whether ruins of a temple exist under the rubble.The ASI said its 2003 survey, conducted with hi-tech radar technology, did indeed reveal remnants of a temple below the compound.But many Muslims strongly criticised the report, saying that it was biased and failed to provide adequate evidence.An inquiry into the destruction of the mosque in 1992 was blaming leading BJP politicians for the violence that followed.Now, on Thursday at 1530 local time (1000 GMT), a high court ruling in the Ayodhya case is due to be announced in the city of Lucknow, in Uttar Pradesh state, on whether the land of the religious site belongs to Muslims or Hindus.Three judges will give the verdict, two of them are Hindu and one is Muslim.",Ayodhya Ram Mandir,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2010/9/30/the-dispute-over-the-babri-mosque,AL JAZEERA,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""source"", ""reason"": ""The article relies on a report from the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) that is criticized by many Muslims as biased, without presenting credible counter-sources."", ""confidence"": 0.8}",yes,source,"relies on a report from the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) that is criticized by many Muslims as biased, without presenting credible counter-sources"
187,Babri mosque demolition case: India’s BJP leaders acquitted,"A special court in the Indian city of Lucknow has ruled that the demolition of the 16th-century Babri mosque in 1992 by Hindu rioters was not preplanned, acquitting senior leaders from the governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) over a lack of evidence.The trial court of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) announced the verdict in the 28-year-old case involving 32 accused, including former Deputy Prime Minister Lal Krishna Advani, 92, – a one-time mentor of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.All the 32 people were accused of criminal conspiracy and inciting a mob to tear down the Mughal-era mosque in the northern town of Ayodhya, located about 135km (84 miles) east of the state capital, Lucknow, in 1992. The demolition sparked nationwide communal violence that left some 2,000 people dead, most of them Muslims.Other senior leaders among those acquitted on Wednesday are former ministers Murli Manohar Joshi, Uma Bharti, Vinay Katiyar and former Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh Kalyan Singh.This is an erroneous judgement as it is against evidence and against lawby Zafaryab Jilani, a lawyer for the All India Muslim Personal Law BoardHanding down its verdict after a lengthy legal battle, the court said there was not enough evidence to directly tie any of the accused to the violence, defence lawyer Manish Kumar Tripathi said.“The court did not accept the evidence, it was not strong enough,” Tripathi told reporters at the court.IB Singh, another defence lawyer, said investigators could not prove the authenticity of audio and video evidence submitted in the case and the judge held that the case lacked legal evidence that the accused were part of any conspiracy.Senior journalist Ruchira Gupta witnessed the incident 28 years ago. She testified before the government-appointed inquiry commission headed by Justice Manmohan Singh Liberhan. The commission submitted its report 17 years later indicting senior leaders from the BJP.They were deliberately enticing crowds to demolish the mosque and kept raising the slogan give one push and demolish the mosque. Is that not deliberate? There was no ambiguity in that sloganby Senior journalist Ruchira Gupta“I was an eyewitness to all that happened. On the day of the demolition, I was on the terrace with BJP and RSS [Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh] leaders like LK Advani, Uma Bharati, Murli Manohar Joshi, Mohan Bhagwat, among several others,” she told Al Jazeera.“They were deliberately enticing crowds to demolish the mosque and kept raising the slogan ‘Give one push and demolish the mosque’. Is that not deliberate? There was no ambiguity in that slogan.“On the day of the demolition, Advani kept announcing on microphone that security forces should not be allowed near the mosque. Is that not deliberate intent? Pravin Jain, a photographer, who was there on the day of the demolition said that he saw dress rehearsal of demolition of mosque. I have testified before Liberhan Commission and surprisingly CBI never asked me to testify which is proof that they had already decided the outcome.”Reacting to the verdict, Advani said it was “a moment of happiness for all of us while Joshi said: “The truth has triumphed”.Another defendant who was acquitted, Jai Bhagwan Goyal, said: “We had done nothing wrong. The whole of India is happy. Lord Ram’s temple is coming up in Ayodhya city.”The four BJP leaders acquitted – Advani, Joshi, Bharti and Singh – have said the mosque’s demolition was a spontaneous eruption by an angry Hindu crowd.The court in its verdict said that “anti-social elements” tried to demolish the mosque and that the accused leaders tried to stop them, the New Delhi Television news channel reported, citing the court order.Please note: the Supreme Court had termed the demolition of the #BabriMasjid a ‘criminal’ act. Today, the special court has termed it a ‘spontaneous’ act.

The court did say the demolition of the mosque was a criminal act. It also asked the government to provide five acres (two hectares) of land to Muslims at another location as a substitute for the land they had lost.Last month, Modi inaugurated the construction of the temple, which was one of the promises the BJP made when the party was founded in the 1980s. The party rose to national prominence on the back of the temple movement.Many Hindus believe the 16th-century mosque, named after Mughal emperor Babur, was built on the location of Ram’s birthplace in Ayodhya.On December 6, 1992, tens of thousands of Hindus gathered for a rally near the disputed site and groups of them climbed the mosque and demolished it with axes and hammers.A BJP spokesperson welcomed the verdict. “Today’s verdict clearly suggested that the court has carefully looked at all evidence and claimed that it was not preplanned conspiracy or any criminal intent by the senior BJP leaders,” Syed Zafar Islam, the BJP spokesperson, told Al Jazeera.“In the past, there was political pressure to implicate senior leaders of the BJP who always denied any criminal intent. Their stand has been vindicated today.”In a press release, the Pakistan Ministry of Foreign Affairs condemned the acquittal as “shameful”.“This is yet another manifestation of the pliant judiciary under the extremist BJP-RSS regime in which extremist ‘Hindutva’ ideology takes precedence over all principles of justice and international norms,” the statement said.Akash Bisht contributed to the report from New Delhi",Ayodhya Ram Mandir,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/9/30/indian-court-acquits-all-accused-in-babri-mosque-demolition-case,AL JAZEERA,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""tonality"", ""reason"": ""The article presents a balanced view of the acquittal verdict, but some quotes and descriptions have a subtle tone favoring the Muslim community's perspective.

188,Fury at Indian PM’s temple plans,"Vajpayee, who heads the Hindu nationalist BJP party, said on Friday at the funeral of Ramchandra Paramhans that he would fulfil the 93-year-old priest’s dying wish to build a temple in the northern city of Ayodhya at the reputed birthplace of the god Ram, where a mosque was built in the 16th century.In 1992 Hindu zealots led by Vajpayee’s then-opposition BJP tore down the Babri mosque, setting off nationwide riots that left more than 2,000 dead. The dispute over the site is now before the courts.Congress party spokesman S.

189,Mosque-temple spat: Why has India’s Sambhal exploded into violent clashes?,"New Delhi, India — When Nayeem Ahmad, 35, left his sweets shop on Sunday morning to buy cooking oil, his younger brother, Tasleem, did not know that interreligious tensions were boiling over in Sambhal, their hometown in northern India’s Uttar Pradesh state.Within a few minutes, Tasleem received a phone call he will never forget: “My elder brother was shot dead by the police in daylight.”Protests had broken out in Sambhal on Sunday morning after a local court ordered an archaeological survey of a 16th-century mosque, the Shahi Jama Masjid, acting on a petition claiming that a Hindu temple once stood in its place.Amid clashes with the police, at least five people have died from bullet injuries. The families of the victims and other protesters accuse the police of shooting them dead. The police, in turn, say “miscreants opened fire” and they “are investigating the source of the gunfire”.After the violence, the district authorities snapped the internet, ordered the closure of schools, and barred entry of any outsider as markets remained shut amid a police crackdown and curfew-like situation, locals told Al Jazeera.So, what triggered the protests in Uttar Pradesh, India’s biggest state; how unique is the claim of a mosque being built over a temple, and why do some senior lawyers blame the country’s top court for all of this?Over the past three years, Hindu nationalist groups and activists have flooded the Indian judiciary with petitions across several states, alleging that Muslim religious sites are built on razed Hindu temples.On November 19, a local court in Sambhal heard one such petition, which claimed that a Harihar Temple was converted into a mosque in 1529, pleading that the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) ought “to manage and to have complete control” over the site.The court ordered a survey of the mosque premises, which took place on the same day. The team, however, returned for a second visit in the early hours of Sunday morning, and “the news spread panic quickly across the town”, Mashood Ali Farooqui, an advocate who was part of the survey team, told Al Jazeera.“Misinformation spread quickly that the survey team was digging inside the mosque, and it triggered the crowd gathered around the mosque,” he said, adding that from his experiences, “we found nothing out of place or contradicting evidence”.Some activists accompanying the survey team also raised Hindu nationalist slogans, said Farooqui, adding “it was an irresponsible act that worsened the situation”.The plaintiffs in this case, led by advocate Vishnu Shankar Jain, are also behind several similar petitions claiming there were temples where some mosques stand today in the Uttar Pradesh cities of Varanasi, Mathura, and Agra. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Hindu majoritarian Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) rules Uttar Pradesh.The Shahi Jama Masjid enjoys the official status of a “protected monument” and has been earlier declared a “monument of national importance”. It is among the three significant mosques — two others being in Haryana state’s Panipat and the demolished Babri Masjid in Ayodhya, Uttar Pradesh — built during Mughal Emperor Babur’s reign.In 1991, India’s Parliament passed the Places of Worship Act. That law essentially laid down that the religious character of all places of worship would remain the same as it was on August 15, 1947 — when British India was divided into India and Pakistan — and could not be changed.The trigger for the law was the mass mobilisation campaign led by the BJP’s leaders to bring tens of thousands of activists to the city of Ayodhya to demand that a temple be built at the site of the historic Babri Masjid. Ayodhya, according to Hindu scriptures, was the birthplace of God Ram, and far-right Hindu activists have long alleged that the mosque was built on a demolished Ram temple.The law could not stop a mob from tearing down the mosque in 1992. But in 2019, while awarding the land on which the mosque once stood to a trust to build a temple — and allotting a patch of land elsewhere for the construction of a mosque — the Supreme Court of India upheld the Places of Worship Act, making it clear that the “court cannot entertain claims that stem from the actions of Mughal rulers against Hindu places of worship today”.However, when a similar mosque-atop-temple case, from Varanasi, Modi’s parliamentary constituency, reached the Supreme Court in May 2022, the court of then Chief Justice DY Chandrachud allowed an archaeological survey.While noting that there could be no conversion of the place, Chandrachud said the structure’s “original character” could always be determined. Later that month, a local court in Mathura admitted a plea seeking the transfer of the land of the Shahi Idgah mosque in the city to a Hindu trust for the construction of a temple to God Krishna.“It was a really dangerous flip-flop by the chief justice,” said Colin Gonsalves, a senior lawyer and founder of the Human Rights Law Network. “It has opened floodgates of similar pleas that threaten the status of Muslims in India.”Since then, many such cases have been filed, often supported by lawmakers of the BJP.“By closing the Ayodhya verdict, the top court had believed that it has pushed the genie of communal majoritarianism back in the bottle,” said Sanjay Hegde, a senior Supreme Court lawyer.However, Chandrachud’s “unguarded comments in the Varanasi case, which were not even sought by counsel for the parties, stoked the fires across the country and the genie resurfaced with fresh claims”, Hegde added.Nadeem Khan, the national secretary of the Association for Protection of Civil Rights (APCR), an advocacy group that is in Sambhal on a fact-finding mission, told Al Jazeera that the “survey of mosques has turned into an instrument of political strength”.“The Muslim community fears that these surveys will lead to losses of their places of worship,” Khan told Al Jazeera. “Because of Chandrachud’s comments, people are losing their lives on the streets. The Supreme Court opened this Pandora’s box and paved the path for further hooliganism.”Gonsalves, the lawyer, recalled being shocked by Chandrachud’s comments when the Varanasi case reached the top court.“Instead of putting out the fire immediately, now the fires are burning everywhere in India,” he said. “The judiciary allowed the communal forces a kind of licence to take the law into their own hands.”Back at their small home in Sambhal, Tasleem is attending to mourners after his elder brother, Nayeem’s death. Nayeem is survived by his wife and four children, the eldest being 10 years old. “My brother was not among the protesters and yet the police killed him,” he told Al Jazeera.“Who should we ask for justice now?”",Ayodhya Ram Mandir,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/11/25/mosque-temple-spat-why-has-indias-sambhal-exploded-into-violent-clashes,AL JAZEERA,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""source"", ""reason"": ""The article relies heavily on sources critical of the Indian government and Hindu nationalist groups, such as Colin Gonsalves and Sanjay Hegde, while underrepresenting or not mentioning opposing views."", ""confidence"": 0.8}",yes,source,"relies heavily on sources critical of the Indian government and Hindu nationalist groups, such as Colin Gonsalves and Sanjay Hegde, while underrepresenting or not mentioning opposing views."

A total of 18 petitions were heard by the court.“We have carefully gone through the review petitions and the connected papers filed therewith.

191,"In Modi’s constituency Varanasi, India’s next temple-mosque spat explodes","Varanasi/Bengaluru, India – A festive atmosphere engulfed Varanasi, one of Hinduism’s holiest cities situated on the banks of the river Ganga.It was the week Prime Minister Narendra Modi had inaugurated the new temple to the Hindu deity Ram where the 16th century Babri Masjid once stood in the city of Ayodhya, 200km (124 miles) to the north.In Varanasi, the streets and boats on the river were decked up with saffron flags bearing illustrations of Ram. Outside Varanasi’s famous and historic Kashi Vishwanath temple, the smell of burning camphor and the sound of Indian classical music drifted through the air as pilgrims flocked in large numbers to the temple to offer their prayers.But next door, towards the west of the temple, the carnival-like spirit was replaced with a strict and sombre atmosphere, with barricades and police officers greeting crowds.The officers were guarding the Gyanvapi Mosque – which is widely believed to have been built on the ruins of a 16th-century Kashi Vishwanath temple demolished by Mughal emperor Aurangzeb in 1669.While the partially ruined Kashi temple has been reconstructed and stands adjacent to the Gyanvapi Mosque, Hindu supremacist groups have been trying to reclaim the mosque for decades.In May 2022, some Hindu patrons went to the Varanasi local court asking for permission to worship within the mosque’s complex after a court-ordered video survey found that a ‘Shivling’ – a symbol of the Hindu deity Shiva – was found near the wuzukhana, a well used by Muslim devotees at the mosque.This case gained momentum in January this year when a survey from the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), among other things, stated that a large Hindu temple existed on the site before the mosque and that sculptures of Hindu deities were also present in the cellars of the mosque.Within a few days, on January 31, Judge Ajaya Krishna Vishvesha from Varanasi’s local court passed an order ruling that Hindus would be allowed to pray in the mosque’s basement – a section which had been sealed due to security concerns.“District court Varanasi has created history today,” Vishnu Jain, a Supreme Court lawyer representing the Hindu side said in a post on X.A day later, videos and images began appearing on social media of a priest offering prayers to the Hindu deities inside the mosque cellar.#WATCH | A priest offers prayers at 'Vyas Ji ka Tehkhana' inside Gyanvapi mosque in Varanasi, after District court order.Visuals confirmed by Vishnu Shankar Jain, the lawyer for the Hindu side in the Gyanvapi case pic.twitter.com/mUB6TMGpET— ANI (@ANI) February 1, 2024The Anjuman Intezamia Masajid, the committee managing the Gyanvapi Mosque, rejected the local court’s order and is scheduled to challenge the case at the Allahabad High Court in the city of Prayagraj, formerly known as Allahabad, on February 6.“It seems like the judicial system is against Muslims,” Rais Ahmad Ansari, an advocate in Varanasi representing the Muslim side, told Al Jazeera.Even amid a heightened momentum among India’s Hindu supremacist movement to target mosques, often facilitated by government authorities – a centuries-old mosque was razed in New Delhi last week – the case involving the Gyanyavi structure holds deep political significance. Varanasi is the electoral constituency of Modi, who leads the Hindu majoritarian Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) that rules the country, yet has built strong relations with the presidents and ministers of Western liberal democracies.India will vote in general elections expected to be held between March and May.While the court order hasn’t stirred any violence or communal riots, a sense of anxiety is prevalent in the Muslim neighbourhoods of the city, according to advocate Ansari.“Muslim-owned shops closed after the [January 31] hearing fearing a dispute. Friday’s namaz [prayers] was also greeted with tight security presence as hundreds gathered outside the Gynavapi Mosque to offer prayers. There is a sense of anxiety in every Muslim’s mind,” he said.“It is still peaceful in Varanasi. But this peace feels uneasy,” he added.Meanwhile, some news channels in the country hailed the local court order and the onset of prayers in the mosque as “a big win for Hindus” – a sentiment shared by several Hindus in Varanasi.“We plan to go visit the site and see the priest performing rituals at the mosque as soon as our exams end,” Ayush Akash and Harshit Sharma, two 21-year-old political science students at the Banaras Hindu University (BHU), told Al Jazeera.Nita*, a Hindu devotee at the Kashi Vishwanath temple, was also keen to pray at the temple.“We feel great about it [court ruling]. If we are let to visit and pray, we will go. When Hindus pray in Varanasi, they have their own places of worship. My brother is a priest and can only worship in his temple. But if the priest allows us into Gyanvapi, we will surely go,” she told Al Jazeera.“People here have been going crazy since the inauguration of the Ayodhya temple,” Nita said.“You can feel a Hindu vibe all around you on the streets. It was never like this before, but everybody is happy about things that are happening and that the Gyanvapi is a Hindu temple,” she added.BHU’s Akash pointed out that people from all religions in Varanasi have coexisted peacefully for years and are mature enough not to riot over the temple-mosque dispute.“It might look like Hindus are in power, and yes, some Muslim people might be unhappy about the local court’s decision on the Gyanvapi Mosque. But in this city, while ideologies do differ, it doesn’t stop Hindu-Muslim friendship. That’s how the real Varanasi is,” he said.Since Modi came to power in 2014, critics and rights groups have accused his government of encouraging or facilitating a rise in Hindu supremacy, while instances of discrimination and violence against Muslims – who represent the largest religious minority in the country – have grown.Hindu nationalist groups have also increasingly launched or intensified legal campaigns against several centuries-old mosques, claiming they are built on the remains of Hindu shrines.“There is a slogan which Hindu nationalists have been using which says ‘Ayodhya Jhaki hain, Kashi-Mathura Baki Hain,'” said BHU’s Akash. Translated, the slogan says ‘Ayodhya is just a preview, Kashi [Varanasi] and Mathura are left’. It’s a reference to how the demolition of the Babri Masjid in 1992 in Ayodhya has been used by Hindu majoritarian groups to seek similar actions with the Mughal-era mosques in Varanasi and Mathura.“But right now, in Varanasi, the Gyanvapi case is all about politics. It seems like the local court gave its ruling in time for the upcoming general elections. I feel the ruling is to unite Hindus before the elections,” he said.Syed Ali Nadeem Rezavi, secretary of the Indian History Congress and professor of medieval history at the Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) shared a similar view but highlighted that this case is not like Ayodhya.“Nobody has ever said that where the Gyanvapi Mosque stands today, there had been no temple. It is clear there was a temple and it was demolished. One can even see that with the naked eye,” Rezavi said.“The reason behind why the temple was broken is where the contention arises since the manner in which the history of temple demolitions is currently being presented is a false narrative.”Rezavi highlighted how the book, Temple Desecration and Muslim States in Medieval India, written by American scholar Richard Eaton, explains that in pre-colonial India, every dynasty had a deity they prayed to. If the ruler of the dynasty was defeated and the kingdom was taken over, then the deity and everything devoted to the deity – including the temple – was destroyed by the triumphant ruler.“This was an accepted practice among kings and is exactly what [the emperor] Aurangzeb did. But the reason behind why he demolished the Vishwanath temple and built the mosque has many theories with some historians saying it was due to religious reasons and others claiming it was Aurangzeb’s way of punishing the Hindu family who managed the mosque since they had helped the Hindu king Shivaji escape,” he added.“What Aurangzeb did should be condemned. But he lived during an era when there was no constitution. We have an Indian constitution which guarantees certain rights to people. So I don’t understand why the courts and prime minister are ignoring this and committing a crime more heinous than Aurangzeb,” Rezavi said.Constitutionally, India is a secular state. The country also passed a law in 1991 called the Places of Worship Act, which prohibits the conversion of places of worship and stresses that their religious nature should be maintained.But the final say about the future of the mosque lies with the country’s courts.Abhishek Sharma, a Kashi temple devotee and coordinator at the Swagatam Kashi Foundation, told Al Jazeera that “people in Varanasi believe in ‘Ganga-Jamuna tehzeeb’,” a metaphor for social harmony that references the mingling of the waters of the Ganga and Yamuna rivers.“We have always believed in living together in sanctity.  We pray that this peace is not disturbed in any way,” he said.*Some names have been changed to protect identities.",Ayodhya Ram Mandir,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/6/in-modis-constituency-varanasi-indias-next-temple-mosque-spat-explodes,AL JAZEERA,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""framing"", ""reason"": ""The article frames the issue as a 'temple-mosque spat' and highlights Hindu supremacist groups' efforts to reclaim the mosque, while also presenting Muslim concerns as 'anxiety' and 'unease'.

192,How dubious YouTube ‘news’ channels are boosting Modi in India’s election,"Mumbai, India – On one channel, a male journalist chastises an Indian Muslim man sympathetic with Palestinians, asking him: “Did you stand with Hindus when they suffered atrocities in Pakistan and Afghanistan?”On another channel, a journalist gleefully asks a Muslim resident of the city of Ayodhya whether Muslims were happy that a Ram temple had come up on the site of a centuries-old mosque demolished by a Hindu nationalist mob.A female anchor on yet another channel alleges that a conspiracy is afoot to make India’s southern state of Kerala an ‘Islamic State’, with the hub of this conspiracy being Wayanad, the parliamentary constituency of opposition leader Rahul Gandhi, quoting no evidence to substantiate her allegation.India, with over 460 million users, is YouTube’s largest market, with four out of five internet users in India consuming its content. Increasingly, more and more Indians are getting their news from YouTube.What is on offer, though, is not always news. Some of the most popular YouTube news channels in India are increasingly offering a smattering of disinformation and Islamophobia, often cheerleading Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his party, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) while targeting its critics and opposition leaders.While partisan YouTube influencers making political content in favour of either side of the political divide is a common phenomenon, what makes these channels unique is that they claim to be ‘news’ channels, ostensibly presenting fact-based reportage.From mocking and attacking Modi’s rival politicians to peddling conspiracy theories about Muslims trying to harm Hindus, these channels often complement the BJP’s own campaign efforts.These channels, though lesser known than mainstream news channels, have millions of viewers, giving them an outsized role in how the world’s largest democracy is consuming news as India prepares for its national election.For instance, NMF News, which ranks among India’s top 100 YouTube news and politics channels, has over 18.2 million subscribers with over 8.1 billion views. Headlines India, with over 8.83 million subscribers has nearly 3 billion views; Rajdharma News, with its 3.2 million subscribers has nearly 0.9 billion views.With such a wide reach, concerns around how such ‘news’ outlets might shape perceptions and opinions – especially in election season – are rising.Studies have shown that Indians place greater trust in news they view on YouTube and WhatsApp, over news delivered by mainstream media outlets, even though many have warned of YouTube’s role in promoting disinformation. Already, the World Economic Forum’s 2024 Global Risk Report has concluded that the most severe risk India faces is the fallout from the spread of false information.Most of these channels, surveyed for this piece, routinely stoked disinformation against Muslims, dissenters and critics of Modi and the BJP, in the guise of reporting ‘news’.NMF News denied allegations of such a bias but insisted that it was the “fastest-growing” channel, which was “sometimes right-wing” in its approach, but was always “fact-based”, according to Pankaj Prasoon, the bureau chief of NMF News in the eastern Indian state of Jharkhand. Headlines India and Rajdharma News did not respond, despite repeated requests for comments over publicly listed emails.As election campaigning heats up in India, so too is the disinformation on these channels.On March 13, NMF News published a three-minute-long report on its channel on one of India’s premier-most universities, the public-funded Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) in New Delhi. JNU has been in the cross-hairs of the Modi government owing to its left-leaning student politics, with it often being dubbed as an ‘anti-national’ space by many Modi supporters.NMF’s news report, titled ‘No More Sloganeering in the Anti-National Hub of JNU’, rehashes and echoes this political rhetoric. It laments how the university had, over time, become “the hub of antinational activities”, attributing it to “the rapid spread of leftist thought”, before going on to plug an upcoming film titled JNU, which depicts the politics on campus and has a revealing tagline: “Can One Educational University Break the Nation?”Another story is titled Amit Shah’s Solid Action Leaves Rahul In Shivers, with a thumbnail image of close Modi aide and Home Minister Amit Shah, while Rahul Gandhi is shown with folded hands. Yet another video mocks Gandhi over his recent journey crisscrossing the country to meet supporters.NMF is not alone. A study done by Narrative Research Lab, a New Delhi-based data lab that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to track print media and social media content, analysed the content across six channels – NMF, Rajdharma, Headlines India, Shining India, Capital TV and O News Hindi – and found that coverage of India’s opposition parties was muted and its leaders were rendered almost invisible. In contrast, Modi and the BJP loomed large, their coverage almost always glowing.The lab analysed 2,747 videos published by these channels between December 22, 2023, and March 22, 2024. In their findings, the lab found that across all the channels, some of the most frequently used words in the titles were “Modi”, “BJP” and “Yogi”, referring to the hardline BJP chief minister of Uttar Pradesh state, Yogi Adityanath, while mentions of opposition parties and leaders were used scarcely.A “sentiment analysis” by the lab found that while “Modi” was used commonly across videos that had both negative and positive sentiments, references to India’s opposition figures like Gandhi mostly emerged in negative phrases.Sundeep Narwani, the co-founder of the Narrative Research Lab, said these channels served a useful purpose as “vehicles” for negative targeting.“These channels have become easy ways of targeting Modi’s critics and opposition leaders,” Narwani said. “Often, political parties might not want to engage in such negative targeting, so such channels become easy vehicles to do so.”Independent journalist Neel Madhav, who co-authored an award-winning investigation into the functioning of these channels for the New Delhi-based Caravan magazine, said many of these channels were “an integral part” of the BJP’s social media messaging.“Very often, BJP social media handles post videos from these channels,” he said. “In addition, BJP sympathisers use the party’s social media apparatus to disseminate these videos among their cadres,” he said, thereby helping the channels amplify their reach and, as a result, generate revenue from clicks and views.At least four of these channels – Rajdharma News, Headlines India, Shining India and Capital TV – were provided access to interview Chief Minister Adityanath in the run-up to the Uttar Pradesh state elections in 2022.Routinely, these channels amplify Islamophobic sentiments and use anti-Muslim tropes.Days before Modi consecrated a temple to the Hindu god Ram in Ayodhya, built on the site of a centuries-old mosque demolished by a mob of Hindu nationalists in 1992, a reporter from Rajdharma News interviewed Muslims near the site with leading questions.“People are saying Muslims are very happy about the temple being constructed and that they will celebrate its consecration like it is Diwali. Is that true?” the reporter asked, referring to the popular Hindu festival.Close to 2,500 people died (PDF) in violence in the early 1990s during the BJP-led movement to build a temple at the spot. Yet, the reporter asks provocative questions to Muslims in the city. “Some Muslims say that Ram was their ancestor, too,” the reporter added. “Do you think Muslims will maintain peace on January 22?” he asks another, referring to the day of the consecration of the temple.In July last year, sectarian violence between Hindu and Muslim communities hit parts of the northern state of Haryana. Reporting on the riots, another Rajdharma reporter walked up to an elderly Muslim man and asked him if he wasn’t feeling well. When he responded in the affirmative, she lashed out, tauntingly: “Why? Did you work too hard on July 31?” referring to the day of the clashes.“Tell me one thing, wherever Hindus are in a majority and Muslims are in a tiny minority, we, Hindus, do everything to make them [Muslims] feel like kings,” she went on. “Why do you guys threaten and intimidate Hindus, why do you trouble them so much?” The video was circulated widely on social media platforms and garnered nearly 780,000 views on YouTube alone.NMF News, on March 13, published a video titled, A Part of the Country Where Hindu Women Are Delivering Muslim Children. In it, the anchor, Namrata Chaudhari, alleged that “Muslim infiltrators” were luring tribal women into marriage in eastern state Jharkhand’s Dumka region and then “capturing tribal lands”.“There is also a lot of talk of love jihad …”, where she quotes one news report of a case where a Muslim man in Jharkhand killed his second wife after marital discord. “What is happening in Jharkhand?” she asks.Prasoon, the NMF bureau chief, in the video insists that Muslims had upturned the area’s population demographics.“In 2011, Muslims were just 10, 11 percent, whereas tribals were 35 percent. But by 2022, there has been a role reversal, Muslims are now 35 percent and tribals are just 10, 11 percent,” he said, echoing an evidence-free conspiracy theory about Muslims plotting to outnumber Hindus in India.Prasoon, speaking to Al Jazeera, could not provide a source for this claim that Muslims had outnumbered tribals. When pointed out that India has not held a census since 2011, Prasoon said the 2022 data he provided was based on “estimates” and said he “might” have quoted controversial BJP Member of Parliament Nishikant Dubey’s claims of such a demographic change. Dubey had, in December last year, blamed “illegal Bangladeshi immigrants” for causing such a demographic change in Jharkhand, without offering any evidence for the claim.In another video, Prasoon said ISIL (ISIS) was creating “colonies” in the Wayanad region of the southern Indian state of Kerala, where “even patriotic Muslims” were not allowed entry. The Wayanad police refuted such claims and had even prosecuted another web portal for spreading such “false information” about the region.Prasoon insisted in the video that Muslims and Christians made up to 80 percent of Wayanad’s population with Hindus in a minority – even though government data indicates that Hindus make up 49.5 percent of the region’s population, with Muslims at 28 percent.Prasoon, when questioned, said NMF uses local news reports in its reporting.“I don’t remember that video exactly, or where I got that figure from. I could have reported the latest population data from a source other than the Census,” he said, without naming the source, but insisted that his channel’s reporting was always factual. “NMF stands for News Means Facts, so we always make sure we have documentary proof for our claims,” he added.Madhav, the journalist who has reported on these YouTube channels, said such content is then used to bolster and reiterate the Hindu majoritarian agenda by right-wing groups.“These channels often feature stereotypical characters like a Muslim who hates other Muslims but loves Modi, or a Muslim woman who talks about atrocities on other Muslim women,” said Madhav.The Narrative Research Lab analysis also found that there was a spike in the number of videos these channels produced on events like the day the contentious Citizenship Amendment Act rules were announced on March 11. The rules expedite Indian citizenship for Hindus, Parsis, Buddhists, Jains and Christians from neighbouring Muslim countries but exclude Muslims from its domain.“The content trend observed here is that all the channels … have a similar audience base and that they might be trying to push and reiterate a certain uniform narrative on the issue,” said the lab’s Narwani.",Ayodhya Ram Mandir,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/4/5/how-dubious-youtube-news-channels-are-shaping-indias-election,AL JAZEERA,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""source"", ""reason"": ""The article relies heavily on counter-sources (narrative research lab, independent journalist Neel Madhav) that criticize the YouTube channels for promoting disinformation and Islamophobia, while underrepresenting or not"", ""confidence"": 0.8}",yes,source," relies heavily on counter-sources (narrative research lab, independent journalist Neel Madhav) that criticize the YouTube channels for promoting disinformation and Islamophobia"
193,At least five killed in protest over mosque demolition in north Indian town,"At least five people have been killed and dozens others injured during a protest sparked by the demolition of a mosque and a religious school in India, the latest in a spate of demolitions targeting Muslim structures.Municipal authorities in Haldwani town in the northern state of Uttarakhand bulldozed the buildings on Thursday, saying they had been built without permission.Police said Muslims torched vehicles and threw stones at them in the protest that followed, prompting them to fire live ammunition and tear gas in response.A top police official in Uttarakhand on Friday told The Indian Express newspaper five people were killed in the protest, but did not identify them. Dozens of others, including police officers, were wounded and are being treated in various hospitals of the city.Vandana Singh, the district magistrate of Nainital district, where Haldwani is located, said at a news conference the demolition and its aftermath were “not communal and should not be seen as such”.She said the protest was linked to a government drive to demolish a “property that is neither registered as religious site nor has it been given any such recognition”.“Some call the structure a madrassa,” she added.But residents said the mosque and the school in Haldwani’s Banphoolpura area were nearly two decades old and had been unfairly targeted, despite a court hearing on the matter scheduled on February 14.They also said all those killed in the police firing were Muslim.“When the police arrived with bulldozers, the men were at work. When the women protested the demolition, the police batoncharged and teargassed us,” Najma Khanum, 21, a resident of Malik Ka Bagicha in Banbhoolpura told Al Jazeera.Authorities in Haldwani have given shoot-on-sight orders, imposed a curfew, suspended internet services, closed schools and banned large gatherings.Sumit Hridayesh, a state legislator from the opposition Indian National Congress party who represents Haldwani, said the violence was a result of “hasty action” by the administration. He said locals in the area, including Muslim leaders, should have been notified before the demolition was carried out.Uttarakhand’s chief minister, Pushkar Singh Dhami, said the government would take the “strictest action against rioters and miscreants”.“Police have been given clear instructions to deal strictly with unruly elements,” he said in a statement. “Every rioter who indulged in arson and stone pelting is being identified. No miscreant who disturbs harmony and peace will be spared.”In January last year, there were widespread protests in Haldwani, a Himalayan town about 270km (170 miles) northeast of New Delhi, after authorities ordered the demolition of nearly 4,000 homes that had allegedly encroached on land owned by the state-run railways.The drive was stayed by the Supreme Court, which said 50,000 people “cannot be uprooted overnight”.Hindu supremacist groups have been emboldened in their campaign against Muslims and their religious structures since Prime Minister Narendra Modi took office a decade ago.Last month, Modi inaugurated a Hindu temple in the northern city of Ayodhya, built on the site of a centuries-old Mughal-era mosque that was destroyed by Hindu zealots in 1992.Muslim groups have also accused governments controlled by Modi’s Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) of using bulldozers to illegally demolish the homes and businesses of people accused of violence.In two reports published together this week, the human rights group Amnesty International documented the “punitive” demolition of at least 128 Muslim properties from April to June 2022, rendering at least 617 people either homeless or without livelihoods.“The unlawful demolition of Muslim properties by the Indian authorities, peddled as ‘bulldozer justice’ by political leaders and media, is cruel and appalling. … They are destroying families – and must stop immediately,” Agnes Callamard, Amnesty International’s secretary-general, said in a statement on Wednesday.Rights groups have also accused Modi of looking the other way and sometimes enabling hate speech against Muslims, who comprise 14 percent of India’s 1.4 billion people.

194,Muslims and Hindus discuss mosque dispute,"The 51-member executive committee of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) will hold talks on proposals from Hindu religious leader Swami Jayendra Saraswati.The meeting will be held in Lucknow, the capital of Uttar Pradesh state.The proposals are the most serious attempts so far to reach a settlement between Hindus and Muslims.Both Hindus and Muslims claim the piece of land in Ayodhya on which the 16th-century Babri mosque once stood.The mosque was destroyed on 6 December, 1992 by thousands of Hindus.The crowd that destroyed the mosque was led by right-wing Hindu nationalist BJP party and its affiliates.They said the mosque was built on the site of a Hindu temple, marking the birthplace of the warrior god Ram.The demolition triggered nationwide violent protests between Hindus and Muslims.At least 2,000 people were killed and hundreds of thousands were left homeless.Hindus launched a campaign on the mid-1980s to have a temple built at the site while Muslims want the mosque to be rebuilt.A court looking into the issue has ordered archaeologists to examine whether a temple had existed beneath the mosque.But Muslim and Hindu leaders have been holding behind-the-scenes talks to reach a compromise out of court.Proposals consideredSaraswati’s proposals have not been made available to the public.But media reports and government sources say the first offer is that Hindus take the Ayodhya land.In return, Muslims receive land five kilometers away to build a mosque with the help of the government.As part of the offer, Hindus would abandon claims in similar disputes at Kashi and Mathura cities in Uttar Pradesh.Another proposal suggests the construction of both a mosque and a temple at the site to be separated by a body of water.A third proposal calls for a wall to be built between a mosque and a temple with no construction taking place on the disputed site until the court’s verdict.“I am very sure a solution will be found by July 6”, Saraswati said.",Ayodhya Ram Mandir,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2003/7/5/muslims-and-hindus-discuss-mosque-dispute,AL JAZEERA,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""omission"", ""reason"": ""The article does not mention the current status of the court's verdict or any potential obstacles to reaching a settlement, which could be considered a key fact for fair understanding."", ""confidence"": 0.8}",yes,omission,"does not mention the current status of the court's verdict or any potential obstacles to reaching a settlement, which could be considered a key fact for fair understanding"
195,Leading BJP figures to face trial in Babri mosque case,"India’s Supreme Court has ordered that the cofounder of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, LK Advani, and other leaders be tried for criminal conspiracy in the demolition of a 16th century mosque about 25 years ago.The Babri Masjid in Ayodhya, in the northern Uttar Pradesh state, was pulled down by Hindu activists on December 6, 1992, leading to widespread riots in which more than 2,000 people died.Advani, 89, along with Murli Manohar Joshi and Uma Bharti, has previously been charged with making inflammatory speeches which incited the activists to demolish the structure.The Supreme Court’s ruling on Wednesday came after a lower court dropped the charges brought against them by India’s Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), kicking off a series of appeals and counter appeals.“We have allowed the CBI appeal against the Allahabad High Court judgment with certain directions,” the Press Trust of India news agency quoted the Supreme Court judges as saying.The court ruled that the leaders will face the more serious charge of conspiracy and be tried by a special court in Lucknow dealing with the actual demolition of the mosque, Zafaryab Jilani, a lawyer for the petitioner, said on Wednesday.“The judges set aside previous court orders that dropped conspiracy charges against these leaders. It accepted appeals by the prosecution and on our behalf to revive the charges,” Jilani said.While combining the trials, the Supreme Court ordered daily hearings to ensure the verdict is delivered in two years’ time.“There are many witnesses in the case. We hope the guilty are punished,” Jilani, who is also the convenor of the Babri Masjid Action Committee, said.The Supreme Court ruled that a fourth senior BJP politician, Kalyan Singh, who was chief minister of Uttar Pradesh at the time of the incident, should face criminal conspiracy charges.His trial, however, will be delayed until his stint as governor of Rajasthan state is over because the position gives him immunity from prosecution.The site where the Babri mosque was demolished has remained a flashpoint of religious tensions for decades.Some Hindus say a temple to their god Ram predated the mosque and want to build a temple at the site, while Muslim groups want a new mosque.Some in the BJP, which recently won elections in Uttar Pradesh, want to build a temple to Ram on the ruins of the razed Babri mosque – an idea that horrifies the state’s significant Muslim minority.Indian new media reports said the charges would ruin the chances of Advani, a former prime minister, becoming India’s next president when the role becomes vacant later this year.He was present on the day of the demolition. The ensuing nationwide riots and deaths came to define his political career.However, in a later interview with the BBC, he said the incident had hurt him “tremendously” and should never have happened.There was no immediate reaction from the BJP, to which Narendra Modi, India’s prime minister, belongs.However, the opposition Congress party said that the BJP had “tried every trick in the book” to ensure that Advani, Bharti and Joshi did not face charges.“What they [Supreme Court judges] have said today means there’s clinching evidence that needs to be now argued out in the court,” said Sanjay Jha, a Congress spokesman.The mosque demolition case has been languishing in India’s sluggish legal system for almost 25 years.",Ayodhya Ram Mandir,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/4/19/leading-bjp-figures-to-face-trial-in-babri-mosque-case,AL JAZEERA,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""labeling"", ""reason"": ""Loaded label 'horrifies' applied asymmetrically to Muslim minority's reaction, while Advani's presence and hurtful statement are presented without similar loaded language."", ""confidence"": 0.8}",yes,labelling,"label 'horrifies' applied asymmetrically to Muslim minority's reaction, while Advani's presence and hurtful statement are presented without similar loaded language"
196,India cracks down on social media after religious-site ruling,"Dozens of people in India were detained on suspicion of publishing inflammatory social media posts and setting off celebratory firecrackers after the Supreme Court ruled to give a disputed religious site to Hindus.Authorities said they were showing a “zero-tolerance approach” towards potentially inflammatory content on YouTube, Twitter, Facebook and WhatsApp.About 47 people were arrested as of late Sunday in Uttar Pradesh, India’s most populous state and the site of the contested land, state police said on Sunday.Police have acted upon 7,681 social media posts across the state by either reporting them to the platform or asking users to delete them.“Any illegal conduct on the internet will be noticed and acted upon,” said PV Rama Sastry, a director general of police in Uttar Pradesh’s capital Lucknow.The Supreme Court awarded the bitterly contested site in the northern town of Ayodhya to Hindus on Saturday, dealing a defeat to Muslims who also claim the land that has sparked some of the country’s bloodiest riots since independence.In 1992, a Hindu mob destroyed the 16th-century Babri Mosque on the site, triggering riots in which about 2,000 people, mostly Muslims, were killed. No major violence was reported after the ruling over the weekend.The police also said they sealed a local office of right-wing Hindu nationalist group Akhil Bharat Hindu Mahasabha and detained its national vice president, Ashok Sharma. They did not provide further details.In another part of the state, at least seven men were arrested for setting off firecrackers or creating disturbances while distributing sweets in celebration.The home ministry did not immediately respond to a request for information on arrests.The government has deployed thousands of members of paramilitary forces and police in Ayodhya and other sensitive places.The court’s decision paves the way for the construction of a Hindu temple on the site, a proposal long supported by Prime Minister Narendra Modi‘s ruling Hindu-nationalist party.Hindus believe the site is the birthplace of Lord Ram, a physical incarnation of the Hindu god Vishnu, and say the site was holy for Hindus long before the Muslim Mughals, India’s most prominent Islamic rulers, built the Babri Mosque there in 1528.The Supreme Court called the 1992 demolition of the mosque illegal but handed the 2.77-acre (1.1-hectare) plot – about the size of a football field – to a Hindu group.It directed that another plot in Ayodhya be provided to a Muslim group that had contested the case.Some scholars and activists saw the judgement as unfair, particularly given that the 1992 razing of the mosque was deemed illegal.“Why has the 2.77 acres been gifted to the very elements who were party to this?” Syeda Hameed, the president of the Muslim Women’s Forum, wrote in the Hindustan Times, referring to the mosque’s destruction.Muslim leaders have called for peace between majority Hindus and Muslims, who constitute 14 percent of its 1.3 billion people.Some seemed to have resigned themselves to the decision.“I am disheartened with the verdict and leaving it to Allah,” said Mohammad Azam Qadri, a community leader in Ayodhya.",Ayodhya Ram Mandir,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/11/10/india-cracks-down-on-social-media-after-religious-site-ruling,AL JAZEERA,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""framing"", ""reason"": ""The article frames the government's actions as a 'crackdown' and implies that social media posts are inflammatory, while not providing context or evidence of actual harm.

197,India: Century-old mosque razed in defiance of court order,"Officials in India’s northern state of Uttar Pradesh have allegedly bulldozed an old mosque, triggering anger and anguish among the Muslim minority, with a prominent community organisation saying it will approach the high court over the matter.The Ghareeb Nawaz Al Maroof Mosque, which residents in the state’s Barabanki district say was nearly 100 years old, was demolished on Monday evening by the local administration after hundreds of policemen surrounded the area and halted the movement of people to prevent any protest.Since 2017, Uttar Pradesh – India’s most populous state with nearly 220 million residents, almost one-fifth of them Muslim – is governed by the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), with a controversial saffron-robed monk Yogi Adityanath, known for his anti-Muslim hate speech, as the state’s chief minister.On Tuesday, the Uttar Pradesh Sunni Central Waqf Board, a Muslim body that looks after mosques and other community assets in the state, condemned the demolition and said it was done in defiance of a court order to halt demolitions of alleged “illegal structures” until May 31 in view of the coronavirus pandemic.In a statement, the board termed the act an “illegal and high-handed action of the administration” and said it will seek judicial remedy.“This act is against the law, misuse of power and utter violation of clear orders passed by the high court. We will immediately approach the high court demanding restoration of the mosque, high-level judicial inquiry and action against the guilty officers,” the board’s chairman Zufar Ahmad Faruqi said.In another statement, Maulana Khalid Saifullah Rehmani, general secretary of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB), said the demolition was undertaken “without any legal justification”.Syed Farooq Ahmad, a 28-year-old law student and social activist based in Uttar Pradesh, told Al Jazeera the administration had barred prayers in the mosque for the past month.“On March 15 this year, the administration sent a show-cause notice to the mosque committee, mentioning a high court order that illegal religious constructions are to be demolished that cause traffic disruption,” Ahmad said.According to Ahmad, the identification number of the plot of land mentioned in the show-cause notice did not belong to the mosque. He claimed the mosque was more than 100 feet away from the road and did not disrupt any traffic.“The mosque committee filed a counter reply with all the facts but that was not considered or taken on the record,” he said.Interestingly, Barabanki district’s magistrate Adarsh Singh told Al Jazeera “no mosque has been demolished”.Earlier, a press note issued by the district administration said an “illegal residential complex” was built in front of the residence of a government official and “the concerned parties” were sent a notice. The note claimed that as soon as the notice was served, the people residing in the residential complex in question fled the premises.But the local residents say the administration began building a wall to barricade the entrance of the mosque on March 19, leading to protests in which many were beaten and even arrested.“People who opposed them were beaten and detained. They were charged under different cases to scare them,” said Ahmad. “They arrested nearly 30 people. The Muslims in the locality were terrorised and many fled.”After the Muslims were “completely silenced”, as Ahmad put it, the whole area around the mosque was circled by police on Monday, all movement halted and the mosque demolished in the evening, its debris thrown in a river nearby.“People did not even open their windows during the demolition. There was so much fear that people did not even utter a word,” Ahmad said.Hindu-majority India has a long history of disputes over religious structures, mainly the ones built during Mughal rule from the 16th century to the early 19th century. Most of these structures are in Uttar Pradesh state.Barely 100km (62 miles) from Barabanki lies the town of Ayodhya, where a 16th-century mosque was demolished in 1992 by right-wing Hindus who claimed the structure stood at the exact place where Lord Ram, a Hindu deity, was born.The demolition of Babri Mosque catapulted the BJP – until then a marginal party – to political prominence, despite some of its leaders charged with hatching a conspiracy to take down the mosque.In November 2019, India’s Supreme Court handed over the disputed site in Ayodhya to Hindu claimants, allowing the construction of a Ram temple under the government’s supervision.In August last year, as the COVID-19 pandemic raged across India, Prime Minister Narendra Modi flew down to Ayodhya and performed the ground-breaking ceremony for the new temple, planned to be inaugurated before the 2024 national elections.In April this year, a court in Varanasi – also Modi’s parliamentary constituency – passed an order related to a dispute over a centuries-old mosque and a temple situated next to each other in a case reminiscent of the Ayodhya dispute.The court’s decision followed petitions filed by Hindu right-wing groups which claimed that Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb demolished a portion of the Vishwanath temple to build the Gyanvapi Mosque in the 17th century.The disputes – often leading to violent riots – have left India’s minority Muslims anxious and worried.Maulana Abdul Mustafa, the head leader of Barabanki district, said the Ghareeb Nawaz Al Maroof Mosque in Barabanki was built during British rule and that the area’s Muslims are hurt by its demolition.“It (the mosque) is in the revenue records, it was all legal. People prayed in it for decades,” he told Al Jazeera. “This is an oppression of Muslims. Our religious sentiments have been wounded. Those who demolished it should be held accountable.”",Ayodhya Ram Mandir,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/5/19/mosque-razed-in-bjp-ruled-indian-state-muslim-body-to-move-court,AL JAZEERA,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""tonality"", ""reason"": ""The article's tone is critical and emotive towards the Indian government and Hindu nationalist groups, using words like 'defiance', 'anger', 'anguish', 'illegal', 'high-handed action', and 'oppression'.

198,India court allows survey of historic mosque to see if it stands on temple,"An Indian court has ruled that officials can conduct a scientific survey to determine if a 17th-century mosque in the country’s north was built over a Hindu temple.The Gyanvapi Mosque in Varanasi, a district Prime Minister Narendra Modi represents in parliament, is one of several mosques in Uttar Pradesh state that right-wing Hindu groups claim was built on top of Hindu temples allegedly demolished during the peak of Mughal rule from the 16th to the 18th century.The dispute over the mosque – adjacent to the Kashi Vishwanath Temple, a prominent place of worship for India’s 80 percent majority Hindu community – has intensified in recent years. Muslims make up nearly 14 percent of the country’s 1.4 billion people.Vishnu Shankar Jain, a lawyer representing the Hindu petitioners, said the Allahabad High Court in Uttar Pradesh on Thursday allowed the state-run Archaeological Survey of India to survey the structure without causing any damage to it.“Scientific survey is necessary in the interest of justice,” Live Law, an online portal for Indian legal news, cited Chief Justice Pritinker Diwaker as saying.The Muslim petitioners objected to the survey, saying it would damage the structure.Khalid Rasheed, a Muslim petitioner, said the mosque committee has the option to appeal Thursday’s decision in India’s Supreme Court.“We are hopeful that justice will be done as the mosque is 600 years old and Muslims have been praying there for long,” Rasheed told reporters.The Archeological Survey of India began the survey last month, but the project was halted by the Supreme Court to give time for an appeal.Earlier, five Hindu women sought permission from a court to perform Hindu rituals in one part of the mosque, saying a Hindu temple once stood on the site.A controversy arose over a structure claimed by the Hindu petitioners as a shivling, a symbol of the Hindu god Shiva. Muslims said it was part of a fountain in the wuzukhana, a small water reservoir used by Muslim devotees to perform ritual ablutions before offering prayers.The Muslim body, the Anjuman Intezamia Masjid Committee, which manages the Gyanvapi Mosque, contends that the survey is contrary to provisions of a 1991 Indian law protecting places of worship.The law states that the nature of all places of worship, except Ram Janmabhoomi–Babri Mosque in Ayodhya, shall be maintained as they were on August 15, 1947, and that it is illegal to convert such sites.A 16th-century Babri Masjid mosque in Ayodhya, a temple town in Uttar Pradesh, was demolished in 1992 by Hindu hardliners who claimed it stood on the exact spot where Lord Ram was born.The demolition sparked massive religious riots across India that led to the death of some 2,000 people.In 2019, India’s Supreme Court ruled in favour of a Hindu temple on the disputed religious ground and ordered that alternative land be given to Muslims to build a mosque.Hindu nationalists had been demanding a temple on the site in Ayodhya since the 1940s.

199,Mapping the results of the India election 2024,"With all of India’s 640 million votes counted following a six-week-long election, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), together with its National Democratic Alliance (NDA), has won a majority, despite a sharp reduction in their seat tally compared with the 2019 elections.Incumbent Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s governing BJP won 240 seats, falling short of the 272-mark that indicates a majority in the Lok Sabha, the lower house of India’s parliament, which has 543 seats in total. With its allies, the BJP has still secured 293 seats to win.The opposition INDIA alliance, led by Rahul Gandhi’s Indian National Congress (INC) party, won 232 seats, with the Congress winning 99 of those, increasing sharply from 2019, when the Congress won only 52 seats, and with its allies, in 91 constituencies.This year’s election numbers contrast dramatically with the 2019 results when the BJP-led NDA won 353 seats, 303 of which were secured by the BJP alone.The map below represents the 543 seats in India’s lower house of parliament. The winning party/alliance are shaded for each constituency.Each hexagon represents one seat, so densely populated but geographically small constituencies are shown equally with large districts to better reflect the democratic power in parliament. The geographical map is shown below for reference.Uttar Pradesh (UP), a state governed by the BJP since 2017, has a total of 80 parliamentary constituencies and is India’s most populous state with more than 240 million people. As such, it holds the key to determining who governs in New Delhi. Moreover, both Modi and Gandhi contested elections from different constituencies in the state.In 2019, the NDA won 64 seats from the state, of which the BJP alone grabbed 62. The Congress won only one seat, the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) won 10 and the Samajwadi Party (SP) got five.But the 2024 outcome looks very different. The SP won 37 seats and the Congress six – totalling 43 for the INDIA alliance.The BJP won 33 seats, while its allies secured three seats in UP. Most stunningly, the BJP lost in the Faizabad constituency, which is home to the Ram temple in Ayodhya, which Modi consecrated in January. The temple – built on the ruins of the Babri mosque, which was demolished by a Hindu mob in 1992 – was a centrepiece of the BJP’s campaign.The BJP and its allies suffered big losses in the western state of Maharashtra as the Congress and its partners made key gains.The INDIA alliance – which includes the Congress, as well as splintered groups of Shiv Sena and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) – won 30 of the state’s 48 seats. The Congress alone won 13 seats, while the BJP won nine.Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s BJP and its right-wing predecessors have grown from political obscurity to dominating India’s parliament.The BJP, which first came to power with a coalition government for just 13 days in 1996, subsequently ruled from 1998 to 2004.But in 2004, it suffered a shock loss to a Congress-led coalition. The Congress – which had governed India for all but five years from independence until 1996 – ruled from 2004 to 2014 with its allies, under Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.Then, in 2014, Modi and the BJP won a massive mandate to come to power. They improved their numbers in 2019.Yet, other numbers slid in this period. Over the past decade under a majority BJP government, India has fallen on several democratic indices amid accusations of a crackdown on dissent, political opposition and media.

200,India’s mega Kumbh festival gets BJP boost ahead of election,"New Delhi, India – Over 100 million people will be taking a holy dip at the confluence of two rivers in northern India‘s Prayagraj city as the eight-week-long Kumbh festival began on Tuesday.The Kumbh, billed as the world’s biggest gathering of humanity, is a mass pilgrimage in which Hindus gather in specific locations along the holy rivers Ganges, Yamuna and the mythical river Saraswati for a holy dip that they believe will cleanse their sins and bring salvation.The religious event in the Uttar Pradesh state, which will continue till March 4, is being organised by the right-wing governments at both the federal and state levels in an election year.Astrology determines most aspects of the UNESCO-listed festival, including its exact date and length. Where the festival will be held depends on the positions of the planet Jupiter, sun and the Earth.“It is an exhilarating experience. To be part of a sea of humanity that arrives to take a dip in the holy waters, it is humbling and joyful. You abandon your fears at the Kumbh and hopefully your sins,” Gopal Mishra, a devout Hindu who has been to the festival several times, told Al Jazeera.There are six particularly auspicious days to bathe, termed as Shahi Snan, meaning a royal bath. The biggest bathing day is February 4, when approximately 30 million people are expected to take a dip.The first Shahi Snan began before the dawn on Tuesday.“Teams will be managing crowds on the river bank. All roads leading to the Kumbh Mela grounds will be packed with hundreds of thousands of pilgrims in the coming days,” Bimlesh Kumar, a senior official at the government tourism department told Al Jazeera.“We are expecting around 120 million people, and an additional two million foreign visitors this year. The festival will continue for 49 days. An average two million people are likely to take a dip every day,” he added.Prayagraj city had been preparing for the festival for months as the government built communal areas with 20,000 beds and a tented city with 4,200 “premium” tents around the river.According to a report, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led federal and state governments are spending over $620m, more than triple the public money spent in 2013 on the same event.The government says 116 roads have been constructed and 524 shuttle buses deployed to transport the pilgrims. More than 122,000 toilets have been built for the attendees.On Tuesday, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted to say he hoped visitors to this year’s Kumbh would “experience India’s spiritual, cultural and social diversities”.Translated tweet: “Good wishes for the sacred Kumbh Mela starting at Prayagraj. I hope the devotees from India and abroad will get a glimpse of the country’s spiritual, cultural and social diversities. I wish more and more people become part of this divine and grand event.”The relentless promotion of Kumbh by the ruling BJP coincides with the general election due in a few months.The BJP’s electoral losses in five Indian states last month have shown a dip in Modi’s popularity.The ruling party is making renewed appeals to its hardcore Hindu nationalist base in Uttar Pradesh, India’s politically most important state, which is hosting this year’s Kumbh.Ahead of the Kumbh gathering, BJP leader and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath changed the name of the historical city of Allahabad to the more “Hindu” sounding Prayagraj.The BJP has also announced the construction of a giant statue of Hindu deity Ram in the state.In contrast, the state police are cracking down on Muslims praying in open areas like parks.Earlier in 2018, the Indian government had also announced the end of a decades-long policy of giving subsidy to thousands of Muslims heading to the holy city of Mecca to perform the annual Hajj pilgrimage.Uttar Pradesh, India’s most populous state with 200 million people, sends 80 MPs to Parliament’s lower house, the reason it is a politically crucial state.Opposition parties say the government is trying to hide its failures in governance and is promoting itself in the media instead of the Kumbh festival.Images of Modi and Adityanath are splashed on Kumbh promotional billboards across Prayagraj city.“Kumbh is not a substitute for effective governance. The BJP often behaves like a publicity and marketing company. This holy festival has always been organised by the government. But money was never spent such lavishly, solely for advertisements of the government,” Akhilesh Pratap Singh, national spokesperson of the Congress party, told Al Jazeera in Lucknow.“At the moment, people want answers from them. Where are the jobs for our youth, safety for women, rule of law, industry? It’s not possible for them to deflect attention from their governance failures any more,” he added.The Kumbh has been marred several times by stampedes. Over 800 people were killed in 1954, 40 died in Nashik western India in 2003, while 36 people died in the 2013 gathering in Allahabad (now Prayagraj).On Monday, a small fire broke out at one of the camps, although no casualties were reported.Hindu religious belief says that in a fight over an urn between the gods and the demons, a few drops of the essence of immortality spilled on to four places on the Earth, which now host the Kumbh, one of which is Prayagraj.There are three different kinds of Kumbh: an Ardha (or half) Kumbh held every six years at two locations, a Purna (or full) Kumbh every 12 years at four locations and a Maha Kumbh that happens every 144 years or after 12 Purna Kumbhs.Critics of the Modi government say a half Kumbh is being given unprecedented prominence this time and there is a conscious attempt to boost support for events that reinforce Hindu symbols appealing to the BJP’s Hindu nationalist support base.India’s 1.3 billion people are about 80 percent Hindu and appeals to religion or caste are deeply ingrained in Indian politics.A report by the investigative magazine Caravan last month said the BJP’s ideological mentor, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), is attempting to drum up support for the government using the Kumbh ahead of the elections.Hindu supremacist groups such as the RSS and the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) are clamouring for a government order to bypass the Supreme Court in order to build a Ram temple in Ayodhya city of Uttar Pradesh.In 1992, a Hindu mob tore down a medieval mosque, which they claim stood at a contested site believed to be the birthplace of Ram.“Right from the Babri mosque demolition, the right-wing in India always uses religious congregation to promote Hindutva or a militant radical strain of Hinduism backed by the current ruling party. Previous Kumbh festivals from the mid-1980s onwards have been fertile ground for making political demands,” Nilanjan Mukhopadhyay, a political analyst in New Delhi, told Al Jazeera.But the ruling BJP denies any political overtones to the festival.“It is a sacred and auspicious time for Hindus. Kumbh has a special place in not just the religious but cultural life of Indians. Every government, irrespective of ideology, has been organising this festival at a mega scale,” Sudhanshu Mittal, spokesperson of the ruling BJP, told Al Jazeera.On January 31 and February 1, a Dharma Sansad (religious assembly) will be held at the Kumbh by the VHP, one of the many far-right Hindu groups linked to the ruling BJP party.On the opening day of the festival, the Indian media reported slogans of “Modi, you lead the fight, we are with you” and “the temple will be built in Ayodhya” being raised on loudspeakers amid religious Hindu chants.The idea is to use Kumbh as a rallying point, says Akshaya Mukul, the author of “Gita Press and the Making of Hindu India”.“In the times of divided polity and an election year, a Hindu nationalist party like BJP will definitely extract political mileage out of it. Social media is abuzz with videos praising the BJP for its arrangements. Apparently, never before has a state administration worked so hard,” Mukul told Al Jazeera.“It is ironic that in a state where infants die for the lack of oxygen, arrangement of a religious fair is seen as a marker of good administration,” he said, referring to a 2017 tragedy in which more than 60 infants died for lack of oxygen in a state-run hospital in Uttar Pradesh due to unpaid bills.“The BJP will use this year’s Kumbh to the hilt and maximise benefits. It remains to be seen if it succeeds or not since it has failed in fulfilling its basic promises of jobs, education and healthcare,” said Mukul.",Ayodhya Ram Mandir,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/1/15/indias-mega-kumbh-festival-gets-bjp-boost-ahead-of-election,AL JAZEERA,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""framing"", ""reason"": ""The article frames the Kumbh festival as a BJP boost ahead of election, implying that the festival is being politicized by the ruling party.

201,Timeline: India holy site dispute,"Security has been tight in Ayodhya, the town in north India at the centre of the temple-mosque dispute [AFP]Muslims and Hindus of India have been arguing over the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid religious site since the beginning of the 16th century, when a mosque was built on the site which Hindus revere as the birthplace of Lord Ram, a Hindu deity.1853: First recorded incident of violence over the site when a Hindu sect claimed the structure, contending that the mosque stood on the spot where a temple had been destroyed.1855: Both Hindus and Muslims worship in the same building.1857: After rising tension, the British colonial government puts up a wall in front of the mosque. Hindus, forbidden access to the inner yard, begin making their offerings on a platform (chabootra) in the outer yard.1883: Efforts to construct a temple on this platform were halted by the deputy commissioner.1885: A Hindu priest files a suit to seek permission to construct a larger pltaform in the outer courtyard of the disputed site.Dec 1885: The judge dismisses the suit, saying that the temple would be too close to the mosque. The priest appeals against order in court of a local district judge.1886: A second appeal is filed before the judicial commissioner who also dismissed the case. With this, the first round of legal battles fought by the Hindus came to an end.“It is most unfortunate that a Masjid should have been built on land held sacred by Hindus, but as that event occurred 356 years ago, it is too late now to remedy the grievance; all that can be done is to maintain status quo.”District judge Col. Chamier dismisses suit filed on March 18, 18861934: Walls around the mosque and one of the domes are damaged during communal riots.1949: In a midnight operation, Hindu activists quietly erect statues of Rama and Sita in the mosque, while police guards are asleep. Next day riots between Hindus and Muslims break out in and around the site. The government proclaims the premises a disputed area and locks the gates.1970: Archaeological excavations in and around the site indicate a large Hindu complex existed on the site. Muslims strongly criticise the findings, claiming that it failed to mention evidence of a temple in its interim reports.1985: The Rajiv Gandhi government orders the locks on the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid to be removed. Prior to that date, only one Hindu ceremony per year was permitted.1989: Communal tension in the region worsens when the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP), a Hindu group, receives permission to perform a stone-laying ceremony at the disputed site.1992: The mosque is torn down by Hindu activists, prompting nationwide rioting between Hindus and Muslims in which more than 2,000 people die.Dec 1992: The Liberhan commission is set up to investigate the circumstances that led to the demolition of the mosque.2001: Tensions rise on the anniversary of the demolition of the mosque. VHP pledges again to build Hindu temple at the site.2002: Hundreds of volunteers converge on the site after the VHP confirms plans to begin construction of a temple at the disputed site. At least 58 people are killed in an attack on a train in Godhra which is carrying Hindu activists returning from Ayodhya.Mar 2002: Almost 2,000 people, mostly Muslims, die in communal violence in Gujarat following the train attack.2005: An explosives-laden jeep is driven into the wall of the mosque complex. Security forces kill five suspected Muslim fighters in the aftermath of the attack.2009: The Liberhan commission submits its report to Manmohan Singh, India’s prime minister, more than 16 years after the demolition of the mosque. The report blames Hindu politicians, causing an uproar in the Indian parliament.Sept 2010: Allahabad High Court to issue a final ruling on whether the land of the religious site belongs to Muslims or Hindus.",Ayodhya Ram Mandir,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2010/9/30/timeline-india-holy-site-dispute,AL JAZEERA,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""omission"", ""reason"": ""Key events and perspectives from the Muslim side are not mentioned, such as the criticism of archaeological findings in 1970."", ""confidence"": 0.8}",no,none,no omission bias is in scope here
202,"India lands Chandrayaan-3 craft on moon, asserting its place in space tech","India has landed a spacecraft on the moon, as the country – the fourth to achieve a moon landing – cements its growing prowess in space and technology.The Indian spacecraft Chandrayaan-3 landed on Wednesday on the moon’s south pole, an uncharted territory that scientists believe could hold vital reserves of frozen water and precious elements.The mission is seen as crucial to lunar exploration and confirming India’s standing as a space power, and came just days after a similar Russian lander crashed.“India is on the moon,” said S Somanath, chief of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) as the spacecraft landed.A successful moon mission would dovetail with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s image of an ascendant India asserting its place among the global elite and would help bolster his popularity in advance of a crucial general election next year.“This is a victory cry of a new India,” said Modi, who was seen waving the Indian flag as he watched the landing from South Africa, where he is attending the BRICS summit.Scientists and officials clapped, cheered and hugged each other as the spacecraft landed, with the government now looking to spur investment in private space launches and related satellite-based businesses.The latest mission came with a price tag of $74.6m – far lower than those of other countries, and a testament to India’s frugal space engineering.This was India’s second attempt to land a spacecraft on the moon and came less than a week after Russia’s Luna-25 mission failed. People across the country were glued to television screens and said prayers as the spacecraft approached the surface.Chandrayaan means “moon vehicle” in Hindi and Sanskrit. In 2019, ISRO’s Chandrayaan-2 mission successfully deployed an orbiter but its lander crashed.“In general, it’s very difficult to land on the south part of the moon. Most vehicles have landed in the equator region of the moon, where the characteristics of the moon are much easier to deal with,” Christopher Conselice, professor of extragalactic astronomy at the University of Manchester, told Al Jazeera.“It’s a very historic day, and I really look forward to the science we’re going to see come out of the [mission]. I think it will be quite interesting, and I hope it encourages other missions to do similar things around the moon,” he said.The Chandrayaan-3 is expected to remain functional for two weeks, running a series of experiments, including a spectrometer analysis of the mineral composition of the lunar surface.Its landing on the moon was “very important” for India, as it helped demonstrate its “technological advancement”, according to Carla Filotico, a consultant at SpaceTec Partners.“It is important for scientific exploration as it is landing on the [moon’s] south pole and it will allow India to explore the water and ice on the moon,” Filotico said.“[It will help in] accumulating data on science and geology of the moon and gathering information on exploration of the solar system’s history and evolution.”Congratulatory messages poured in from around the world following the successful landing.The US Department of State’s Bureau of Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs said Chandrayaan-3 success will “power” the future.“Your success will power the imagination and light the future of people around the world,” the department posted on X, formerly known as Twitter.Meanwhile, Russian President Vladimir Putin congratulated India for an “impressive” achievement.“This is a big step forward in space exploration and, of course, a testament to the impressive progress made by India in the field of science and technology,” the Kremlin statement read.Numerous countries and private companies have been racing to successfully land a spacecraft on the lunar surface.Japan plans to launch a lunar lander to the moon over the weekend as part of an X-ray telescope mission, and two US companies have also been vying to put landers on the moon by the end of the year, one of them at the south pole.In the coming years, NASA plans to land astronauts at the lunar south pole.",Chandrayaan-3,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/8/23/india-lands-chandrayaan-3-craft-on-moon-asserting-its-place-in-space-tech,AL JAZEERA,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""tonality"", ""reason"": ""The article's tone is overwhelmingly positive and celebratory towards India's achievement, using phrases such as 'victory cry of a new India' and 'asserting its place among the global elite'.

203,How did the world react to India’s ‘historic’ moon landing?,"India has become the first country to land a spacecraft near the moon’s south pole after the Indian Space Research Organisation’s Chandrayaan-3 touched down on Wednesday.The mission is seen as an important step for further lunar exploration and India’s standing as a space power, as the country becomes the fourth nation to successfully land a spacecraft on the moon after the United States, China and Russia.Here are some key reactions from around the world:“This moment is unforgettable. It is phenomenal. It is the call of a developed India. It is the victory call for a new India,” Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said after the successful landing.Indian opposition leader Rahul Gandhi also celebrated Chandrayaan-3’s success, calling it a result of “tremendous ingenuity and hard work” by the country’s scientific community.“Since 1962, India’s space program has continued to scale new heights and inspire generations of young dreamers,” he posted on social media platform X.Historic day for India's space sector.

204,Chandrayaan-3: Historic India mission for moon’s south pole set for landing,"India could become the first nation to land a spacecraft on the moon’s south pole, days after a Russian probe crashed in the same region – an historic moment for the world’s most populous nation, as it rapidly closes in on milestones set by global space powers.Chandrayaan-3, which means “Mooncraft” in Sanskrit, is scheduled to touch down shortly after 6pm India time (12:30 GMT) on Wednesday near the little-explored lunar south pole.“India reaches for the moon”, The Times of India front-page headline read on Wednesday, with the hoped-for lunar landing dominating local news. “It’s D-Day for moon mission”, The Hindustan Times said.A previous Indian effort failed in 2019, and the latest attempt comes just days after Russia’s first moon mission in almost 50 years, destined for the same region, crashed on the lunar surface.But former Indian space chief K Sivan said the latest photos transmitted back home by the lander gave every indication the final leg of the voyage would succeed.“It is giving some encouragement that we will be able to achieve the landing mission without any problem,” he told AFP news agency on Monday.Sivan added that the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) had made corrections after a failure four years ago, when scientists lost contact with the previous lunar module moments before its slated landing.“Chandrayaan-3 is going to go with more ruggedness,” he said. “We have confidence, and we expect that everything will go smoothly.”Anil Kumar Bhatt, director general of the Indian Space Association, told Al Jazeera he was confident the spacecraft will make a soft landing.“India has already had two missions, Chandrayaan-1, which was a total success; Chandrayaan-2, which was partially successful, and of course, our lander at that time crash-landed but the lessons learned from that I am very sure have been picked up very well by our scientists,” he said.“And this time, they have had all the fail-safe mechanisms put into it, they have learnt the right lessons and I am very sure … we will have a very good

205,India’s Chandrayaan-3 space mission enters moon’s orbit,"India’s latest space mission, Chandrayaan-3, has entered the moon’s orbit more than three weeks after its launch, the country’s space agency said on Saturday.The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) confirmed that Chandrayaan-3, which means moon vehicle in Sanskrit, had been “successfully inserted into the lunar orbit”.If the rest of the current mission goes to plan, the mission will safely touch down near the moon’s little-explored south pole between August 23 and 24.India’s last attempt to do so ended in failure four years ago, when ground control lost contact moments before landing.Developed by ISRO, Chandrayaan-3 includes a lander module named Vikram, which means “valour” in Sanskrit, and a rover named Pragyan, the Sanskrit word for wisdom.It is a major milestone for the country that has run its ambitious aerospace programme on a comparatively low budget. Only Russia, the United States and China have previously achieved a controlled landing on the lunar surface.The mission comes with a price tag of $74.6m – far smaller than those of other countries, and a testament to India’s frugal space engineering.Experts say India can keep costs low by copying and adapting existing space technology, and thanks to an abundance of highly skilled engineers who earn a fraction of their foreign counterparts’ wages.The Chandrayaan-3 spacecraft has taken much longer to reach the moon than the manned Apollo missions of the 1960s and 1970s, which arrived in a matter of days.The Indian rocket used is much less powerful than the United States’ Saturn V and instead the probe orbited Earth five or six times elliptically to gain speed, before being sent on a month-long lunar trajectory.If the landing is successful the rover will roll off Vikram and explore the nearby lunar area, gathering images to be sent back to Earth for analysis.The rover has a mission life of one lunar day or 14 Earth days.ISRO chief S Somanath has said his engineers carefully studied data from the last failed mission and tried their best to fix the glitches.India’s space programme has grown considerably in size and momentum since it first sent a probe to orbit the moon in 2008.In 2014, it became the first Asian nation to put a satellite into orbit around Mars, and three years later, the ISRO launched 104 satellites in a single mission.The ISRO’s Gaganyaan (Sanskrit for sky craft) programme is slated to launch a three-day manned mission into Earth’s orbit by next year.India is also working to boost its 2 percent share of the global commercial space market by sending private payloads into orbit for a fraction of the cost of competitors.",Chandrayaan-3,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/8/6/indias-chandrayaan-3-space-mission-enters-moons-orbit,AL JAZEERA,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""labeling"", ""reason"": ""Loaded labels/titles applied asymmetrically: 'India's latest space mission', 'a major milestone for the country' imply a positive tone without parity across actors."", ""confidence"": 0.8}",no,none,no labelling bias
206,India’s Chandrayaan-3 rover confirms sulphur on moon’s south pole,"India’s moon rover has confirmed the presence of sulphur and detected several other elements on the lunar south pole, says the country’s space agency.Last week, India became the first country to land a craft near the largely unexplored south pole, and just the fourth nation to land on the moon.“The Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS) instrument onboard Chandrayaan-3 Rover has made the first-ever in-situ measurements on the elemental composition of the lunar surface near the south pole,” the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) said in a statement dated Monday.“These in-situ measurements confirm the presence of sulphur in the region unambiguously, something that was not feasible by the instruments onboard the orbiters,” it said.The spectrographic analysis also confirmed the presence of aluminium, calcium, iron, chromium and titanium on the lunar surface, ISRO added, with additional measurements showing the presence of manganese, silicon and oxygen.The six-wheeled solar-powered rover Pragyan – wisdom in Sanskrit – will amble around the relatively unmapped south pole and transmit images and scientific data over its two-week lifespan as it searches for signs of frozen water that could help future astronaut missions as a potential source of drinking water or to make rocket fuel.The rover also will study the moon’s atmosphere and seismic activity, ISRO chairman S Somanath said.On Monday, the rover’s route was reprogrammed when it came close to a 4-metre-wide (13-foot-wide) crater. “It’s now safely heading on a new path,” ISRO said.The craft moves at a slow speed of about 10 centimetres (4 inches) per second to minimise shock and damage to the vehicle from the moon’s rough terrain.India has been steadily matching the achievements of other space programmes – active since the 1960s – at a fraction of their cost, despite suffering some setbacks.The Chandrayaan-3 mission cost an estimated $75m – less than the budget of Hollywood space thriller, Gravity.Four years ago, the previous Indian lunar mission failed during its final descent, in what was seen at the time as a huge setback for the programme.Chandrayaan-3 has captivated public attention since launching nearly six weeks ago in front of thousands of cheering spectators, and its successful touchdown on the moon last week came just days after Russia’s Luna-25 lander crashed in the same region.Russia’s head of the state-controlled space corporation Roscosmos attributed the failure to the lack of expertise due to the long break in lunar research that followed the last Soviet mission to the moon in 1976.In 2014, India became the first Asian nation to put a craft into orbit around Mars and plans to send a probe towards the sun in September.ISRO is slated to launch a three-day crewed mission into Earth’s orbit by next year.The agency is also planning its first mission to the International Space Station next year in collaboration with the United States, a joint mission with Japan to send another probe to the moon by 2025, and an orbital mission to Venus within the next two years.",Chandrayaan-3,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/8/30/indias-chandrayaan-3-rover-confirms-sulphur-on-moons-south-pole,AL JAZEERA,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""framing"", ""reason"": ""The article frames India's space program as a success story, highlighting its achievements and cost-effectiveness while downplaying setbacks."", ""confidence"": 0.8}",no,none,no framing bias
207,Chandrayaan-3 rover takes ‘walk on moon’ as India celebrates historic feat,"The moon rover of India’s Chandrayaan-3 has exited the spacecraft to begin its exploration of the lunar surface, the country’s space agency said on messaging platform X, formerly known as Twitter.The spacecraft landed on the unexplored south pole of the moon on Wednesday evening, days after Russia’s Luna-25 failed, making India the first country to achieve that feat.“The Ch-3 Rover ramped down from the Lander and India took a walk on the moon!” the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) said in its message on Thursday morning.The six-wheeled, solar-powered rover, named Pragyan (or wisdom” in Sanskrit) will amble around the relatively unmapped region and transmit images and scientific data over its two-week lifespan.Accomplished with a budget of about 6.15bn Indian rupees ($74.58m), this was India’s second attempt to touch down on the moon. A previous mission in 2019, Chandrayaan-2, successfully deployed an orbiter but its lander crashed.Chandrayaan means “moon vehicle” in Hindi and Sanskrit.The moon’s rugged south pole is coveted because of its water ice, which is believed to be capable of providing fuel, oxygen and drinking water for future missions, but its rough terrain makes landing challenging.People across the country tuned in to watch the landing on Wednesday, with more than seven million people viewing the YouTube livestream alone.Prayers were also held at places of worship, and schools organised live screenings of the spectacle for students.Prime Minister Narendra Modi said Wednesday that the successful lunar landing – previously achieved only by the United States, Russia and China – was a triumph for “all of humanity”.Elon Musk, whose firm SpaceX is a leader in commercial space launches, hailed the landing as “super cool”.India has a comparatively low-budget space programme, but one that has grown considerably in size and momentum since it first sent a probe to orbit the moon in 2008.Chandrayaan-3’s cost was far lower than many missions from other countries and a testament to India’s frugal space engineering.In 2014, India became the first Asian nation to put a craft into orbit around Mars and plans to send a probe towards the sun in September.ISRO is slated to launch a three-day crewed mission into Earth’s orbit by next year.It also plans a joint mission with Japan to send another probe to the Moon by 2025 and an orbital mission to Venus within the next two years.",Chandrayaan-3,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/8/24/chandrayaan-3-rover-takes-walk-on-moon-as-india-celebrates-historic-feat,AL JAZEERA,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""labeling"", ""reason"": ""Loaded label 'historic feat' applied asymmetrically to India's achievement."", ""confidence"": 0.8}",no,none,no labelling bias
208,What is India’s Chandrayaan moon mission and when will it launch?,"India’s space agency is set to launch its homegrown Chandrayaan-3 moon mission from the southeastern island of Sriharikota, at the Satish Dhawan Space Centre on July 14 at 2:35pm local time (09:05 GMT).Built on a budget of just under $75m, Chandrayaan – “moon vehicle” in Sanskrit – will attempt to land a rover on the moon and establish India as a formidable force in space exploration.A 43.5-metre (143-feet) Launch Vehicle Mark-III, or LVM3, launch rocket will blast the spacecraft into an elliptical Earth orbit before it loops towards the moon for a scheduled landing near the moon’s south pole around August 23.If successful, Chandrayaan-3 will make India the fourth nation to successfully land a spacecraft on the moon, joining the Soviet Union, the United States and China.The mission has three main objectives:The six-wheeled Pragyan rover will have two payloads – two spectrometers will attempt to find materials from the ancient lunar crust.In addition, one payload, the Spectro-polarimetry of Habitable Planet Earth (SHAPE), will measure spectral and polarimetric radiation and understand what signatures of habitable Earth-like planets could look like.The mission life for the rover and lander is scheduled to be about one lunar day (roughly 14 Earth days).pic.twitter.com/7V6nHsxE5V— ISRO (@isro) July 5, 2023Since 1958, there have been 70 successful and partially successful missions by six nations to the moon — though many of them have orbited Earth’s only satellite without landing. A further 41 flights were not successful, according to NASA’s archive.During the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, the United States and USSR were the only countries that attempted missions to the moon. Between them, the two Cold War rivals attempted at least 90 moon missions, 40 of which were unsuccessful.During the 1980s, no lunar missions were launched.In 1990, Japan joined the space race with its Hiten Orbiter. In the 2000s, China, India and the European Space Agency launched their first successful orbital missions to the moon.In 2019, India’s Chandrayaan-2 mission successfully deployed an orbiter but lost contact with its lander and crash-landed near where Chandrayaan-3 will attempt a touchdown.The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), will be live streaming the event on its YouTube page.

209,Chandrayaan-3: India launches rocket to land spacecraft on moon,"India’s space agency has launched a rocket that will attempt to land a spacecraft at the lunar south pole, an unprecedented feat that would advance India’s position as a major space power.Television footage on Friday showed the Indian Space Research Organisation’s (ISRO) LVM3 launch rocket blast off from the country’s main spaceport at Sriharikota in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh, leaving behind a plume of smoke and fire.The Chandrayaan-3 mission – “moon vehicle” in Sanskrit – is designed to deploy a lander and rover near the moon’s south pole on about August 23.Applause and cheers swept through mission control at Satish Dhawan Space Centre, where the ISRO engineers and scientists celebrated as they monitored the launch of the spacecraft.Thousands of Indians cheered outside the mission control centre and waved the national flag as they watched the craft rise into the sky.“Congratulations India. Chandrayaan-3 has started its journey towards the moon,” ISRO Director Sreedhara Panicker Somanath said shortly after the launch.Only three other space agencies – the United States, the former Soviet Union and China – have touched down a lander on the moon’s surface.None has landed near the lunar south pole.Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is currently visiting France, tweeted that the mission was carrying the “hopes and dreams of our nation”.The third Chandrayaan includes a two-metre-tall lander designed to deploy a rover near the lunar south pole, where it is expected to remain functional for two weeks running a series of experiments.ISRO’s Chandrayaan-2 mission in 2020 successfully deployed an orbiter but its lander and rover were destroyed in a crash near where the Chandrayan-3 will attempt a touchdown.Upon touchdown, the rover will roll off the lander, named Vikram, which means valour in Sanskrit and explore the nearby area, gathering images to be sent back to Earth for analysis.The rover, named Pragyan, the Sanskrit word for wisdom, has a mission life of one lunar day or 14 Earth days.",Chandrayaan-3,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/7/14/chandrayaan-3-india-launches-rocket-to-land-spacecraft-on-moon,AL JAZEERA,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""labeling"", ""reason"": ""Loaded label 'major space power' applied to India without parity across other countries."", ""confidence"": 0.8}",yes,labelling,label 'major space power' applied to India without parity across other countries
210,Will India’s new moon mission propel it into an elite orbit?,"India’s space agency is readying to launch a rocket as soon as Friday that will attempt to land a rover on the moon and mark the country’s arrival as a power in space exploration and the new frontier of space commerce.Built on a budget of less than $75m, the Chandrayaan-3, which means “moon vehicle” in Sanskrit, is set to blast off from India’s main spaceport in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh at 2:35pm local time (09:05 GMT).If the mission succeeds, India will join a small group of nations comprising the United States, the former Soviet Union and China that have made soft landings on the moon.An attempt by a Japanese start-up earlier this year ended with the lander crashing due to an altitude miscalculation that meant the spacecraft ran out of fuel.An Israeli spacecraft, built by SpaceIL and Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI), also crashed into the moon’s surface earlier this year.India’s space industry will be looking for redemption with this mission after the Chandrayaan-2 mission in 2020 successfully deployed an orbiter, but its lander and rover were destroyed in a crash.The Chandrayaan-2 mission was designed to study permanently shadowed moon craters that are thought to contain water deposits confirmed by an earlier Chandrayaan-1 mission in 2008 — which orbited the moon but didn’t land.If everything goes to plan, the 43.5-metre (143-foot) Launch Vehicle Mark-III, or LVM3, rocket will blast the spacecraft into an elliptical Earth orbit before it loops towards the moon for a scheduled landing around August 23 near where the Chandrayaan-2 crashed.The LVM-3 is a three-stage rocket with two solid-fuel boosters and a liquid-fuel core stage. The solid-fuel boosters provide the initial thrust before the liquid-fuel core stage ensures sustained thrust to propel the rocket into orbit.The Chandrayaan-3 includes a 2-metre (6.5-foot) tall lander designed to deploy a rover near the lunar south pole where water ice has been detected.The rover is expected to remain functional for two weeks running a series of experiments.The launch by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) is the country’s first major mission since Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government announced policies to spur investment in private space launches and related satellite-based businesses.Since 2020, when India opened to private launches, the number of space start-ups has more than doubled.India, in recent years, has cemented itself as a leading supplier of commercial space operations, including the launch of its first privately developed rocket, Vikram-S, in November 2022 as part of a mission named Prarambh, meaning the beginning.The mission developed by Skyroot Aerospace included investors such as Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund GIC.India wants its space companies to increase their share of the global launch market by fivefold within the next decade, officials have said, up from 2 percent by revenue in 2020.India is experienced in launching smaller satellites and has been trying to corner this market, pitching itself as a satellite launch facility.In October, the ISRO announced that its rocket had successfully put 36 internet satellites into orbit for the UK-based satellite company OneWeb.In July, India became the 27th country to sign the Artemis Accords with the US.The ambitious Artemis programme aims to, among other things, land the first astronauts on Mars and eventually on other planets.NASA and ISRO have also agreed to launch a joint mission to the International Space Station (ISS) in 2024.On a visit to the US last month, Modi and US President Joe Biden pledged to deepen collaboration in space.Voyager Space, a Denver-based company with a NASA contract to develop the planned Starlab space station, said this week it had signed a memorandum of understanding with ISRO to use Indian rockets and would look for opportunities to collaborate with Indian space start-ups.“India sees space as a strategic asset, and it aims to become one of the leading players in outer space,” said Carla Filotico, managing director at consultancy SpaceTec Partners. “This could be India’s opportunity to be one of the pioneers in this industry.”The ISRO plans to launch its second interplanetary mission next year, the Mangalyaan-2, which will observe and study the surface of Mars.Mangal means Mars in Sanskrit, while yaan means craft or vehicle.The first Mangalyaan mission entered Mars orbit in 2014 and operated for seven and a half years.The mission cost only $74m and made headlines for costing less than the Academy Award-winning film Gravity.A third Mangalyaan mission is also planned, which will include a soft landing on Mars in 2030.",Chandrayaan-3,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/7/13/will-indias-new-moon-mission-propel-it-into-an-elite-orbit,AL JAZEERA,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""framing"", ""reason"": ""The article frames India's space program as a success story, highlighting its potential to join an 'elite orbit' and become a leading player in outer space.

211,India launches rocket to observe sun days after historic moon landing,"India has launched a rocket to study the sun, a little over a week after its successful unmanned landing on the moon.The Aditya-L1 rocket, carrying scientific instruments to observe the sun’s outermost layers, blasted off at 11:50am (06:20 GMT) on Saturday for its four-month journey.The rocket left a trail of smoke and fire as scientists clapped, a live broadcast on the Indian Space Research Organisation’s (ISRO) website showed.#WATCH | Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) launches India's first solar mission, #AdityaL1 from Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota, Andhra Pradesh.Aditya L1 is carrying seven different payloads to have a detailed study of the Sun. pic.twitter.com/Eo5bzQi5SO— ANI (@ANI) September 2, 2023The broadcast was watched by nearly 500,000 viewers, while thousands gathered at a viewing gallery near the launch site to see the lift-off of the probe, which will aim to study solar winds, which can cause disturbance on earth commonly seen as auroras.According to ISRO, the spacecraft is carrying “seven scientific payloads for systematic study of the sun”, all of which were indigenously developed in collaborations between India’s space agency and scientific institutes.The United States and the European Space Agency (ESA) have sent numerous probes to the centre of the solar system, beginning with NASA’s Pioneer programme in the 1960s. But if the latest mission by the ISRO is successful, it will be the first probe by any Asian nation to be placed in solar orbit.Named after the Hindi word for the sun, the Aditya-L1 launch follows India beating Russia late last month to become the first country to land on the south pole of the moon. While Russia had a more powerful rocket, India’s Chandrayaan-3 out-endured the Luna-25 to execute a textbook landing.The Aditya-L1 is travelling on the ISRO-designed, 320-tonne PSLV XL rocket that has been a mainstay of the Indian space programme, powering earlier launches to the moon and Mars.The spacecraft is designed to travel about 1.5 million km (930,000 miles) over four months to a kind of parking lot in space where objects tend to stay put because of balancing gravitational forces, reducing fuel consumption for the spacecraft.Those positions are called Lagrange Points, named after Italian-French mathematician Joseph-Louis Lagrange.The mission has the capacity to make a “big bang in terms of science,” said Somak Raychaudhury, who was involved in the development of some components of the observatory, adding that energy particles emitted by the sun can hit satellites that control communications on earth.“There have been episodes when major communications have gone down because a satellite has been hit by a big corona emission. Satellites in low earth orbit are the main focus of global private players, which makes the Aditya L1 mission a very important project,” he said.After the success of Chandrayaan-3, India continues its space journey.Congratulations to our scientists and engineers at @isro for the successful launch of India’s first Solar Mission, Aditya -L1.Our tireless scientific efforts will continue in order to develop better…— Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) September 2, 2023India has been steadily matching the achievements of established spacefaring powers at a fraction of their cost.India’s successful landing on the surface of the moon – a feat previously achieved only by Russia, the US and China – was achieved at a cost of less than $75m.India became the first Asian nation to put a craft into orbit around Mars in 2014 and is slated to launch a three-day crewed mission into the Earth’s orbit by next year.",Chandrayaan-3,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/2/after-moon-landing-india-sends-new-space-mission-to-observe-sun,AL JAZEERA,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""framing"", ""reason"": ""The article frames India's space program as a success story, highlighting its achievements at a 'fraction of the cost' compared to established powers.

212,India’s health workers baulk at taking homegrown COVID vaccine,"India is struggling to convince its healthcare and front-line workers to take a homegrown COVID-19 vaccine controversially approved without late-stage efficacy data, government data showed on Thursday, days ahead of a wider roll-out.The country has the world’s second-highest number of COVID-19 infections after the United States, with cases recently surging as mask-wearing declines and states have eased social distancing measures.A lack of confidence in a homegrown vaccine could prevent India from meeting its target of vaccinating 300 million of its 1.35 billion people by August.India has vaccinated more than 10.5 million healthcare and front-line workers since beginning its immunisation campaign on January 16.But only 1.2 million, or about 11 percent, of them, have taken COVAXIN, the locally developed vaccine from Bharat Biotech, while the remaining 9.4 million have used the vaccine licensed from AstraZeneca, according to the government’s Co-Win online platform used to track the vaccination drive.India’s federal government has so far ordered 10 million doses of COVAXIN and 21 million doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca shot. The government says it has received at least 5.5 million COVAXIN doses.“It’s all because of the initial discussion about how [COVAXIN] was only an experimental vaccine, how it had not completed the Phase-3 trial,” said Dr Subhash Salunkhe, who advises the Maharashtra state government on vaccine strategy.“These things created doubts in the minds of people, resulting in lesser acceptance. The availability is not a concern at this juncture.”However, India’s health secretary Rajesh Bhushan on Tuesday attributed the lower uptake of COVAXIN to Bharat Biotech’s limited production capacity compared with that of the Serum Institute of India, the world’s biggest vaccine producer, which is making the AstraZeneca shot for low- and medium-income countries.“We have found that in proportion to the quantity of vaccine available with us, [COVAXIN’s] off-take is fairly satisfactory,” told a news conference.The health ministry did not respond to a request for comment on the latest figures showing that only about 12 percent of the ordered doses had been administered.Earlier this month, Chhattisgarh, an opposition-governed state of 32 million people, told the federal government it would not use COVAXIN until its efficacy could be proven in an ongoing late-stage trial.Epidemiologist and public health experts have also criticised the COVAXIN approval as rushed.Bharat Biotech has said efficacy data from the trial on nearly 26,000 volunteers will be out soon. The company, along with India’s drug regulator, says the vaccine is safe and effective based on early and intermediate studies.Bharat Biotech did not immediately comment on the lower uptake of its vaccine.The government is trying to expedite vaccinations as cases have surged, especially in Maharashtra in the west and the southern state of Kerala, possibly as they have reopened suburban trains and schools.Mask-wearing and social distancing have also largely vanished, with big events like international cricket matches being played in front of tens of thousands of spectators hardly following any COVID-19 rules.India reported 16,738 new coronavirus infections in the past 24 hours, the highest daily jump in a month, health ministry data showed on Thursday, raising the total to 11.05 million.More than half of the new cases were in Maharashtra, India’s richest and home to its financial capital Mumbai, which reported a record high of 8,807 cases on Wednesday.Deaths across the country rose by 138, also the highest in a month, taking the total to 156,705.",Covaxin,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/2/25/indias-health-workers-balk-at-taking-homegrown-covid-vaccine,AL JAZEERA,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""tonality"", ""reason"": ""The article's tone is critical of the Indian government and the COVAXIN vaccine, using words like 'controversially approved', 'lacked confidence', and 'rushed' to describe the approval process.

The vaccine has already been cleared for use in 17 countries.Known by the code BBV152, Covaxin is an inactivated virus-based COVID-19 vaccine developed by Bharat Biotech in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research and the National Institute of Virology.The WHO has described it as “extremely suitable for low- and middle-income countries due to easy storage requirements”.Some of the other approved vaccines must be stored at very low temperatures, which throws up logistical and cost problems.Covaxin “was highly efficacious against laboratory-confirmed symptomatic COVID-19 disease in adults”, the Lancet study said.The jab was also “well tolerated with no safety concerns raised in this interim analysis”, it added.The Indian-developed vaccine has a 78 percent efficacy rate after two doses over a month, according to the WHO.It has joined the COVID vaccines produced by Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna, AstraZeneca, Johnson&Johnson, Sinopharm and Sinovac on the WHO-approved list.The rollout of Covaxin can “increase the finite global manufacturing capacity, and improve insufficient supply of vaccines, which disproportionately affects low-income and middle-income countries,” said Chinese researchers Li Jingxin Li and Zhu Fengcai, who did not take part in the study.They did however mention certain limits to the study, saying that as the trials had been conducted solely in India, there was a less ethnically diverse study group.The studies were also carried out between November 2020 and January 2021, before the more contagious Delta variant of the virus became widespread.Despite the trial dates, the researchers involved were able to identify which of the patients were infected with the Delta variant.

Vaccinations are scheduled to begin on Saturday.First to get the vaccine will be 30 million health and other front-line workers, followed by about 270 million people aged more than 50 or deemed high-risk.Airlines were due to deliver 5.65 million vaccine doses on Tuesday to various cities, aviation minister Hardeep Singh Puri said on Twitter, calling the shipping of vaccines a “momentous mission”.In Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s home state of Gujarat, officials said vaccine distribution was their top priority.“These vaccines will be taken to the cold storage from the airport and swiftly delivered to vaccination booths,” said Nitin Patel, Gujarat’s deputy chief minister.Modi’s government on Monday signed purchase agreements with Pune-based vaccine manufacturer, Serum Institute of India, to buy its Covishield shot – more than a week after approving the vaccine developed by Britain’s AstraZeneca and Oxford University.Serum is supplying some 11 million doses of the shot to the government at 200 rupees ($2.72) a dose, a source said.India’s drug regulator has also approved for emergency use a homegrown vaccine, Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin.But medical groups and others have raised concern about the drug being approved with scant evidence of its effectiveness.It still unclear when and where Covaxin will be distributed.Health authorities in eastern and western states said they would use the experience from regular child immunisation programmes for polio to ensure everyone gets covered in what they called the world’s biggest vaccination drive.But shoddy transport networks and a crumbling healthcare system add an enormous layer of complexity, they said.At close to 10.5 million, India has the second-highest number of COVID-19 infections globally behind the United States, although the rate of increase in cases has been slowing.On Tuesday, the number of infections in India climbed by 12,584, the lowest daily increase in several months.

215,India’s approval of own COVID vaccine criticised for lack of data,"India on Sunday granted emergency approval to Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin but faced questions after taking the step without publishing efficacy data for the homegrown coronavirus vaccine.The news, announced by the drugs controller general of India (DCGI) who did not take questions, was hailed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his ministers as a success in India’s self-reliance push.The government also approved the use of a vaccine developed by AstraZeneca and Oxford University which will be the lead vaccine in India’s immunisation programme until other shots are approved.Covaxin was jointly developed with a government institute and means India joins a small list of countries to have approved its own coronavirus shot.Bharat has partnered with drug developer Ocugen Inc to co-develop it for the US market, and Brazil has signed non-binding letters of intent to buy the shot.The company has said it is in discussions with more than 10 countries about Covaxin.“While this vaccine addresses an unmet medical need during this pandemic, our goal is to provide global access to populations that need it the most,” Bharat Biotech Chairman Krishna Ella said in a statement.“Covaxin has generated excellent safety data with robust immune responses to multiple viral proteins that persist.”Neither the company nor India’s Central Drugs Standards Control Organisation would reveal its efficacy results.A source with knowledge of the matter told Reuters news agency its effectiveness could be more than 60 percent with two doses.China also did not publish detailed efficacy data for a vaccine it authorised on Thursday but its developer has shared interim data.“On what basis was this approval given when Bharat Biotech has NOT shown enough data proving safety & efficacy?” transparency activist Saket Gokhale asked on Twitter.Gokhale has filed a request under India’s right-to-information law, asking the government for safety and other data for the two vaccines approved on Sunday.Covaxin has been fast-tracked like no other vaccine in India. The company said in November it was likely to be launched in the second quarter of 2021, while a government scientist had suggested it might be February or March.Opposition politicians and former ministers on Sunday questioned the lack of transparency in approving it.“Approval was premature and could be dangerous,” said former minister Shashi Tharoor, asking Health Minister Harsh Vardhan for an explanation.“Its use should be avoided till full trials are over. India can start with the AstraZeneca vaccine in the meantime.”Vardhan urged Indians to trust that “stringent protocols” had been followed to ensure the safety and efficacy of the two approved vaccines.In the largest such trial in India, Bharat Biotech said it had recruited 23,000 volunteers out of a target of 26,000 for an ongoing Phase III trial of Covaxin which began in November.",Covaxin,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/1/3/indias-approval-of-own-covid-vaccine-criticised-for-lack-of-data,AL JAZEERA,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""omission"", ""reason"": ""Lack of data on efficacy results from India's Central Drugs Standards Control Organisation and Bharat Biotech, while China's developer shared interim data."", ""confidence"": 0.8}",yes,omission,"Lack of data on efficacy results from India's Central Drugs Standards Control Organisation and Bharat Biotech, while China's developer shared interim data."
216,India-made COVID-19 vaccine likely by February: Gov’t scientist,"An Indian government-backed COVID-19 vaccine could be launched as early as February – months earlier than expected – as last-stage trials begin this month and studies have so far shown it is safe and effective, a senior government scientist has told the Reuters news agency.Bharat Biotech, a private company that is developing COVAXIN alongside the government-run Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), had earlier hoped to launch it only in the second quarter of next year.“The vaccine has shown good efficacy,” senior ICMR scientist Rajni Kant, who is also a member of its COVID-19 task force, said at the research body’s New Delhi headquarters on Thursday.“It is expected that by the beginning of next year, February or March, something would be available.”Bharat Biotech could not immediately be reached for comment, Reuters said.A launch in February would make COVAXIN the first India-made vaccine to be rolled out.India’s number of coronavirus infections rose by 50,201 on Thursday, increasing the total number of infections nationwide to 8.36 million – the second-highest number worldwide after the United States. Deaths rose by 704, with the total now at 124,315.The daily rise in infections and deaths has slowed since a peak in mid-September.Kant, who is the head of ICMR’s research management, policy, planning and coordination cell, said it was up to the health ministry to decide if COVAXIN shots can be given to people even before the third-stage trials are over.“It has shown safety and efficacy in the phase 1 and 2 trials and in the animal studies – so it is safe but you can’t be 100% sure unless the phase 3 trials are over,” Kant said.“There may be some risk, if you are ready to take the risk, you can take the vaccine. If necessary, the government can think of giving the vaccine in an emergency situation.”Indian Health Minister Harsh Vardhan said in September the government was considering granting an emergency authorisation for a COVID-19 vaccine, particularly for the elderly and people in high-risk workplaces.Several leading vaccine candidates are already in final-stage testing. An experimental vaccine developed by the United Kingdom’s AstraZeneca is among the most advanced ones, and the UK expects to roll it out in late December or early 2021.AstraZeneca has signed several supply and manufacturing deals with companies and governments around the world, including with the Serum Institute of India.Other vaccines undergoing tests are being developed by Moderna Inc, Pfizer Inc with partner BioNTech SE, and Johnson & Johnson.",Covaxin,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/11/5/india-made-covid-19-vaccine-likely-by-february-govt-scientist,AL JAZEERA,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""source"", ""reason"": ""The article relies on a government scientist's statement without providing counter-sources from independent experts or critics."", ""confidence"": 0.8}",no,none,no source bias
217,India’s Bharat Biotech: COVID vaccine shows 81 per cent efficacy,"India’s COVID-19 vaccine produced by Bharat Biotech has shown an interim vaccine efficacy of 81 percent in late-stage clinical trials, the company based in the southern city of Hyderabad said.The interim analysis was based on 43 recorded cases of COVID-19 in the trial of 25,800 participants, conducted in partnership with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) – India’s premier medical research body.Thirty-six of the 43 cases were recorded in participants who received a placebo, compared with seven cases in people who were given the Bharat Biotech vaccine, pointing to an efficacy rate of 80.6 per cent, the company said on Wednesday.India had approved the vaccine, branded COVAXIN, in January without late-stage efficacy data, raising questions about its effectiveness.But the move was hailed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi as a success in India’s push towards self-reliance.The vaccination drive in the world’s second-most populous nation, currently under way, includes COVAXIN and a vaccine developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca, named Covishield.India is the country second-worst hit by COVID-19 with more than 11 million cases. Nearly 160,000 people have died due to the disease.Serum Institute of India (SII), the world’s largest vaccine manufacturer, has been producing the Covishield vaccine in partnership with Oxford University and the British company.Earlier this week, Indian Prime Minister Modi was inoculated with the first dose of COVAXIN. Many of his ministers followed suit, opting for the Indian vaccine.India has vaccinated more than 10.5 million healthcare and front-line workers since beginning its immunisation campaign on January 16.But only 1.2 million, or about 11 percent, of them, have taken the locally developed COVAXIN, while the remaining 9.4 million have used the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, according to the government’s Co-Win online platform used to track the vaccination drive.",Covaxin,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/3/3/indias-bharat-biotech-covid-vaccine-shows-81-per-cent-efficacy,AL JAZEERA,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""source"", ""reason"": ""The article relies on Bharat Biotech's statement for efficacy data and quotes Prime Minister Modi positively, but does not provide counter-sources or critical perspectives."", ""confidence"": 0.8}",no,none,no source bias
218,India’s homegrown COVID vaccine company warns some to avoid shot,"India’s homegrown coronavirus vaccine developer Bharat Biotech has warned people with weak immunity and other medical conditions including allergies, fever or a bleeding disorder to consult a doctor before getting the shot – and if possible avoid the vaccine.The company on Tuesday said those receiving its Covaxin shots should disclose their medical condition, medicines they are taking and any history of allergies.It said severe allergic reactions among vaccine recipients may include difficulty breathing, swelling of the face and throat, rapid heartbeat, body rashes, dizziness and weakness.The directive by the Indian manufacturer came three days after India started what the government calls the “world’s largest vaccination programme”.However, the vaccine developed by Bharat Biotech ran into controversy after the country’s drug regulator allowed its use without concrete data showing its effectiveness in preventing COVID-19.The regulator on January 4 approved the emergency use of two vaccines, one developed by Oxford University and United Kingdom-based drugmaker AstraZeneca, and the other by Bharat Biotech.The drug regulator took the step without publishing information about the Indian vaccine’s efficacy.Bharat Biotech has still not published data on its vaccine’s effectiveness but said it is complying with clinical trial guidelines.The regulator maintains the vaccine is safe and gave its approval in the belief that it could be more effective in tackling a new variant of the coronavirus found in the UK.The regulator and the company have said efficacy data will be published after continuing late clinical trials conclude.Most hospitals in India are inoculating healthcare workers with the AstraZeneca vaccine. But turnout, particularly in those hospitals using the Bharat Biotech vaccine, has been relatively low, health officials said.Yesterday only 8 people took COVAXIN at AIIMS though the target was 100.

Indian authorities hope to give vaccines to 300 million people by July 2021.The recipients are to include 30 million doctors, nurses and other front-line workers, to be followed by 270 million people who either are above 50 or have illnesses that make them vulnerable to COVID-19.The vaccination drive began at a time when coronavirus infections have fallen sharply, and much of life has returned to normal.India is second only to the United States in the number of confirmed cases at 10.5 million.

219,Indians await WHO nod for homegrown Covaxin shot to travel abroad,"Stuck in a village in southern India for nine months and unable to return to his job in Saudi Arabia, Sugathan PR is hoping the World Health Organization (WHO) will approve the Indian COVID-19 shot Covaxin, paving the way for his trip back.Like Sugathan, millions of Indians have taken Covaxin and many have complained of travel struggles as the vaccine has not been recognised for international travel by several countries.“I cannot continue to remain idle here any further,” said 57-year-old Sugathan, who returned to Pandalam village in Kerala in January to be with his family after missing his father’s funeral last year when the pandemic disrupted flights.“I had the option of going to Saudi and taking (additional doses of) Covishield after a four-day institutional quarantine, but I was not sure of its implications on my health,” said Sugathan, referring to AstraZeneca’s vaccine.“If the Covaxin approval does not come, I will take the risk of going and taking a Saudi-approved vaccine,” he added, sitting in his spacious two-storey house fronted by paddy fields.The WHO is expected to take a final call on an emergency-use listing for Covaxin on Tuesday.It has deliberated on data supplied by manufacturer Bharat Biotech since early July but has said it could not “cut corners” in making a decision.Without a WHO nod, the two-dose Covaxin is unlikely to be accepted as a valid vaccine globally and would complicate travel plans for Indians who have taken it.Rajan Pallivadakethil Unnunni, 59, who worked in Kuwait as a welder for two decades before flying to India late last year, has been unable to go back as Kuwait does not recognise Covaxin.He is now struggling to repay his $20,000 bank loan selling chicken at a small stall in Kerala and making $4 a day.“If I cannot go back to Kuwait, I will not be able to repay the loan and complete the education of my children,” said Rajan, seated on a plastic stool in front of his shop.“I can buy a ticket to Kuwait only if the Kuwait government app shows a green signal.”",Covaxin,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/10/26/indian-who-covid-homegrown-covaxin-vaccine-travel-abroad,AL JAZEERA,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""tonality"", ""reason"": ""The article's tone is sympathetic towards individuals struggling due to Covaxin not being recognized internationally, using emotive language such as 'stuck', 'struggling', and 'complicated travel plans'.

Gratitude to our doctors, nurses and all those who worked to achieve this feat. #VaccineCentury— Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) October 21, 2021The government was reportedly set to celebrate the milestone with Prime Minister Narendra Modi thanking health workers, special announcements at railway stations and airports, and monuments lit up in the national colours.The government wants all of India’s 944 million adults to get vaccinated this year. As of now, 75 percent of them have got at least one dose, and 31 percent have had two.However, hundreds of millions of Indians under 18 – who make up some 40 percent of the population – have not had a single shot.India has so far reported 34.1 million COVID-19 cases and more than 452,000 deaths, most during a second wave of infections of the Delta variant that surged through the country between April and May.A “sizeable number of people in India have not taken their second dose by the due date despite adequate supplies,” the health ministry said on Tuesday, as new infections fell to their lowest since early March.Daily shots have averaged 5 million this month, a fifth of September’s peak, though states are sitting on record stocks of more than 100 million vaccines as domestic output of the AstraZeneca vaccine soars.Despite the current low number of infections, ministry officials have been urging people to get vaccinated fast, especially as the ongoing festival season means family gatherings and mass shopping, raising the risk of a new wave of infections.India suffered a huge spike in cases in April and May, reporting more than 400,000 infections and 4,000 deaths per day, with many hospitals unable to cope and crematoriums overwhelmed.Cases have since fallen sharply, with fewer than 20,000 infections per day, and most activity has returned to normal.Mumbai, one of India’s myriad teeming cities, recently reported zero deaths in a day for the first time since the pandemic began.Most restrictions on activity have been lifted, with crowds celebrating India’s main religious festival season – an important time for the battered economy – for the first time in two years.This has sparked concerns about a new wave of infections and a renewed push by the government to push people to get their second shots.Media reports last week said an expert panel of India’s drug regulator recommended the use of the homegrown Covaxin – one of seven COVID-19 vaccines approved in India – for under-18s.“I think it is unlikely that we will see a third wave that in any way resembles the second wave,” said Dr Gangandeep Kang, from the Christian Medical College, Vellore.“The only situation where that can happen is if we have a completely new virus variant.

221,"India’s COVID vaccine supply jumps, raising export hopes","India’s rising output of COVID-19 vaccines and the inoculation of more than half its adult population with at least one dose are raising hopes the country will resume being an exporter within months, ramping up from early next year.After donating or selling 66 million doses to nearly 100 countries, India barred exports in mid-April to focus on domestic immunisation as infections exploded, upsetting the inoculation plans of many African and South Asian countries.India’s daily vaccinations surpassed 10 million doses on Friday, with national vaccine production more than doubling since April and set to rise again in the coming weeks.New production lines have been set up, a vaccine developed by Cadila Healthcare won recent approval, and commercial production of Russia’s Sputnik V is starting in India.The Serum Institute of India (SII), the world’s biggest vaccine maker, is now producing about 150 million doses a month of its version of the AstraZeneca shot, more than twice its April output of about 65 million, a source with knowledge of the matter said.“No fixed timeline on exports, but the company hopes to restart in a few months,” said the source, who declined to be named without approval to talk on the matter.The SII, which has previously indicated exports could resume by year-end, did not respond to a request for comment.Global vaccine sharing platform COVAX hopes India will restart foreign sales sooner than later.“With successful national vaccination and the arrival of more products, we are hoping that Indian supply to COVAX will resume as quickly as possible,” a spokesperson for the platform’s co-lead GAVI told Reuters news agency in an email.India, a major international producer of many other vaccines, could play a “similarly transformative role in the global response to COVID-19”, the spokesperson said.India’s health ministry and the foreign ministry, which coordinates vaccine exports, did not respond to a request for comment.Bharat Biotech, the maker of India’s first domestically developed COVID-19 shot, on Sunday inaugurated a new factory with a production capacity of 10 million doses a month.The company said it was “marching towards” a goal of a total annual capacity of about 1 billion doses of the drug, Covaxin.Infections, meanwhile, are again rising in India after an explosive outbreak in April and May. But the country has administered more than 633 million vaccine doses, with 52 percent of its 944 million adults having taken at least one dose and more than 15 percent taking two doses.A government source told Reuters in June the US experience showed that vaccination tends to slow down after a big enough majority of people get their shots. That might give SII a chance to export excess output, said the source.JP Nadda, chief of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s party, said this month India could produce as many as 1.1 billion vaccine doses between September and December, enough to fully immunise all adults in the country this year.India has so far given emergency authorisation to six COVID-19 shots, four of which are being produced locally.One more domestic vaccine is expected to be approved soon while many more are going through mid-stage trials.",Covaxin,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/8/30/india-covid-vaccine-supply-export,AL JAZEERA,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""source"", ""reason"": ""The article relies heavily on sources that support the optimistic view of India's vaccine supply and export prospects, such as COVAX and government officials.

222,India’s Cipla gets nod to distribute Moderna’s COVID vaccine,"Indian drugmaker Cipla Ltd has received regulatory approval to distribute partner Moderna Inc’s COVID-19 vaccine in the country, a senior government official said, clearing the way for India’s first mRNA shot to be imported.Moderna’s vaccine will be the fourth shot authorised for use in India, after AstraZeneca and partner Serum Institute of India’s Covishield, Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin and Sputnik V developed by Russia’s Gamaleya Institute.“Our vaccine basket is now richer by this addition,” government official Vinod Kumar Paul said at a news briefing on Tuesday, adding the government remained in talks with Pfizer over the drugmaker’s vaccine.After a fall in coronavirus cases from a devastating second wave last month, India has doubled down its efforts to vaccinate its 940 million adults amid fears of a third wave of infections.The country has administered 61 million doses in the last two weeks starting from June 12, more than the number of people who signed up for shots during the period, indicating an improvement in supplies after widespread shortages.The government officials did not provide any further details on the partnership between Moderna and Cipla and how the vaccine, which is based on messenger RNA technology, will be imported.“I want to thank the government of India for this authorisation, which marks an important step forward in the global fight against the pandemic,” Moderna’s Chief Executive Officer Stéphane Bancel said.Cipla is supporting Moderna with the regulatory approval and the import of vaccines to be donated to India, the company said in an email, adding that “at this stage, there is no definitive agreement on commercial supplies”.India had in May scrapped local trials for “well-established” foreign coronavirus vaccines to accelerate its vaccination rollout and the officials confirmed that the vaccine developed by Moderna will not require so-called bridging trials.Earlier in the day, Johnson & Johnson said it was in talks with the Indian government to explore ways to speed up the delivery of its single-shot COVID-19 vaccine.Anant Bhan, a senior researcher in health and bioethics, said the Moderna vaccine – which needs to be stored at minus 20 degrees Celsius (minus four Fahrenheit) – was unlikely to be for mass use due to its cold-chain requirements and higher price tag.Rival jabs such as the Covishield vaccine – which is the main shot used in India – can be kept at normal refrigerator temperatures of between two and eight degrees Celsius (36-46 Fahrenheit).“It’s primarily going to be used in the private health sector largely present in the cities. There, they can manage and build to meet some of its storage requirements,” Bhan told AFP news agency.“It is a welcome decision but the question is also what it means in terms of access, number of doses and price point. We will have to wait and watch for that.”So far, India has administered 331.1 million doses, more than the overall shots administered in the United States. The country’s vaccination rate proportionate to the number of the population, however, is much lower than for many other countries.Moderna’s two-dose vaccine has been widely used in several regions, including the US and Europe, but may face some cost and distribution hurdles in India as the shot requires cold storage.“Moderna is coming in ready-to-inject form as there is no manufacturing base” in India, Paul said. “But we also hope, going into the future, Moderna should produce this vaccine on Indian soil.”",Covaxin,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/6/30/india-cipla-moderna-covid-vaccine,AL JAZEERA,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""tonality"", ""reason"": ""The article presents a neutral tone towards the government's decision to approve Moderna's vaccine, but uses a slightly positive tone when quoting government officials and Moderna's CEO.

223,COVID-19: How will India vaccinate nearly one billion people?,"New Delhi, India – India prepares to embark on its biggest ever immunisation drive after the drug regulator approved the emergency use of two coronavirus vaccines.The Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) on Sunday gave the green light to two vaccines, one developed by British-Swedish pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca with Oxford University, and another by local pharmaceutical firm Bharat Biotech.The Bharat Biotech’s vaccine, called Covaxin, was granted a conditional nod despite a lack of a critical phase-three trial, raising concerns about its efficacy.Covaxin is being developed indigenously in collaboration with the government research body, Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), as part of the government’s push for “atmanirbhar” or self-reliance.The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine will be produced by its Indian partner, the Serum Institute of India (SII) – the world’s largest vaccine maker – under the name, Covishield.Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi took to social media to declare that the development made “every Indian proud that the two vaccines” are made in India.But health experts and opposition politicians have questioned the lack of transparency in the approval process.American drugmaker Pfizer was the first to apply for emergency use authorisation in India in early December, but it continues to be under review.Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech have been the COVID-19 vaccine trailblazers, becoming the first vaccine to receive WHO validation for emergency use.Ahmedabad-based Zydus Cadila and Dr Reddy’s Laboratories are among other domestic manufacturers with vaccine candidates under consideration. Dr Reddy’s is partnering with Sputnik V, the Russian vaccine.With more than 10.3 million recorded COVID-19 cases and nearly 150,000 deaths, India is the second-most infected country after the United States.Vaccinating the second most populous country, health experts say, will not be an easy task.The government has released an elaborate vaccine roll-out plan with the vaccination of 300 million of the most vulnerable people in the first phase running from January to August.Those eligible in the first round include 10 million healthcare workers, 20 million front-line workers – policemen, soldiers, municipal and others – and 270 million people above the age of 50.“Nothing has ever been attempted at this scale,” said K Srinath Reddy, President, Public Health Foundation of India (PHFI).The health ministry on December 28 released the updated COVID-19 operational guidelines, a 148-page document detailing different aspects involved in vaccinating the population.It cites India’s experience with the Universal Immunization Program (UIP) which vaccinates more than 50 million people every year against diseases such as measles-rubella and adult Japanese encephalitis (JE).PFHI’s Reddy said that vaccinating healthcare and front-line workers, who can be quickly identified and assembled, is an easier task.“These [UIP campaigns] were done in limited areas and didn’t cover a large part of the population. Japanese encephalitis is limited largely to eastern Uttar Pradesh and Bihar while measles-rubella is generally given to pregnant women,” said Reddy.To test and prepare for the seamless delivery and administration of the vaccine, the government first conducted a two-day dry run in four states on December 28 and 29. On January 2, another exercise was conducted at select hospitals across state capitals and major cities across the country.The government guidelines say India’s successful conduct of the election process will be used as a template to run the vaccination drive. The 2019 general elections saw 900 million voters across the country casting their ballot in seven phases over six weeks.Similar to voting centres, district administrations will identify vaccination session sites to gather those eligible for vaccination. Every session site will be managed by a five-member team of vaccination officers to authenticate identity, administer vaccines and monitor the vaccinated.Instructions suggest that each session will inoculate 100 people daily, increasing the number to 200 if adequate vaccines and logistics are available. The number of such vaccination sites to be set up has been left to the district administrations who will rely on their area’s electoral roll. India has more than 700 districts.Since both the vaccines require two full doses administered around four to six weeks apart, the vaccination sessions will have to be set up twice.About 114,100 vaccinators were trained for the country-wide mock drill. Delhi and Mumbai, major hotspots last year, are gearing up for the task. While Delhi plans to set up 500-600 vaccination sites, Mumbai has identified major hospitals to start gradually increasing the sites to 100.A digital platform, the Covid Vaccine Intelligence Network (Co-WIN), will also be put to use to allow beneficiary registration, session microplanning, real-time reporting of vaccination and issuing of vaccination certificates.More than 7.5 million health officials have already registered on Co-WIN. The app is not yet accessible for other citizens.And to get these databases up and running, state authorities have been instructed to ensure the completion of data collection of “age-based priority groups”.Health is a state responsibility but the pandemic forced the state governments to heavily depend on the central government due to budgetary, capacity and even technical expertise constraints.At the start of the pandemic, the tussle between states and the central government was reflected in difficulties procuring testing kits and financial aid requests.Rajiv Nath, Managing Director of India’s biggest syringe manufacturer, Hindustan Syringes and Medical Devices, says vaccinating 300 million people in the first round is a tough task but not an impossible one.“I was thinking a more probable date would be September but India is like a huge elephant. When it gets up and starts running and charges, there’s no stopping it,” he told Al Jazeera.Nath’s company, which produces 700 million pieces annually, estimates that India would require 1.8 billion different kinds of syringes if 60-70 percent of the population is vaccinated with two shots.Experts say that supply chain logistics and storage are significant challenges, as different vaccines require different storage.Pfizer’s vaccine, for instance, requires storage at -60°C to -90°C, a challenge acknowledged by WHO, making it a tough candidate for distribution in remote areas while significantly increasing the cost.Reddy from PHFI says cold-chain challenges with Pfizer’s vaccine limits its use in more remote areas, perhaps the reason the government is reluctant to purchase it. The two approved vaccines require regular fridge storage.While the health ministry claimed that sufficient storage facilities have been arranged for the first phase of vaccinations until August, there is no clarity on the capacity when the general population will be vaccinated.In mid-December, Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan told reporters that 29,000 cold-chain points, 45,000 ice-lined refrigerators, 41,000 deep freezers, among others, have already reached the states.Pricing is another concern. While Health Minister Harsh Vardhan has said that the vaccines will be free in the first phase, it is not clear what might happen for the general population.It was reported that SII planned to charge the government Rs 200 ($2.70) per dose for the first 100 million doses, and price it at Rs 1,000 [$13.70] for the general public in the open market.

224,WHO grants emergency approval for India’s Covaxin COVID-19 jab,"The World Health Organization (WHO) has issued an emergency use listing for India’s Covaxin vaccine against COVID-19.The jab “is extremely suitable for low – and middle-income countries due to easy storage requirements”, the United Nations’ health agency said in a statement on Wednesday after its Strategic Advisory Group of Experts found it last month to have 78 percent efficacy after two doses spread over four weeks.“This emergency use listing expands the availability of vaccines, the most effective medical tools we have to end the pandemic,” said Mariangela Simao, WHO’s assistant director-general for access to medicines and health products.“But we must keep up the pressure to meet the needs of all populations, giving priority to the at-risk groups who are still waiting for their first dose, before we can start declaring victory,” she added.Glad to see one more vaccine, #Covaxin, being granted @WHO emergency use listing. The more products we have to fight #COVID19, the better, but we must keep up the pressure to deliver #VaccinEquity & prioritize access to vulnerable groups who are still waiting for their 1st dose. https://t.co/wCgtSSNvJ1— Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus (@DrTedros) November 3, 2021Covaxin is the first vaccine completely developed and manufactured in India to receive WHO approval.To date, the health agency has granted emergency approval to the vaccines made by AstraZeneca and its partner, the Serum Institute of India; Pfizer-BioNTech; Moderna; Johnson and Johnson; and the Chinese pharmaceuticals Sinopharm and Sinovac.Nearly 29 percent of people in India have received at least one dose of Covaxin and more than 23 percent of people have received two jabs, according to Our World in Data.Vaccines approved by the WHO can be used as part of the UN-backed COVAX effort to distribute COVID-19 jabs and to share doses with poorer countries.WHO’s emergency use licensing for Covaxin should also mean that millions of Indians immunised with the shot will be allowed to travel internationally by countries that recognise vaccines authorised by the WHO, including Britain, European Union members and Canada.Covaxin was developed by Indian company Bharat Biotech in partnership with the Indian Council of Medical Research, the government’s apex research body.Bharat Biotech welcomed the WHO approval and said it “validates the international safety and quality standards of Covaxin”.The Emergency Use Listing approval by WHO validates the international safety and quality standards of COVAXIN®.

225,India’s Serum Institute seeks approval for COVID-19 vaccine,"New Delhi, India – The Serum Institute of India, the world’s largest vaccine producer by volume, has sought government approval for emergency-use authorisation of the coronavirus vaccine that it has developed in partnership with the University of Oxford and British drugmaker AstraZeneca.“As promised, before the end of 2020, @SerumInstIndia has applied for emergency use authorisation for the first made-in-India vaccine, COVISHIELD,” the company CEO Adar Poonawalla tweeted on Monday.The experimental vaccine can be stored at two to eight degrees Celsius and can be distributed more easily in India, which has the world’s second-highest number of infections at 9.6 million.The company has applied to the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI), with Poonawalla saying the vaccine will “save countless lives” without giving details.The move comes close on the heels of Pfizer Inc applying for a similar authorisation of its coronavirus vaccine in India on Saturday.Last month, Pfizer and BioNTech said their experimental vaccine was 90-percent effective while the US biotech firm Moderna Inc said its COVID-19 vaccine showed 94.5 percent effective in preventing COVID-19.According to Indian media reports, Serum’s application stated that data from four clinical studies, two in the UK and one each in Brazil and India, showed that the vaccine, Covishield, was highly effective against severe COVID-19 infections.Last month, a 40-year-old man from the southern city of Chennai had alleged that he suffered serious “neurological and psychological” symptoms after receiving the vaccine in a trial being run by the Serum Institute of India.But the Indian government last week said it had found no reason to stop the Oxford vaccine trials in India after reviewing the volunteer’s allegation of serious adverse effects. The vaccine is currently in the Phase III clinical trial in India.After a spike in the daily cases last month, India has seen a drop in the daily infections in the past week several weeks.India’s Ministry of Health and Family Welfare on Monday said that 512 people died in the last 24 hours taking the total COVID-19 fatalities to 139,700.On Friday, India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi told an all-party meeting that in next few weeks, Indian manufacturers would be able to produce the much-awaited COVID-19 vaccines.“Experts believe we don’t have to wait for a long period to get a vaccine. It is understood that in next few weeks, Covid vaccines will be ready. The government is waiting for a go-ahead from the scientists,” Modi said during the virtual meeting with leaders from different parties.He also said that eight COVID-19 vaccines are at different stages of preparedness in India which includes the three indigenous vaccines that are at different stages of trials.Phase three trials of India’s first indigenous vaccine started last month. Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech company has been developing the vaccine, Covaxin, in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) – India’s premier medical research body.“The world is looking at a cheap but effective vaccine against COVID-19. The world is looking at India. You can be assured our scientists are working hard,” he said.Last month, AstraZeneca said it might have to run an additional global trial to assess the efficacy of its COVID-19 vaccine, after concerns were raised about the effectiveness of its jab. Earlier, the British company said their drug had proved on average 70-percent effective.Experts warn that before rolling out any vaccine, it should pass through scientific scrutiny.“Before the government rolls out the vaccine, it must be very much clear to the public – the whole process, the vaccine manufacturing and everything should come out in the scientific papers. It should be provided to the scientific community to scrutinise to see whether they (manufacturers) have rushed to make the vaccine just to get a monetary benefit or just to save the government’s face,” said former president of AIIMS Resident Doctors’ Association (RDA) Harjit Singh Bhatti.“First it must be done on papers and should given to the scientific community to scrutinise and once it gets approved from the scientific community also, it has build up a confidence in the minds of people, then only a vaccine should come out for public use,” he told Al Jazeera.Dr Jayaprakash Muliyil, an epidemiologist at the Christian Medical College in southern state of Tamil Nadu, added that it would not be an easy task to carry out the vaccination drive across India.“It will be logistically very difficult for India to take the vaccine to every village,” he said, adding that the distribution drive “needs a lot of training and the cold chain support needs to be very strong”.He however, said that a trial should be carried out before using any foreign-made vaccine like Pfizer.“The regulatory business in India demands that we test it here on Indian population. We need to look for evidence whether this particular vaccine is going to behave the same way in India as it does in other countries,” Muliyil told Al Jazeera.Bilal Kuchay contributed to the report from New Delhi",Covaxin,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/12/7/indias-serum-institute-seeks-emergency-use-nod-for-covid-vaccine,AL JAZEERA,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""source"", ""reason"": ""The article relies heavily on quotes from Indian officials and experts, while only mentioning concerns about the vaccine's efficacy in a single sentence.

226,Brazil scrambles to secure COVID vaccine from India,"Brazil made a diplomatic push on Monday to guarantee an Indian-made shipment of British drugmaker AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 vaccine, hoping to avoid export restrictions that could delay immunisations during the world’s second-deadliest outbreak.In parallel, Brazil’s private clinics struck a preliminary deal for an alternative injection made by India’s Bharat Biotech despite a lack of public results from late-stage trials.The scramble by Brazil’s government and private sector underscored how Latin America’s largest nation, once an example of mass immunisation success in the developing world, has fallen behind peers in the race to inoculate against the coronavirus.Plans by Brazil’s Fiocruz Institute to import AstraZeneca’s vaccine in bulk, filling and finishing doses locally, would only have one million doses ready by the second week of February, the head of the government-funded biomedical centre told Reuters last week.Amid rising criticism of its slow response and a death toll approaching 200,000, second only to the United States, Brazil is now rushing to import finished doses, playing catch up to neighboring Chile and Argentina where inoculations are under way.However, the chief executive of the Serum Institute of India told the Reuters news agency on Sunday he expected India’s government to restrict the export of COVID-19 vaccines.That raised red flags in Brasilia, where health regulator Anvisa had granted approval on New Year’s Eve to import two million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine from India. Two people familiar with the matter said diplomats were working to confirm the shipment would not be affected by any export ban. Fiocruz confirmed that Brazil’s Foreign Ministry was leading the talks.Separately, an association of private Brazilian clinics announced plans to buy five million doses of a vaccine developed by Indian company Bharat Biotech, a day after India’s health regulator gave it emergency use approval.Bharat Biotech has not yet applied for approval by Brazil’s health regulator Anvisa for its Covaxin vaccine, and the agency said it would have to undergo phase three trials in the country.Geraldo Barbosa, head of the Brazilian Association of Vaccine Clinics (ABCVAC), who will lead a delegation to India departing on Monday, said a memorandum of understanding has already been signed with Bharat Biotech.“This should be the first vaccine available on the private market in Brazil,” he said, adding that the Covaxin doses should arrive in Brazil in mid-March, to be sold by private clinics after regulators there approve the vaccine.Anvisa said in a statement on Sunday Covaxin does not fit the continuous data submission process for vaccine registration and the vaccine would have to undergo late phase clinical trials in Brazil.On Sunday, India’s drugs regulator DCGI approved Covaxin and AstraZeneca’s vaccine for emergency use, the first approvals of vaccines in India.The fast-tracking of the homegrown Bharat Biotech vaccine faced questions from industry experts and opposition legislators because the company has not published efficacy data.Covaxin is undergoing late stage trials in the largest such trial in India. A spokeswoman for Bharat Biotech said 24,000 volunteers have been recruited out of a target of 26,000 for the phase three trial, which began in November.The pharmaceutical company, based in Hyderabad in southern India, produces millions of doses of vaccines for hepatitis, Zika, Japanese encephalitis and other illnesses.Brazil is also in late-stage trials of China’s Sinovac vaccine.",Covaxin,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/1/4/brazil-scrambles-to-secure-covid-vaccine-from-india,AL JAZEERA,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""source"", ""reason"": ""The article relies heavily on sources from India (Bharat Biotech, Serum Institute of India) and Brazil's government, while only mentioning Anvisa's skepticism about Covaxin without providing a counter-source."", ""confidence"": 0.8}",no,none,no source bias
227,"India, ‘pharmacy of the world’, starts exporting COVID vaccines","India has started exporting coronavirus vaccines with a shipment to the neighbouring Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said, as the so-called “pharmacy of the world” looks to bolster its vaccine diplomacy.Many low and middle-income countries are relying on India, the world’s biggest vaccine maker, for supplies to start COVID-19 immunisation programmes and bring an end to their outbreaks.“First consignment takes off for Bhutan!” MEA spokesman Anurag Srivastava said on Twitter on Wednesday. “India begins supply of Covid vaccines to its neighbouring and key partner countries.”The ministry said on Tuesday “supplies under grant assistance” would be shipped to the Maldives, Bangladesh, Nepal, Myanmar and Seychelles, while Sri Lanka, Afghanistan and Mauritius await regulatory clearances to receive the vaccines.“The Pharmacy of the World will deliver to overcome the COVID challenge,” Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar posted on Twitter, referring to the exports.Indian firms produce about half of the world’s vaccine supply, mostly for developing nations, according to the Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance.India will also provide training for personnel involved in the vaccine roll-out in all the neighbouring countries.India authorised two vaccines this month for emergency use at home, one licensed from Oxford University and AstraZeneca and another developed at home by Bharat Biotech in partnership with the state-run Indian Council of Medical Research. Both are manufactured locally.However, Bharat Biotech on Tuesday warned people with weak immunity and other medical conditions including allergies, fever or a bleeding disorder to consult a doctor before getting the shot – and if possible avoid the vaccine.The company said those receiving vaccinations should disclose their medical condition, medicines they are taking and any history of allergies. It said severe allergic reactions among vaccine recipients may include difficulty breathing, swelling of the face and throat, rapid heartbeat, body rashes, dizziness and weakness.The Bharat Biotech vaccine, called Covaxin, ran into controversy after the Indian government allowed its use without concrete data showing its effectiveness in preventing COVID-19.At least two other vaccines are expected to be authorised by India in the next few months.India will initially ship only the AstraZeneca vaccine, made by the Serum Institute of India, the world’s biggest vaccine maker, which brands the shot as Covishield.Bangladesh said it expected to receive a gift of two million doses of Covishield on Thursday. The country of more than 160 million has yet to start its vaccination programme and has ordered a further 30 million doses of the shot.India, which has reported the highest number of coronavirus infections after the United States, has vaccinated more than 631,417 front-line workers after the nationwide drive began on Saturday.The world’s second-most populous country on Wednesday reported 13,823 new cases, taking the total to 10.9 million.

228,India prepares for COVID vaccine roll-out from Saturday,"India aims to begin vaccinating its 1.3 billion people against coronavirus from Saturday, a colossal and complex task compounded by safety worries, shaky infrastructure and public scepticism.In one of the world’s biggest roll-outs, the world’s second most populous nation hopes to inoculate 300 million people – equal almost to the population of the United States – by July.First to get one of two vaccines granted “emergency approval” will be 30 million health and other front-line workers, followed by around 270 million people aged over 50 or deemed high-risk all over the vast nation.On 16th January, India takes a landmark step forward in fighting COVID-19. Starting that day, India’s nation-wide vaccination drive begins. Priority will be given to our brave doctors, healthcare workers, frontline workers including Safai Karamcharis. https://t.co/P5Arw64wVt— Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) January 9, 2021About 150,000 staff in 700 districts have been specially trained, and India has held several national dry runs involving mock transportation of vaccines and dummy injections.Authorities will use the experience from holding elections in the world’s biggest democracy, and from regular child immunisation programmes for polio and tuberculosis.But in an enormous, impoverished nation with often shoddy transport networks and one of the world’s worst funded healthcare systems, the undertaking is still daunting.Regular child inoculations are a “much smaller game” and vaccinating against COVID-19 will be “deeply challenging”, said Satyajit Rath from the National Institute of Immunology.The two vaccines approved by India – Oxford University and AstraZeneca’s Covishield, made by local partner the Serum Institute of India, and Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin – need to be kept refrigerated at all times.A total of 29,000 cold-chain points, 240 walk-in coolers, 70 walk-in freezers, 45,000 ice-lined refrigerators, 41,000 deep freezers and 300 solar refrigerators are at the ready.India has four “mega depots” to take delivery of the vaccines and transport them to state distribution hubs in temperature-controlled vans, but the final leg will be tough.In one recent exercise in rural Uttar Pradesh – where summer temperatures exceed 40 degrees Celsius (105 Fahrenheit) – a health worker was pictured transporting boxes of dummy vials on his bicycle.In Indian-administered Kashmir, currently being pummelled by snowstorms, databases of priority groups – and of staff to administer the vaccines – were still being prepared last week, officials said.During the last dry run on Friday, workers at one health centre in Bangalore had to use a cellphone hotspot to go online because their network was down.There are also concerns about the government’s aim to manage the entire process digitally via its own app, CoWIN, of which there are already several fake versions.As of Monday, it also remained unclear whether the government has yet to agree to a price per jab with the Serum Institute.Tens of millions of shots are reportedly sitting at Serum’s factory in the western city of Pune waiting for an agreement before a fleet of refrigerated trucks can take them to the airport.More than 150,000 Indians have died from COVID-19 and the economy is one of the worst hit worldwide, with millions losing their livelihoods.“I look forward to getting the vaccine and living without fear and the mask all the time,” migrant worker Shatrughan Sharma, 43, told AFP in the capital, New Delhi. “The last year was very tough for us.”But like in other countries, there is scepticism about the vaccine, fuelled by a torrent of misinformation online.A recent survey of 18,000 people across India found that 69 percent were in no rush to get a COVID-19 shot.Public trust was not helped by Bharat Biotech’s indigenous vaccine being controversially given “restricted approval” without data from phase three human trials.Plans by Serum to sell the AstraZeneca jab privately to Indian individuals and firms for 1,000 rupees ($14) has also raised fears that the rich will get inoculated sooner.“There will be a long wait for poor people like me as the rich and well-off will get it first,” Suresh Paswan, a rickshaw puller in Patna in the eastern province of Bihar told AFP news agency.",Covaxin,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/1/11/india-prepares-for-covid-vaccine-roll-out-from-saturday,AL JAZEERA,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""tonality"", ""reason"": ""The article's tone is generally neutral, but it uses words like 'shaky infrastructure', 'public scepticism', and 'daunting' to describe the challenges of vaccine roll-out.

Your administration has the details. 🙏🙏— Adar Poonawalla (@adarpoonawalla) April 16, 2021The SII is making the AstraZeneca shot, which accounts for more than 91 percent of the 115.5 million doses given in the country. The company will soon start producing the Novavax vaccine.Poonawalla’s appeal came as India’s daily COVID-19 vaccinations slowed from their peak early this month while new infections have set a record, government data showed on Friday.India has reported the most number of coronavirus cases in the world this month. Its total of 14.3 million is the most after the US, with 174,308 deaths.Amid the spike and after giving and selling tens of millions of COVID-19 vaccine doses abroad, India has suddenly found itself short of the drug.It has abruptly changed rules to allow it to fast-track vaccine imports, having earlier rebuffed foreign drugmakers like Pfizer.Vaccinations peaked at 4.5 million doses on April 5 but have averaged about three million a day since then, according to the government’s Co-Win portal to coordinate immunisations.Many vaccination centres in India are now rationing supplies, though it is only inoculating people above 45 years, having started the campaign in mid-January with front-line workers.It has administered the most doses in the world after the US and China, but it ranks much lower per capita.Many states have sought an expansion of the immunisation drive to include all adults, but the government has said doses are “finite”.The government said on Friday the country had a stock of about 30 million doses. Going by its vaccination trend in the past week, that will be enough for 10 days.India this week gave emergency authorisation to Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine and imports to cover as many as 125 million people will start this month. The government has also urged Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson and Johnson to sell their shots to India.It has also allowed biomedical research body Haffkine Institute, based in the state of Maharashtra, to produce the home-grown shot Covaxin as developer Bharat Biotech struggles to boost its output.",Covaxin,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/4/16/indias-covid-vaccine-maker-urges-biden-to-lift-exports-embargo,AL JAZEERA,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""source"", ""reason"": ""The article relies heavily on the Serum Institute of India's CEO Adar Poonawalla's tweet and statement, without providing a counter-perspective from the US government or other relevant sources."", ""confidence"": 0.8}",no,none,no source bias
230,India to prioritise Sri Lanka when COVID vaccine ready for export,"India’s foreign minister has told Sri Lanka’s president that the country will be prioritised when Indian-produced COVID-19 vaccines are ready for export, the president’s office said.Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar made the pledge in a meeting with Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa in response to the president’s request for vaccines produced in India, Rajapaksa’s office said in a statement on Wednesday.“We are now looking at post-COVID cooperation and I carry back with me Sri Lanka’s interest in accessing vaccines from India,” said Jaishankar.His Sri Lankan counterpart Dinesh Gunawardena said India’s “‘Neighbourhood First’ policy made a very positive impact on our health sector and the economy during the critical period, unprecedented crisis”.India’s drug regulator has approved two vaccines for emergency use for COVID-19 – one developed by Oxford University and United Kingdom-based drug maker AstraZeneca, and another by the Indian manufacturer Bharat Biotech.Serum Institute of India, the world’s largest vaccine manufacturing company, has been contracted by AstraZeneca to make one billion doses for developing nations, including India.However, delivery of the vaccine outside India is likely to take a number of months.COVID-19 cases have spiked in Sri Lanka in recent months. At least 217 people have died.However, authorities were undecided on a vaccine until last month.Jaishankar, who is on a two-day visit to Sri Lanka, also reiterated India’s backing for Sri Lanka’s reconciliation process and an “inclusive political outlook” that encourages ethnic harmony.The Indo-Sri Lanka Accord signed in 1987 called for the devolution of power to Sri Lanka’s Tamil minority regions and resulted in the 13th Amendment to the Sri Lankan constitution, which created provincial councils with a degree of decentralised power.“It is in Sri Lanka’s own interest that the expectations of the Tamil people for equality, justice, peace and dignity within a united Sri Lanka are fulfilled,” he said.India in 1987 intervened to end the civil war between Sri Lankan government forces and minority ethnic Tamil rebels. Sri Lankan Tamils have familial, linguistic and cultural ties with Tamils in South India.India sent a peacekeeping force to implement the agreement but ended up fighting with the rebels before returning home with heavy losses.In 1991, a suspected Tamil Tiger suicide bomber killed former Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, who had signed the agreement.Sri Lankan government forces crushed the rebels in 2009, ending a 26-year civil war that killed at least 100,000 people, according to the United Nations.Successive Sri Lankan governments have pledged to India that they will share more power with the Tamils to ensure peace, but President Rajapaksa, who was elected last November, has rejected the idea.",Covaxin,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/1/7/india-to-prioritise-sri-lanka-when-covid-vaccine-ready-for-export,AL JAZEERA,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""source"", ""reason"": ""The article relies on the Indian Foreign Minister's statement and the Sri Lankan President's office for information, without providing a counter-source or alternative perspective."", ""confidence"": 0.8}",no,none,no source bias
231,India to offer COVID booster shots to all adults from Sunday,"India will offer booster doses of COVID-19 vaccine to all adults from Sunday as the number of new virus cases in the country drops sharply.The free third doses of the vaccine will be limited to front-line workers and those older than 60 who get them at government centres.The country has given 1.85 billion vaccine doses among its population of 1.35 billion. Of these, 82 percent are the AstraZeneca vaccine, made domestically and called Covishield.The ministry said those who had taken their second dose nine months ago would be eligible for the shot, which they will have to pay for at private facilities with no mixing and matching of vaccines allowed.“Adding an extra layer of safety,” Health Minister Mansukh Mandaviya said in a Twitter post flagging the decision.The booster programme started in January and was limited to front-line workers and the elderly, administering a total of 24 million doses.Other vaccines used in India are the domestically developed Covaxin and Corbevax and Russia’s Sputnik V.In March, reports said India was considering making all adults eligible for booster doses at a time of growing infections in some countries, while some Indians found it hard to travel abroad without a third dose.The South Asian country has recorded a steep dip in coronavirus cases in recent weeks, with the health ministry reporting approximately 1,100 cases on Friday.India remains the world’s third-worst affected nation by the virus after the United States and Brazil.More than 521,000 people have died, and at least 40 million have been infected across the country since the pandemic began in January 2020, according to official figures.At least 4,000 people were dying every day at the height of the pandemic in India between March and May last year, according to official figures, which are widely thought to be underestimated.",Covaxin,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/4/9/india-to-offer-covid-booster-shots-to-all-adults-from-sunday,AL JAZEERA,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""omission"", ""reason"": ""No mention of Covaxin's efficacy or potential issues compared to other vaccines."", ""confidence"": 0.8}",no,none,no omission bias is in scope here
232,India gives emergency approval for world’s first COVID-19 DNA jab,"India’s drug regulator has granted emergency use approval for Zydus Cadila’s COVID-19 vaccine, the world’s first DNA shot against the coronavirus, in adults and children aged 12 years and above.The approval gives a boost to India’s vaccination programme, which aims to inoculate all eligible adults by December, and will provide the first shot for those below 18, as the country still struggles to contain the virus spread in some states.The vaccine, ZyCoV-D, uses a section of genetic material from the virus that gives instructions as either DNA or RNA to make the specific protein that the immune system recognises and responds to.Unlike most COVID-19 vaccines, which need two doses or even a single dose, ZyCoV-D is administered in three doses.The generic drugmaker, listed as Cadila Healthcare Ltd, aims to make 100 million to 120 million doses of ZyCoV-D annually and has already begun stockpiling the vaccine.Zydus Cadila’s vaccine, developed in partnership with the Department of Biotechnology, is the second home-grown shot to get emergency authorisation in India after Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin.The drugmaker said in July its COVID-19 vaccine was effective against the new coronavirus mutants, especially the Delta variant, and that the shot is administered using a needle-free applicator as opposed to traditional syringes.The regulatory nod makes ZyCoV-D the sixth vaccine authorised for use in the country where only about 9.18 percent of the entire population has been fully vaccinated so far, according to Johns Hopkins University data.Zydus Cadila had also submitted data evaluating a two-dose regimen for the shot in July and plans to seek regulatory approval for the same.The firm had applied for the authorisation of ZyCoV-D on July 1, based on an efficacy rate of 66.6 percent in a late-stage trial of more than 28,000 volunteers nationwide.",Covaxin,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/8/20/india-gives-emergency-approval-for-worlds-first-covid-19-dna-jab,AL JAZEERA,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""source"", ""reason"": ""The article relies on a press release from Zydus Cadila and quotes the company's statements without providing counter-sources or critical perspectives."", ""confidence"": 0.8}",no,none,no source bias
233,India records this year’s worst single-day spike in COVID cases,"India has recorded 26,291 new coronavirus cases, its highest single-day spike this year, taking the total caseload to 11,385,339, according to official data.The number of deaths linked with COVID-19 increased to 158,725 with 118 more fatalities being recorded on the day, the federal health ministry update said on Monday.India, which has the largest virus caseload after the United States and Brazil, saw a downward trend in infections at the end of 2020, but the numbers have been rising again in recent weeks.As warned earlier, #Covid19 continues to be a big threat.Please keep the guards up- wear masks and follow all precautions. pic.twitter.com/IBgA4N0Dx7— Rahul Gandhi (@RahulGandhi) March 15, 2021The western state of Maharashtra, which has been a virus hotspot since the outbreak last year, accounted for 16,620 new infections.The number of infections on Monday was the highest daily rise in 85 days since December 20 when as many as 26,624 new infections were recorded, according to data on the Johns Hopkins University website.There are concerns about a second wave of the pandemic in India with medical experts suggesting that new variants of the virus as well as poor adherence to safety norms could be behind the surge in cases.Besides Maharashtra, which imposed partial lockdowns and restrictions to contain infections, four more states, including Punjab, Karnataka, Gujarat and Tamil Nadu, were reporting an upward trend in cases.India expanded its COVID-19 vaccination drive from March 1 to cover people over 60 years of age, after launching the campaign mid-January by inoculating front-line workers and healthcare staff.Almost 30 million doses have been administered so far, but experts say the pace of vaccinations needs to be accelerated to meet the government’s target of inoculating 300 million people by early August.",Covaxin,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/3/15/india-records-this-years-worst-single-day-spike-in-covid-cases,AL JAZEERA,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""tonality"", ""reason"": ""The article's tone is cautionary and alarmist, using words like 'big threat' and emphasizing the need for precautions."", ""confidence"": 0.8}",no,none,no tonality bias
234,India orders 300m COVID shots as court demands vaccine ‘roadmap’,"India’s government has signed its first purchase order for unapproved COVID-19 vaccines, a day after it faced criticism from the top court about an “arbitrary and irrational” vaccine rollout that has left millions of people vulnerable.After a devastating second wave of infections that killed tens of thousands in April and May, the focus has shifted to urgently inoculating India’s vast adult population to curb infections later this year.The government will buy 300 million doses from local firm Biological-E and has put down an advance of $205.6m, the health ministry said, even though the vaccine is still undergoing phase-3 clinical trials before approvals can be given.“The arrangement with M/s Biological-E is part of the wider endeavour of Government of India to encourage indigenous vaccine manufacturers by providing them support in Research & Development (R&D) and also financial support,” the ministry said in a statement on Thursday.India has been inoculating people with the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine produced locally at the Serum Institute of India (SII), Covaxin made by local firm Bharat Biotech, and has begun rolling out Russia’s Sputnik V.But supplies are running low after the government opened vaccinations to adults of all ages last month. Some vaccination centres have had to close down, prompting criticism from the Supreme Court about a lack of proper planning.While the federal government gave free vaccines to the elderly and front-line workers, it left it to state governments and private hospitals to administer doses to people in the 18-44 age group at a pre-determined price.“The policy of the central government for conducting free vaccination themselves for groups under the first two phases, and replacing it with paid vaccination… is, prima facie, arbitrary and irrational,” the Supreme Court said.Younger people were just as vulnerable, as the second wave of infections had shown, the court said.It asked the government to review its vaccination policy, produce a roadmap, and said the court would not stand by when citizens’ constitutional rights were at risk.So far, about 4.7 percent of the country’s 950 million adult population have been given both doses.The government said this week supplies are improving and it could have as many as 10 million doses a day in July and August, up from just under three million now.The SII has sought regulatory approval to make Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine, a senior government official said, on top of the Oxford-AstraZeneca and Novavax Inc shots it is already producing.The federal drugs regulator did not immediately respond to a Reuters news agency’s email seeking comment.India on Thursday announced 134,154 new COVID-19 infections over the past 24 hours, still high but down more than 65 percent from a peak of 414,188 reported on May 7.The official recorded caseload since the start of the pandemic now stands at 28.4 million, second only to the United States in terms of total infections. Casualties so far number 337,989.Health experts have warned of a third wave in a few months as restrictions brought on by the second wave are eased and have underlined that vaccinating a large percentage of the population is the only way forward.",Covaxin,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/6/3/india-orders-300m-covid-shots-as-court-asks-for-vaccine-roadmap,AL JAZEERA,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""omission"", ""reason"": ""The article does not mention the Covaxin vaccine's efficacy or safety record, only its approval status and production by Bharat Biotech."", ""confidence"": 0.8}",no,none,no omission bias is in scope here
235,"As India switches COVID vaccine policy, shortage of jabs remains","Starting from Monday, every Indian adult can get a COVID-19 vaccine dose, that was purchased by the federal government, for free.The policy reversal, announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi last week, ends a complex system of buying vaccines that worsened inequities in administering the shots.India is a key supplier of vaccines around the world, and its missteps have left millions of people unprotected. Less than five percent of Indians are fully vaccinated.While the policy change is likely to address inequality, questions remain over the distribution of the vaccines. Moreover, poor planning means vaccine shortages will likely continue.Here’s a look at the changes to India’s vaccine policy and what it means:A massive virus surge in March pushed India’s health systems to breaking point. Hundreds of thousands of people were newly infected each day, hospitals overflowed with patients gasping for air and nighttime skies glowed as busy crematoria burned bodies in the open air.At the time, India was vaccinating those most vulnerable for free, but states flagged shortages.Vaccinations were opened to all adults in May, but Modi’s government switched from taking the lead on vaccine availability to try to get them distributed to where they were most needed.Instead, the federal government would buy half of all vaccines made and would continue giving free shots to 300 million healthcare and front-line workers, along with those older than 45.States and private hospitals would split the remaining shots to vaccinate more than 600 million adults younger than 45.However, experts warned that vaccine makers might prioritise sales to the private sector to reap more profits.One state health minister said the Serum Institute of India, which is making the AstraZeneca vaccine mostly used in India, would not respond to the state’s inquiries.India has one of the largest immunisation programmes in the world and each year 300 million shots are given to infants and mothers.But states have never bought vaccines before. And a limited supply meant states were competing with each other, while paying a higher price than what the federal government could have negotiated, said Dr Chandrakant Lahariya, a health policy expert.“That essentially makes it inefficient,” he said.When India started vaccinations, it aimed to prioritise health workers, essential workers and older people. But expanding the criteria despite shortages created inequities.Since May, more people younger than 45 have received their first shot than those older than 60. More than 74 million people older than 60 remain unvaccinated.Modi said these decisions were taken to accommodate states, but the fractured response may have cost lives, said Dr Vineeta Bal, who studies immune systems at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research in the western city of Pune.The federal government said it will buy 75 percent of all vaccines made by Indian vaccine makers and likely renegotiate prices. These shots will now be given to states to be distributed for free.Private hospitals can buy the remaining 25 percent at prices that have been capped.States will receive the vaccines based on their population, disease burden and how many people have been vaccinated, while wasted doses will be penalised.But the biggest challenge will be to ensure a continuous supply. Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said, “Where will the vaccines come from is a big question.”India ordered 300 million shots of vaccine candidate Biological E for $205.62m in its first agreement to secure shots in advance. But it is still being tested and has not been approved, so likely will not make a difference to supplies until later this year.And with only one such deal made so far, experts do not think India’s reliance on its existing, overstretched suppliers like the Serum Institute will end soon.Meanwhile, private hospitals do not yet know how they will procure vaccines under the new policy, and some say they are unlikely to continue organising neighbourhood vaccine drives since prices had been capped.",Covaxin,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/6/18/india-covid-vaccine-policy-shortage,AL JAZEERA,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""omission"", ""reason"": ""The article does not mention the Covaxin vaccine, which is a key part of India's vaccination efforts, despite being mentioned in the event context universe."", ""confidence"": 0.8}",yes,omission,"does not mention the Covaxin vaccine, which is a key part of India's vaccination efforts, despite being mentioned in the event context universe."

237,India asks states to step up COVID testing over Omicron,"India’s health ministry says the states should ramp up COVID-19 testing as the world battles the new coronavirus variant Omicron, while some cities have delayed the reopening of schools as a precautionary measure.The ministry on Tuesday also said the Omicron variant “doesn’t escape RT-PCR and RAT (testing)”, appeasing some concerns among domestic health workers that changes in the spike protein of the virus could lead to conventional tests failing to detect the mutation.It comes as the ministry warned the state governments last week that a recent fall in testing could undermine India’s efforts to contain the pandemic.While India has not reported any Omicron cases yet, authorities are studying the sample of a man who tested positive for COVID-19 after recently returning from South Africa to see if he is infected with the Omicron or another variant.Also on Tuesday, Mumbai’s municipal corporation said it was delaying reopening schools for younger children to December 15 instead of Wednesday as a precautionary measure given the global situation involving Omicron.In-person classes for senior students began about two months ago in the city.The city of Pune, which is also located in the western state of Maharashtra, has also postponed the reopening of schools, local media reported.K Srinath Reddy, president of the Public Health Foundation of India, told Al Jazeera the new COVID-19 variant has some features which are of concern but there may be one feature “which may be somewhat reassuring”.“The two features that are of concern are that because of very high number of spike protein mutations, it’s likely to be much more infectious than the previous variants. Because of the spike protein mutations, it may also be able to partially at least evade the immunity that has been produced by vaccines which has been predominantly focused on the spike protein,” he said.“The reassuring feature is that so far, reports coming from South Africa and Europe suggest that it’s a very mild form of illness. If that is so, even if it’s more infectious and will cause a lot of problems in terms of number of cases going to be infected and requiring medical attention, the pressure on hospitals may be less, and serious illnesses and deaths may be less compared to the Delta variant.”“Whether it will replace Delta and become a milder form is something that we have to wait and see. Since we still do not know enough about this variant, we have to keep all systems in readiness and be ready and prepared to face a serious wave,” he added.After battling a record jump in infections and deaths in April and May, cases have come down substantially in India.Its COVID-19 cases rose by 8,954 on Wednesday. It was 6,990 on Tuesday – the smallest increase in 551 days.India’s totally coronavirus tally is nearly 35 million, with only the United States reporting more infections. Deaths on Wednesday rose by 267, taking the total to 469,247, health ministry data showed.But there have been concerns over India’s vaccination drive amid the discovery of the Omicron variant of the coronavirus.“I wouldn’t say that we are really prepared because our vaccination drive is stumbling and that is going to be a major challenge,” health economist Rijo M John told Al Jazeera.“I am worried about people above 45 years of age. Only 58 percent of the population above 45 has been given two doses of the vaccine,” he said.“If the Omicron variant turns out to be more problematic or leads to more serious diseases, then this is the population that needs to be highly worried.”Meanwhile, India’s Bharat Biotech said on Tuesday it was studying if its Covaxin shot would work against variants of coronavirus such as Omicron, after the CEO of drugmaker Moderna warned that existing vaccines would be less effective.“Covaxin was developed against the original Wuhan variant,” a Bharat Biotech spokesperson told Reuters in a text message, referring to the Chinese city where the virus first emerged.“It has shown that it can work against other variants, including the Delta variant.

238,"India crosses 300,000 COVID deaths; vaccine drive hit by shortage","India has crossed 300,000 coronavirus deaths, the third country after the United States and Brazil to hit the grim figure, as it battles a huge second wave of infections now affecting the poorer countryside.India’s health ministry on Monday reported 4,454 coronavirus-related deaths over the last 24 hours, with the total death toll now standing at 303,720 after adding 50,000 deaths in just under two weeks.Daily coronavirus infections rose by 222,315, taking the country’s caseload to 26.75 million, according to the health ministry data.The milestone came as slowed vaccine deliveries mar the country’s fight against the pandemic, forcing many to miss their shots, and a rare “black fungus” infection affecting COVID-19 patients worrying the doctors.Many experts however believe the real toll is much higher, particularly as the disease spreads into rural areas where the majority of the 1.35 billion population lives and where health facilities and record-keeping is poor.Al Jazeera’s Elizabeth Puranam, reporting from New Delhi, said Indian journalists, doctors and crematoriums all say many deaths are not being counted.“The official death toll only takes into account people who are dying in hospitals, but most Indians don’t die in hospitals, they die at home. And only around 22 percent of deaths in the country are medically certified,” she said.Several Indian states have halted the COVID-19 vaccination drive for those in the 18-44 age group due to a shortage of vaccine supplies, regional officials confirmed on Sunday.States where vaccinations for this age group have been stopped include Chhattisgarh, New Delhi, Karnakata, Maharashtra and Rajasthan – all among the worst-affected by a current second wave of the pandemic.“The vaccination drive is not going well at all. There are very severe shortages of vaccines and the (federal) government has told states to make their own arrangements with vaccine manufacturers, both local and foreign,” said Al Jazeera’s Puranam.People aged 45 and above are also finding it difficult to get their second dose in several regions, with a number of vaccination centres remaining closed in cities like New Delhi, Mumbai and Pune. Signs posted outside these centres said supplies had run out.“Delhi is also running short of Covaxin doses for the 45-plus age group, we have supplies for just one more day, we have a week’s supply of Covishield,” said Atishi of Delhi’s ruling Aam Aadmi Party.The country began inoculating its 1.3 billion population on January 16 with the two vaccines approved by its drugs regulator.These are Covishield, which is the name under which the AstraZeneca vaccine is produced in India by the Pune-based Serum Institute of India, and Covaxin, manufactured by Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech.The government had planned to vaccinate 300 million people by July but a little more than 195 million shots have been administered so far. Only 43 million people have received the required two shots.The number of vaccines being administered daily has dropped during the past month from 3.2 million doses on April 26 to 2.4 million on May 11 and to 1.5 million on Saturday, government data showed.“Vaccination is really the only answer and Indians are already paying a heavy price for the way the government has gone about planning, pricing and the rollout,” said virologist Dr T Jacob John.Federal government representatives have said the glitch in vaccine supplies was temporary and there would be around two billion doses of vaccines available between June and December.However experts say the government is not likely to hit that goal, pointing out that four of the vaccines the government was basing its projections on are still in the clinical trials stage.“We don’t know whether those would be licenced and when,” epidemiologist Dr Chandrakant Lahariya was quoted as saying by The Hindu newspaper.Lahariya said a realistic estimate of vaccine availability between August and December this year would be around 1.3 billion doses.",Covaxin,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/5/24/india-crosses-300000-covid-deaths-vaccine-drive-hit-by-shortage,AL JAZEERA,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""omission"", ""reason"": ""The article does not mention the government's efforts to address the vaccine shortage or provide a balanced view of the situation.

239,India starts COVID booster shots for the vulnerable as cases rise,"India has begun administering booster doses of COVID-19 vaccine to front-line workers and vulnerable elderly people, with the fast-spreading Omicron variant driving an almost eight-fold rise in daily infections since the start of the year.India reported 179,723 new cases on Monday, most of them in the country’s biggest cities – New Delhi, Mumbai and Kolkata – where Omicron has overtaken Delta as the most prevalent strain of the virus.There were 146 deaths reported on Monday, bringing the toll to 483,936 since the pandemic first struck India in early 2020. Only the United States and Brazil have recorded more deaths.In recent days, hundreds of healthcare and front-line workers, including police, have contracted the virus, and there were media reports that hundreds of parliamentary staff have also tested positive ahead of a budget session on February 1.Facing this rising third wave of infections, the government sent booster reminders to more than 10 million people who took their second dose of the Covaxin or Covishield shot nine months ago.Unlike many countries, India is not mixing and matching vaccines.Only healthcare personnel, front-line workers and people above 60 years suffering from other health conditions are eligible for what the government calls a “precaution dose”.“The government is committed to provide additional security cover to healthcare and frontline workers on priority,” Health Minister Mansukh Mandaviya wrote on Twitter.Despite the rise in infections, five states including the most populous Uttar Pradesh will hold regional elections starting February 10, though authorities have barred political party rallies until at least the middle of this month.Tasked with protecting India’s near 1.4 billion people from the virus, the government has administered 1.5 billion vaccine doses in total. About 67 percent of the country’s 939 million adults have been double vaccinated and many have antibodies from previous infections.This may provide “hybrid immunity” – a combination of immunity from previous infections and vaccines – comparable to boosters, said Dr Chandrakant Lahariya, an Indian epidemiologist.India’s hospitals are short-staffed at the best of times and health workers are distributed unevenly across states.Already, hospitals are becoming crippled as hundreds of health workers fall sick with the variant. Federal hospitals have been forced to relax quarantine rules and some have stopped routine services.“Every third doctor is either symptomatic or positive. There is an acute shortage of staff. And there is an acute crisis,” said Dr Anuj Aggarwal at New Delhi’s Safdarjung Hospital, one of India’s largest government hospitals.At the Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences in Ranchi city, the capital of Jharkhand state in the east, a quarter of the 800 health workers were down with mild infections, said Dr Prabhat Kumar, in charge of COVID-19 treatment there.The delay in providing boosters could be costly, said Dr T Jacob John, the former chief of virology at Christian Medical College in southern India. He said that having to administer third shots as a surge threatens to overwhelm hospitals would put an additional burden on health workers.India’s overall COVID-19 testing has remained at about 1.5 million a day, well below the capacity of more than two million.Since the pandemic began, India has recorded 35.7 million cases of COVID-19, the highest in the world after the US.Government officials have privately said they are working under the assumption that daily infections will surpass the record of more than 414,000 set in May, based on what has happened in countries like the US, where daily cases have risen past one million.",Covaxin,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/1/10/india-covid-cases-vulnerable-vaccine-booster-shots,AL JAZEERA,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""omission"", ""reason"": ""Lack of critical perspective on government's handling of the pandemic and vaccination strategy.

240,India reports another record daily rise in COVID infections,"India has reported a record daily increase of 217,353 COVID-19 infections over the last 24 hours, health ministry data showed – the eighth record daily increase in the last nine days.Deaths from COVID-19 rose by 1,185 – the highest single-day rise in seven months – to reach a total of 174,308, the health ministry’s data showed on Friday.With a total tally of nearly 14.3 million, India this week overtook Brazil to become the country with the second-highest number of cases worldwide after the United States.India’s daily coronavirus caseload has doubled in 10 days, as authorities grapple with shortages of vaccines, treatments and hospital beds.The Indian government said on Friday it will supply 17,092 MT of medical oxygen in a dozen states where the virus is surging, including Maharashtra and capital city of Delhi.Prime Minister Narendra Modi asked state to source medical oxygen from industrial plants, as supplies across the country have fallen short of meeting a demand surge due to a record-increase in COVID-19 infections.Having let its guard down with mass religious festivals, political rallies and crowds at cricket matches, India is experiencing a vicious second wave, recording almost two million fresh infections this month alone and forcing new restrictions in Mumbai, New Delhi and other cities.Experts have raised concerns about the spread of more contagious and deadlier variants of the disease, particularly given widespread participation in religious festivals and political rallies.A Lancet study this month estimated that India’s fatalities could double by June.“The biggest fight we have is in the society … Over a period of time, people have adopted a casual approach,” Health Minister Harsh Vardhan said at New Delhi’s All India Institute of Medical Sciences on Friday.Several senior leaders and opposition lawmakers, including Modi and Congress’s Rahul Gandhi, have been holding large rallies for supporters amid elections in five regions, including West Bengal.Visuals from the rallies have shown thousands of mask-less people crowded together and chanting slogans as they listen to speeches from politicians, in clear violation of social distancing and other COVID-19 norms.Home Minister Amit Shah was scheduled to hold public meetings and roadshows in West Bengal on Friday.Meanwhile, hundreds of people at a religious gathering in Haridwar in the north of the country tested positive for COVID-19 as tens of thousands of devout pilgrims jostled to take a holy dip in the Ganges.The weeks-long Kumbh Mela festival, where ascetics bathe to wash away their sins, began earlier this month and officials have warned they expect cases to rise significantly. One local official called it a “super-spreader” event.There are also growing calls for officials to speed up the country’s vaccination programme as hospitals are swamped with patients.India has so far injected 115 million vaccine doses, the highest globally after the US and China, but that covers only a small fraction of its 1.4 billion people.In the heat of the latest wave of infections, India has shifted from being a mass vaccine exporter to a major importer.Officials abruptly changed the rules to allow vaccine imports to be fast-tracked, having earlier rebuffed foreign drugmakers like Pfizer. It will import Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine starting this month to cover as many as 125 million people.India is also seeking to inoculate more of its population using domestically produced shots.India on Thursday gave approval to the Haffkine Institute in the western Maharashtra state to begin producing Bharat Biotech’s COVAXIN shot, a move that is expected to help ease supply bottlenecks.The country is currently administering COVAXIN and AstraZeneca’s vaccine, which is manufactured by the Serum Institute of India and branded as Covishield.Indian hospitals are now struggling to cope, running short of beds, oxygen and coronavirus medicines like remdesivir.In a new disturbing trend, doctors across the most-affected cities told AFP news agency they had seen an increase in the number of COVID-19 patients aged below 45 and suffering from more severe symptoms compared with last year.“We are also seeing children under the ages of 12 and 15 being admitted with symptoms in the second wave. Last year there were practically no children presenting symptoms,” said Khusrav Bajan, a consultant at Mumbai’s PD Hinduja National Hospital.Many crematoriums are also struggling, according to press reports.“Since 9am, we have been waiting outside.

242,India to give adults free COVID shots after surge in infections,"India will provide free COVID-19 vaccines to all adults, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said, in an effort to rein in a pandemic that has killed hundreds of thousands of people and led to the world’s second-highest tally of infections.Modi’s announcement came on Monday after weeks of criticism of a bungled vaccine rollout that has covered fewer than 5 percent of India’s estimated adult population of 950 million.Health experts have warned that vaccination is the only way to protect lives from a feared third wave of infections after a surge in April-May overwhelmed hospitals in the big cities and in the vast hinterland.India is the second worst-hit nation after the United States with just below 29 million confirmed COVID-19 infections.Modi said the federal government would take over the vaccination programme from the states from June 21, reversing a policy under which states were partially running it.“Whether it is the poor, the lower middle class, the middle class, or the upper middle class, under the federal government programme, everyone will get free vaccines,” he said on national television.Under the earlier policy, the federal government gave free vaccines to the elderly and front-line workers, and left state governments and private hospitals to administer doses for a fee to people in the 18-45 age group.State governments were also competing against each other to procure vaccines from local manufacturers as well as foreign firms.Grappling with acute shortages, several states imposed strict curbs, including wholesale lockdowns, in recent weeks.Several vaccination centres also shut down within days of the widening of the campaign to include everyone above the age of 18.“We will increase the speed of procuring vaccines and also increase the pace of the vaccination programme,” Modi said.Last week, the government said it could have as many as 10 million doses each day in July and August, up from just below three million now.Some hospitals said a uniform policy to distribute vaccines could ease the burden of procurement and prices.“The centre would have a lot more clout in dealing with the multinationals … rather than individual states or smaller players directly negotiating with these companies,” Sudarshan Ballal, chairman at Manipal Hospitals, told Reuters news agency.India has been inoculating its people with the AstraZeneca vaccine produced locally by the Serum Institute of India and Covaxin made by local firm Bharat Biotech. It will commercially launch Russia’s Sputnik V shots this month.Modi said the government would allow private hospitals to have 25 percent of all vaccine supplies but not to charge more than 150 rupees ($2) over the cost of the dose.The new policy should help move things faster, an expert said.“This [centralised inoculation policy] eliminates states having to compete with one another for vaccine supplies, leaving them to concentrate on distributing them rapidly to their populations,” Gautam Menon, professor of physics and biology at Ashoka University in New Delhi, said.Overnight, India reported 100,636 new infections, the lowest in the world’s second-most populous nation since April 6, and well off last month’s peaks of more than 400,000, allowing authorities to reopen the economy partially.The financial hub of Mumbai and the national capital territory Delhi allowed private businesses to bring back 50 percent of their staff to workplaces and partially resumed public transport.Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal also announced that city officials would conduct door-to-door visits to enrol those aged above 45 for vaccination.Experts warn that while the crisis has eased in Delhi, Mumbai and other big cities, the disease is still spreading in rural areas and in some southern and northeastern states.The death toll – which usually lags infection figures by several weeks – was still at elevated levels, they added.“Currently, the states with high test-positivity rates like Kerala and Tamil Nadu need to maintain the restrictions as any major easing can be risky,” community health expert Rajib Dasgupta told the AFP news agency.",Covaxin,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/6/7/india-to-give-adults-free-covid-shots-after-surge-in-infections,AL JAZEERA,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""source"", ""reason"": ""The article relies heavily on government sources and experts who support the new vaccination policy, while not providing counter-sources or perspectives that might question its effectiveness."", ""confidence"": 0.8}",no ,source,no source bias

Both were highest-ever single-day tallies.As soon as the SII announced its prices, a senior politician and former federal minister belonging to the main opposition Congress party criticised the government, saying the different prices for states “will bleed dry the already reeling state finances”.“We demand one nation, one price for centre and state government,” Jairam Ramesh tweeted on Wednesday.Central Govt will continue to pay Rs 150 per dose for Covishield.

Middlemen brought in without price controls. No vaccine guarantee for weaker sections. GOI’s Vaccine Discrimination – Not Distribution – Strategy!” Gandhi tweeted on Tuesday.Health experts have also expressed concern over whether millions of India’s poor will be able to get themselves vaccinated.“Every person, particularly low-income families, should be covered … They should not be deprived of the chance to get vaccination because people from high-income families can go and purchase from the market. It’s absolutely important that no person is deprived of the chance to get the vaccine only on the grounds of affordability,” K Srinath, president of the Public Health Foundation of India, told Al Jazeera.India kicked off its inoculation drive in mid-January and has administered more than 127 million shots so far.Some local authorities have however been running short of supplies, and India has put the brakes on exports of the AstraZeneca shot.“At the moment, there is not enough vaccine to meet the current requirement. Although the government of India has indicated that from May 1 they can vaccinate [all above the age of 18], to my thinking it will take some more time because those [vaccine] arrangements have to be made first,” Lalit Kant, former head of the department of epidemiology at the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), told Al Jazeera.Meanwhile, India’s Bharat Biotech said on Tuesday it is scaling up production of its homegrown Covaxin vaccine to 700 million doses per year.Covaxin is being administered alongside AstraZeneca’s shot in India, while approval has also been given for Russia’s Sputnik V.In a related development, Johnson & Johnson company on Tuesday said it is seeking to conduct a local clinical trial in India for its single-dose COVID-19 vaccine, which was paused in the United States last week on reports of rare blood clots.The company said it had submitted an application to India’s drug regulator – the Drugs Controller General of India – requesting approval for the “bridging” safety and immunogenicity study for its vaccine.The global rollout of the single-dose vaccine, which is seen as a vital weapon in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, received a jolt when US federal health agencies last Tuesday recommended pausing its use.J&J’s India application, which the company said was to comply with local regulations, comes as the country grapples with a second wave in COVID-19 cases that has severely strained its health system and caused shortages of oxygen and medicines.Last week, India said it would fast-track emergency approvals for foreign-made COVID-19 vaccines, a move that would exempt companies from carrying out “bridging” trials for their vaccines.Johnson & Johnson did not immediately give more details about the process.Bilal Kuchay contributed to this report from New Delhi, India",Covaxin,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/4/21/india-covid-vaccine-at-5-for-states-8-for-private-hospitals,AL JAZEERA,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""selection"", ""reason"": ""The article presents a balanced view by including quotes and opinions from various stakeholders, such as the Serum Institute of India, Jairam Ramesh, Rahul Gandhi, and health experts.

244,Families grapple as India’s health bodies change COVID guidelines,"New Delhi, India – Late last month, the Indian government made far-reaching changes to the COVID-19 treatment protocol for hospitals, leading to much debate and confusion after drugs people knew almost by rote were dropped.For months, I had read and reread my family’s prescriptions, remembering what to administer to whom, goading the local pharmacies to send it fast. Like thousands of others, I had also read hundreds of social media pleas for these drugs.So why did the government drop them? As I Googled and searched, I also remembered that ivermectin, one of the drugs now dropped and under much scrutiny, was first prescribed to me by my dermatologist in July last year.“Just one pill, tonight,’’ said the doctor. I was told it is an anti-parasitic drug, used for deworming and scabies.But little did I know that two months on, I would be prescribed ivermectin as part of my COVID treatment.During a telephone consultation, the doctor prescribed five days of doxycycline (anti-bacterial drug) and one day of ivermectin.Later that day, when government health workers made a compulsory call to our doorstep, my husband, who was COVID-19 negative, and I were given a pack of hydroxychloroquine and told to take the pill for seven days.Both of us skipped it.A popular drug at that time, its demand spiked after former US President Donald Trump threatened to stop medical supplies if India curtailed its export to the United States.This was still the first wave. While there were endless tragedies of Indian migrants walking home, people losing their livelihood and a massive economic slowdown triggered by the lockdown, death rates were low, and hospitals and oxygen were not in short supply.The second wave, which we all thought by most accounts would be weaker, was yet to ravage us.In April, the second wave hit our home. My whole family – my husband, my mother and my in-laws – got COVID-19, some despite being vaccinated. We were caught in the middle of the ferocious outbreak when hospital beds, oxygen and medicines were in short supply.My father-in-law who was COVID positive was given ivermectin for about a week. He was also given the ani-viral drug, favipiravir, more commonly known as fabiflu.By the time he reached the hospital on May 2 for lung pneumonia, he had already been given ivermectin, doxycycline, azithromycin and favipiravir. In hospital, they further administered remdesivir and plasma therapy – twice.We had worked the phone lines to get him a hospital bed and an oxygen concentrator. We did the same for my mother when she was admitted on May 11.The only difference: by the time she reached hospital for lung pneumonia, plasma therapy had been dropped from the government’s health protocol for the coronavirus.But this was April 2021. The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), the country’s top scientific body, had flagged the “inappropriate use of plasma therapy” way back in November 2020.In a news release on November 17, 2020, ICMR said “PLACID, the world’s largest plasma trial, had shown no benefit of CPT in patients”.On June 10 this year, Samiran Panda, head of the ICMR’s epidemiology and communicable diseases division, confirmed to me that plasma therapy has been flagged as showing no benefit by the ICMR.On other drugs such as ivermectin, he said all evidence was based on observational studies, which indicated that it might be helpful but there was “no double-blind placebo-controlled randomised clinical trial for its efficacy”.“Neither was evidence robust enough for the use of doxycycline, favipiravir and hydroxychloroquine,” he said.Many of these drugs were part of the health ministry’s clinical guidelines for COVID-19 until May 27. But they were not approved by the World Health Organization or the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of the US.However, many doctors believe plasma therapy did save lives.Dr Manoj Luthra, director of the department of cardiac surgery at Jaypee Hospital in Noida, a city outside New Delhi, told me that “while plasma therapy may have been struck off by the government, there is enough anecdotal evidence with doctors about its efficacy as a treatment method for COVID-19”.“Some of us have also written to the government on this,” he said, sharing an article titled Emerging Evidence Demonstrating the Efficacy of Ivermectin in Prophylaxis and Treatment of COVID-19, published in the American Journal of Therapeutics.But by April, concerns were widespread about other drugs such as the extensive use of steroids to treat coronavirus. Both my mother and my father-in-law were given steroids for more than a month.In May, we learned that the government’s new guidelines would advise hospitals to use steroids for no more than 10 days or until the time of hospitalisation, whichever was earlier.Steroids, which have been essential in reducing lung inflammation in COVID-19 patients, are considered life-saving if given to patients at the right time and for the right duration. But they also reduce immunity and elevate blood sugar levels.Bishnu Panigrahi, group head of medical strategies at Fortis, one of India’s largest private hospital groups, said “as far as steroids are concerned, they have been misused”.He said steroids were used “very early during the treatment, in higher doses and for prolonged periods, resulting in secondary infections”.“Black fungus is a fallout of inappropriate use of steroids,” he said.Black fungus, or mucormycosis, is a rare but life-threatening infection with a mortality rate of 50 percent. It affects the sinuses, brain and lungs and can be fatal in severely immunocompromised patients.In India, the disease has seen a 150 percent rise, with 31,216 infections and 2,109 deaths reported during the second wave so far.Black fungus has now been listed as an epidemic under the Epidemic Diseases Act by the Indian government.As worries rose about the overuse of prescribed drugs, the government made sweeping changes to the health protocol late last month.On May 27, the Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS), which comes under the health ministry, effectively dropped all drugs that the doctors had been routinely prescribing, including ivermectin, azithromycin, doxycycline, zinc, favipiravir and plasma therapy.The DGHS recommended only antipyretics (medication used to prevent or reduce fevers) and antitussives (to relieve or suppress coughing) for mild patients, and no medication or investigation for asymptomatic patients.Steroids and anticoagulants were advised for moderate cases, and immediate oxygen therapy, intubation, ventilation and immune-modulators were added for severe cases.The medical body retained remdesivir (for moderate to severe cases) and tocilizumab, an off-label immunosuppressant for severe to critically ill patients.The DGHS’s new guidelines were welcomed by many, including the WHO whose Chief Scientist Soumya Swaminathan tweeted: “Evidence-based guidelines from @mohfw DGHS – simple, rational and clear guidance for physicians.”Swaminathan said the guidelines “can be updated as and when new evidence becomes available”.However, guidelines issued by the health ministry and the ICMR continue to recommend both ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine for mild to moderate cases. They have not been updated or changed until the publication of this report.At present, COVID-19 guidelines are given out by the DGHS, federal health ministry, ICMR and state medical councils. And they are not always the same.So, while almost all common drugs in use so far against COVID-19 have been dropped, remdesivir, which is a broad-spectrum anti-viral drug used in Hepatitis C treatment, has been retained by the DGHS in its health protocol. The drug has also been approved by the FDA and is in use in several other countries to treat coronavirus.But like everything else, there is no broad consensus on it either.Panigrahi of Fortis Hospitals says there has been “rampant use of remdesivir, which is a result of big pharma pushing this drug aggressively, despite literature not showing any significant reduction in mortality”.However, DS Rana, medical superintendent at New Delhi’s Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, one of the largest COVID facilities in the capital, says it is an effective anti-viral drug.“Well-conducted trials showed that if this drug is used early in the viral phase, it can have a positive effect on early recovery from COVID in terms of hospitalisation. DGHS has recommended its judicious use,” he said.While no treatment mechanism can be perfect in the current scenario, and trial and error are part of fighting an unknown virus, evidence must be looked at repeatedly to modify treatment decisions to reduce the long-term effects of experimental drugs.By the government’s own admission, a third wave of the virus is “inevitable”.Experts say precedents and examples set in the US and Europe suggest that vaccination of at least 30-40 percent of the population by the end of the year can be an effective deterrent against the virus.So far, less than five percent of India’s 950 million adult population has been fully vaccinated.The country’s total COVID-19 caseload currently stands at nearly 30 million, while 381,903 deaths were recorded until Thursday. Close to 200,000 deaths took place during the second COVID wave.Therefore, concerns are growing over reinfections, rehospitalisations and secondary infections even though the daily caseload has fallen substantially in the last two weeks.Indians are hoping the government’s new centralised policy of vaccination, announced on June 7, should further ease the caseload.Under the new policy, effective from June 21, the federal government will directly procure 75 percent of the manufactured vaccine doses and administer them for free. The remaining 25 percent of shots will be available in private hospitals.While global trends show that transmission and death rates drop with increased vaccinations, the Indian government must streamline its clinical treatment protocols for COVID-19 and bring them in line with global trends.As for my family, my mother is still recovering from a secondary infection and my father-in-law continues to suffer from post-COVID complications.",Covaxin,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/6/17/families-grapple-as-indias-health-bodies-change-covid-guidelines,AL JAZEERA,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""omission"", ""reason"": ""The article presents a balanced view of the controversy surrounding COVID-19 treatment protocols in India, but omits to mention the government's response to criticism and potential biases in the selection of experts quot"", ""confidence"": 0.8}",yes,omission,omits to mention the government's response to criticism and potential biases in the selection of experts
245,India imposes retaliatory COVID restrictions on British nationals,"Fully vaccinated British nationals arriving in India will be subjected to a 10-day mandatory quarantine, in response to similar measures imposed on Indian nationals.The move comes after India’s Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla called Britain’s decision not to recognise the Indian version of the AstraZeneca vaccine, known as Covishield, “discriminatory”. He had warned of reciprocal measures should London fail to reconsider.Starting on Monday, all British arrivals – irrespective of their vaccination status – will have to present a negative COVID-19 test taken a maximum of 72 hours prior to departure, undergo a second test on arrival and a third eight days later.A mandatory quarantine period of 10 days will also be enforced, according to a foreign ministry official who spoke to The Associated Press news agency.The British government announced last month it would allow fully vaccinated travellers to skip quarantine and take fewer tests, but only recognised vaccination under the American, British or European programmes or those authorised by an approved health body.More than a dozen countries in Asia, the Caribbean and the Middle East made it to the list, but India’s programme was not included. Similarly, no programme in the African continent was accepted.The vast majority of Indians have been vaccinated with Indian-made AstraZeneca shots, which has been produced by Serum Institute of India. Others have received COVAXIN, a vaccine produced by an Indian company that is not used in Britain.India, the world’s largest vaccine producer, announced earlier this week that it would resume donations of surplus coronavirus vaccines after it froze exports due to a surge in domestic infections.Britain’s refusal to accept certain vaccine certificates has led to concerns that it could exacerbate vaccine hesitancy.Countries that received hundreds of thousands of doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine from the British government were left wondering why their vaccination programmes were not good enough in the eyes of its provider.Britain is one of the worst performers in the COVAX programme, through which industrialised countries reallocate vaccines to poorer countries.Rob Yates, director of the global health programme at the Chatham House think-tank in London, told AP that Britain’s policy was “indicative of the lack of solidarity that has been shown by governments and by politicians″.“It’s unfortunate that we’re seeing tit-for-tat. In terms of humanity and for us all this is what we want to be avoiding,” Yates said.” We want much more cooperation.″",Covaxin,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/10/1/india-to-impose-retaliatory-covid-19-restrictions-on-britons,AL JAZEERA,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""source"", ""reason"": ""The article relies heavily on a British think-tank (Chatham House) and quotes a director from London, while not providing any Indian perspectives or sources."", ""confidence"": 0.8}",yes,source,"relies heavily on a British think-tank (Chatham House) and quotes a director from London, while not providing any Indian perspectives or sources"
246,‘Much safer now’: Is India past the worst of COVID pandemic?,"New Delhi, India – On Tuesday, India reported 7,579 coronavirus cases – the lowest rise in 543 days, despite huge festival gatherings in recent weeks.“Even after [Hindu festival of] Diwali, we are not seeing a surge,” Dr M D Gupte, former director of National Institute of Epidemiology, was quoted as saying in media reports, attributing it mainly to the presence of antibodies in a huge majority of Indians through natural infection.“I think we are much safer now,” Gupte said.According to government surveys, nearly 70 percent of Indians were naturally infected by July, following a record rise in infections and deaths during a brutal second wave in April and May.In a statement last week, the health ministry said active cases account for less than one percent of the total, the lowest since March 2020.Even as India emerges from its festive season and is currently gripped by raging air pollution and falling temperatures – conditions presumed to be optimal for a surge in coronavirus infections – the country seems to have dodged another deadly wave.For the past 21 weeks, India has logged less than 50,000 cases a day. Since the second week of October, it has remained below 20,000 – a far cry from the deadly second wave in April and May this year with more than 400,000 daily cases at its peak.The government and health experts feared a third wave of the virus, with media reports in August and September warning of the wave peaking in October or November.One of those reports quoted the National Institute of Disaster Management (NIDM), under India’s Ministry of Home Affairs, warning of a third wave in October. The report, published in mid-August and submitted to the Prime Minister’s Office, cited government experts and institutions warning of an imminent wave.Among those cited in the report was K VijayRaghavan, the principal scientific adviser to the government, who during a May 2021 press briefing, said the third COVID-19 wave was “inevitable” and that children would be at a greater risk.The report highlighted possible scenarios predicted by the Indian Institute of Technology – Kanpur, one of India’s premier state-run institutions, whose study anticipated more than 300,000 coronavirus cases a day – lower than the second wave peaks – in October if there were no restrictions in place.With strict interventions, a peak of more than 200,000 a day was anticipated in late October.However, with no such surge in sight, experts are now talking about a scenario where the disease might have entered an “endemic phase” in India.“We need to understand that the disease is nowhere near being eliminated. It is present and continues to spread. It is endemic only when it does not take on the proportions of a pandemic,” says T Sundararaman, the global coordinator of the People’s Health Movement and a former executive director of the National Health Systems Resource Centre.For that to happen, Sundararaman explains, COVID-19’s R0 value should remain below 1. In epidemiology, R0 or R-naught is the average number of people that a single infected person can transmit the disease. In short, it indicates how contagious an infectious disease is.Some recent studies have put this number for the Delta variant, the coronavirus responsible for the second wave in India, between 5 to 8 – meaning it is as infectious as, say, chickenpox.“It will be a low level of transmission which might persist quite indefinitely, like the way we have flu or typhoid persisting. In an endemic, there is no endpoint,” said Sundararaman, describing what an endemic COVID-19 scenario could look like.In February this year, a Nature journal survey found an overwhelming majority – almost 90 percent – of scientists “felt that SARS-CoV-2 was either very likely or likely to become an endemic virus”. Months later, scientists in India at least are anticipating the same.“The Himalayan magnitude of the second wave made us reach what epidemiologists call ‘herd immunity threshold’ at which point epidemic has to yield to ‘endemic’ phase with low and steady numbers,” renowned virologist and retired professor Dr T Jacob John, who claims that India is the first country to reach endemic phase, told Al Jazeera.While some are convinced of COVID-19’s endemicity, others remain cautious.“I am cautious of saying that India has reached endemicity because one bad variant emerging anywhere can alter this balance,” Shahid Jameel, an eminent virologist and a research fellow at the Green Templeton College, University of Oxford, told Al Jazeera.Earlier this month, fear of another lockdown was rumoured as the southern state of Karnataka reported seven cases of the new Delta Plus variant, AY.4.2, a sub-lineage of the Delta variant.According to news reports, about 40 cases of AY.4.2 were reported in at least six states.Later, the Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomics Consortium (INSACOG) said the frequency of AY.4.2 is too low (less than 0.1 percent of all variants of concern and interest) in India.Delta lineages are said to be driving the third wave in the United Kingdom. The sub-lineage AY.4.2, speculated to be 10-15 percent more transmissible than Delta, is tearing through Europe, triggering restrictions amid rising case rates and hospital admissions.The variant’s prevalence in the UK, according to the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), has increased to nearly 13 percent of the Delta cases. Delta Plus, which was first detected in July, was declared a “variant under investigation” by the UKHSA last month.“Clinical cases in western countries are now among the non-immune (mostly unvaccinated). That means the population immunity (or herd immunity) due to past infections remains low, like a debt they owe to Delta variant,” said Jacob John.UKHSA data suggest that the ongoing surge is driven by the younger, unvaccinated group. Jameel placed the blame on “poor compliance” and “opening up” of the country where infections are driven by school-going children and teenagers.“But severe disease and mortality are very low. This is due to high adult vaccination rates and naturally mild infections in younger people,” Jameel said.According to virologist Jacob John, Delta had a relatively free run in India. And with two-dose vaccinations slowly climbing up, it has added to very high herd immunity due to the enormous second wave.Last month, Mumbai, one of India’s worst-hit cities, reported no deaths for the first time since the beginning of the pandemic. New Delhi has already seen several zero-death days in the past few months. The two cities, worst-hit by the second wave, have found high seropositivity (an indication of infections) in their population.“We found that 90 percent of the vaccinated people had antibodies and among the unvaccinated, we found antibodies in around 79 percent of them,” said Dr Daksha Shah, the deputy executive health officer with the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC).Shah points to the last serosurvey conducted by the BMC, released in September, which found that 86 percent of the residents in Mumbai had antibodies against coronavirus.“The whole economy has opened up, from trains, buses to even theatres have opened. Most of the restrictions have been eased out. Even then the cases are not increasing. And of course, there is an effect of vaccinations,” said Shah.New Delhi’s recent serosurvey – its sixth – reported more than 95 percent of seropositivity in the samples from each of its districts either due to vaccination or past infection. The national capital has consistently reported few fresh cases and deaths despite the lifting of all restrictions.In eastern India, Kolkata observed a spurt in daily cases after the Hindu festival of Durga Puja.“Cases are falling, official figures show that and in hospitals, we can see vacant beds again. There was a surge in cases after Pujo but never became a raging wave like the second wave,” Kolkata-based Dr Arjun Dasgupta, who is the president of West Bengal Doctors Forum, told Al Jazeera.“Immunity attained in exchange for millions of deaths and the first dose of vaccinations together may have done the trick.”The Indian government celebrated a considerable milestone of administering one billion COVID-19 vaccine doses on October 21, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi commemorating it with an address to the nation. This month, the government complimented itself for vaccinating nearly 81 percent of the eligible adult population with the first dose.Despite early celebrations, only about 40 percent of the population is estimated to be fully vaccinated and millions are skipping their second doses. Government data shows that more than 120 million people did not turn up for their second dose.India has reported a total of 34.5 million COVID-19 cases, second only to the United States. Deaths rose by 236 in the past 24 hours to 466,147.Meanwhile, India’s reliance on digital solutions for its mega vaccination plan has been criticised for being exclusionary and limiting in approach.On November 2, in an attempt to ramp up vaccinations and vaccinate those due for second doses, the Indian government launched a month-long door-to-door campaign, called “Har Ghar Dastak” (Knocking at Each Door).“Vaccine hesitancy is a serious problem. You can’t do it with OTPs [one-time passwords] and apps. They [people] need to be traced, from house to house. We have an army of people who have done wonders.

Deaths swelled by 188, the highest figure in two months, to stand at 159,044.India has the world’s highest tally of infections after the United States and Brazil.Nearly 62 percent of infections in the past 24 hours and 46 percent of the deaths were reported in the western state of Maharashtra, the country’s worst affected.The federal government has blamed crowding and a general reluctance to wear masks for the spike, ruling out the virus mutations that have been a factor in Western countries.Maharashtra, home to India’s commercial capital of Mumbai, is among the states that have already tightened rules to curb the spread of the virus.Prime Minister Narendra Modi will discuss the rise in cases in a video conference with state chief ministers later on Wednesday.",Covaxin,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/3/17/india-reports-highest-daily-rise-in-covid-cases-in-three-months,AL JAZEERA,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""source"", ""reason"": ""The article relies on the 'health ministry' as a source without mentioning any counter-sources or alternative views."", ""confidence"": 0.8}",no,none,no source bias
248,India sees worst single-day rise in COVID cases since December 24,"India has registered its worst single-day increase in coronavirus cases since late December as the western state of Maharashtra battles a resurgence.India’s health ministry on Friday reported 23,285 new cases of COVID-19 in the past 24 hours. It is the highest daily rise since December 24, according to government data.India has so far reported more than 11.3 million cases of coronavirus infection, the world’s second-highest total after the United States, and 158,000 deaths.The cases had been falling steadily since a peak in late September, but experts say increased public gatherings and laxity toward public health guidance is leading to the latest surge.The increase in new cases is being reported in six states, including Maharashtra, where authorities have announced a lockdown in densely populated Nagpur city.A weeklong complete lockdown will be implemented next week, officials said. The vaccine drive will, however, continue in the city.In Thane district, adjacent to Mumbai, a lockdown has been declared at 16 hotspots until March 31 with only essential services to remain open.Restrictions on opening of markets, movement and closure of schools and colleges and night curfews have been announced in five other districts of Maharashtra.Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray’s party has warned that unless people kept to the rules, more restrictions such as a statewide lockdown would be inevitable.Government health official Vinod Kumar Paul in a news conference on Thursday said the latest surge, particularly in Maharashtra, was worrying. He advised people not to lower their guard as “the pandemic is not yet over”.India began its vaccination drive in January and has advanced to the second phase, giving shots to healthcare workers, people older than 60 and people over 45 with significant health risks.But the programme aiming to vaccinate 300 million people by August is running way below capacity. More than 26 million people have received a shot, though only 4.72 million are fully vaccinated with both doses.The pace of vaccination has prompted concerns India could miss its targets.The effort is fraught with logistical challenges in a country with nearly 1.4 billion people, but the drive has added urgency since new infections have begun to increase again after months of consistent decline.",Covaxin,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/3/12/india-sees-worst-single-day-rise-in-covid-cases-since-december-24,AL JAZEERA,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""tonality"", ""reason"": ""The article's tone is critical of India's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, using words like 'worst single-day rise', 'resurgence', and 'worrying'.

249,Oxygen shortage in India’s Maharashtra as COVID cases soar,"When COVID-19 struck Karamsingh Pawar, a tribal activist from Nandurbar district in northwestern Maharashtra, it took him 48 hours to get a hospital bed with oxygen support.After the 55-year-old was admitted into the government-run COVID-19 centre, he had to spend half a day in the corridor before being shifted to a bed on April 11.By then, his oxygen saturation was dangerously low and he succumbed the next day. “He was severely breathless by the time he was put on oxygen support,” Pawar’s son-in-law Prabhakar Thakare told Al Jazeera over the phone.As Maharashtra, India’s richest state, grapples with ferociously rising COVID-19 cases, patients such as Pawar are struggling to find hospital beds and oxygen support. The state’s daily oxygen usage has touched 1,500 metric tonnes, according to Health Minister Rajesh Tope.This is much more than its daily production of 1,250 tonnes. While other states are contributing to plug the shortfall, transportation by road takes time. Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray has now requested Prime Minister Narendra Modi to deploy the National Disaster Management Authority to airlift oxygen for rapid movement.Nandurbar, 450km (220 miles) away from financial capital Mumbai, is a tribal-dominated and acute malnutrition-hit district with poor healthcare infrastructure and difficult hilly terrain. As the virus spreads rapidly in such remote areas, Maharashtra stares at a greater challenge in arresting the continuing second wave of the pandemic.“In the first wave, our active cases hovered around 300 to 500,” said Dr Nitin Bodke, district health officer of Nandurbar. “This time, the active cases have shot up to 10,000.”The district currently has about 1,000 hospital beds for COVID-19 patients, including 400 with oxygen and intensive care support. To tackle the shortage, the district is set to open a 21-coach train modified into an isolation centre for victims.The train will add 336 beds to the pool. Last year, more than 300 coaches were modified by Indian Railways and kept on standby. “Nandurbar was the first district to requisition the coaches,” said Sumit Thakur, chief public relations officer of Western Railway.Maharashtra has recorded more than 3.7 million cases and 59,550 fatalities so far. It currently accounts for 40 percent of India’s total active cases. On Friday, the state reported 63,729 new infections. The highest surge has been recorded in Mumbai.Other parts of eastern and western Maharashtra are also recording a high number of infections leaving patients to traverse hundreds of kilometres from one district to another in search of oxygen-capable hospital beds.In Nanded district, a drought-prone region in southeastern Maharashtra, an 85-year-old had to travel 400km (250 miles) in an ambulance till she found an oxygen bed. Shalini Wadalkar succumbed on April 13, three days after hospitalisation.“We went to four hospitals in Nanded, including one government hospital but none of them had an oxygen bed,” said Wadalkar’s nephew Vishal Dahale. From Nanded, they drove her to the neighbouring Yavatmal district about 200km (90 miles) away.None of the hospitals had a vacant bed there, either. By then, they got a call from a private hospital in Nanded about a bed vacancy and immediately rushed back. “I had never been through so much mental agony. I can’t even imagine what my aunt was going through,” said Dahale.Experts say reducing the number of infections is the only way to salvage Maharashtra’s grim situation. On April 14, the state announced new restrictions until May 1. All establishments, public places and activities were shut down, barring essential services. Public transport was allowed to function.“I certainly hope that these fresh sets of restrictions will break the chain of infection,” said Dr Om Shrivastav, an infectious disease specialist in a private hospital in Mumbai and member of Maharashtra’s COVID-19 taskforce.In Mumbai, where the daily cases are now averaging 9,300, the civic body has implemented innovative ways to improve bed availability. Two five-star hotels were designated as “step-down” facilities for patients who no longer need emergency medical care and are on their way to recovery. More hotels will be requisitioned in the coming days for the transfer of patients.In the continuing second wave, Mumbai has seen a jump in infections among the upper middle-class population. Owing to this trend, the demand for private hospital beds has risen. The shortfall of beds, mainly oxygen and intensive care unit ones, is also arising from the private sector.On Saturday, 98 percent of Mumbai’s 2,711 ICU beds were occupied. In a rare step, the city’s Commissioner Iqbal Chahal ordered a private hospital to allot more than 75 percent of its beds for COVID-19 patients, and more may be asked to follow suit.Maharashtra remains the top state in terms of vaccination with more than 10 million doses administered so far. But it hit a major roadblock recently with a shortage of both vaccines it is offering – India’s homegrown Covaxin by Bharat Biotech and AstraZeneca’s Covishield, which are being mass-produced by the Serum Institute of India.Even as the vaccination drive has now resumed, health experts say the numbers are just a drop in the ocean for a state with a population of more than 120 million.“India’s vaccination rate is overall low as compared to other countries, considering the large population,” said Soumitra Ghosh, assistant professor at the Centre for Health Policy, Planning and Management, Tata Institute of Social Sciences, Mumbai.India has administered 119 million doses to date. In comparison, the United States has given about 200 million jabs. China has reportedly administered some 184 million shots.“For large states like Maharashtra, the vaccination drive will need much more strengthening,” said Ghosh. “Not just vaccination, we also need to put the focus back on strict containment, isolation, testing and tracking of contacts. With the system overwhelmed with numbers, we currently lack this focus.”",Covaxin,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/4/17/india-maharashtra-grapples-with-oxygen-shortage-as-covid-cases,AL JAZEERA,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""omission"", ""reason"": ""The article does not mention the government's response to the crisis in a balanced manner.

250,What are the global implications of India’s second COVID wave?,"India has reported 357,229 new coronavirus cases over the last 24 hours – the 13th straight day of more than 300,000 infections – taking its overall tally to more than 20 million. Deaths rose 3,449 for a toll of 222,408, health ministry data showed on Tuesday.However, medical experts say the real numbers across the country of 1.35 billion may be five to 10 times higher than the official tally.The steep climb in infections in the first week of April, when for the first time India surged past 100,000 cases, was indicative of an impending disaster.In a matter of weeks, India descended into a COVID-19 hell as visuals of dead bodies lined up outside crematoriums, unending funeral pyres and burials emerged from its major cities and towns.The ongoing healthcare crisis is rapidly moving to smaller towns and villages where people are dying for lack of oxygen, hospital beds and lifesaving drugs, just like in the big cities.The second wave is largely attributed to a contagious mix of coronavirus variants spreading in different parts. Two variants, the UK variant (B1.1.7) and the Indian variant (B.1.617), are largely blamed for the current spate of infections.As evident from the mayhem caused by the UK variant in India, the emergence of an Indian variant sent ripples of concern across the globe.The Indian variant, which is suspected to be highly infectious, could snowball into a global problem – according to the WHO, it has already spread to at least 17 countries.“No place is really safe and that is why the world is so concerned,” says India’s leading virologist, Shahid Jameel.The disastrous new chapter of the pandemic in India threatens not just its safety but puts the entire world at risk.Since December last year, several variants have been spreading across the country.In the northern states, the UK variant is seen to be more dominant according to experts, with nearly 80 percent of the spread in Punjab and 40 to 50 percent of the spread in Haryana and Delhi is attributed to it.It is also present in Uttar Pradesh and Indian-administered Kashmir, in different proportions.In Maharashtra, however, the Indian variant is more virulent, with some parts of the state reporting as much as 60 percent of the sample being the Indian variant.In the east, a different story unfolds.“Our analysis shows that every possible variant is in West Bengal,” says Jameel.A long-drawn assembly election in West Bengal, with mega election rallies led by political leaders including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, is believed to have turned into multiple “super-spreader” events.While the state witnesses a spike in cases, the true scale of the spread in West Bengal will be visible in the weeks to come, say experts.According to Jameel, West Bengal has the UK and the Indian strains as well as the South African variant (B.1.351) in small proportions.“Vaccines have less effect on this (South African) variant and how it came into Bengal remains a mystery,” says Jameel, adding that the strain is also circulating in Bangladesh.The state also discovered another variant, B.1.618, a new lineage of the Indian variant with a mutation characteristic of the highly transmissible South African and Brazilian (P.1) variants.The WHO lists three variants, first found in the UK, South Africa and Brazil, as “variants of concern” while the Indian variant remains a “variant of interest”.Some, however, caution about putting the blame solely on variants and ignoring the lack of public health measures that lead to the surge.“India opened early, thinking the virus was under control, and recent ‘mask-less’ political rallies, outdoor religious festivals also played a major role in increasing transmission and spread,” said Pooja Gala of the NYU Department of Medicine and Department of Population Health.Despite a raging pandemic, the Indian government allowed religious gatherings like the Kumbh Mela (Pitcher Festival) which saw more than 9 million Hindu pilgrims converging in northern India’s Uttarakhand state.In a larger pool of infections, the likelihood of mutations increases.“Each time a wave or a spread occurs, the main strain that is spreading will keep changing,” says T Sundararaman, global coordinator of the People’s Health Movement and a former executive director of the National Health Systems Resource Centre.“But so far, none of the variants have shown the capacity of immune escape,” he says. Immune escape is when a human body fails to respond to an infectious agent, in this case, a variant.In a new study, researchers found that the more transmissible Brazilian variant was able to escape the body’s immune response built by a previous infection from a different variant.The Brazilian variant has spread across Latin America, causing deaths and hospitalisation even in countries with high vaccination rates.Similarly, in February, South Africa halted the rollout of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine (Covishield in India) after a trial showed that it offered “minimal protection” against mild and moderate cases of the South African variant.Sundararaman told Al Jazeera that if the spread continues in India, “variants of deadly potential which have immune escape properties” can spread and cause further waves in different countries despite high immunisation rates.“If we do not eliminate it, the pandemic can be a recurrent affair across the world for a long time,” says Sundararaman.According to Jameel, the incubation period (time between infection and symptoms) of the coronavirus is about two to three days or sometimes even longer.“The world is really shrunk now because of the speed of international travel. Any virus present anywhere can go to the other even before you get sick,” said Jameel.On April 20, Hong Kong shut down all flights from India for two weeks after the health officials found 58 passengers on a flight tested positive after arrival. Health officials found seven of them infected with the Indian variant but with N501Y mutation.The N501Y mutation, associated with higher transmissibility and lethality, had been found in three “variants of concern” – the UK, South African and Brazilian – but not detected in the Indian variant earlier.Many, like American public health researcher Devi Sridhar, advocate border restrictions, managed quarantines, and vaccine passports that would enable fully vaccinated individuals quarantine-free travel.Border restrictions, she wrote in The Guardian, cannot stop new variants but can slow the spread to give scientists time to determine the risk level posed by the variants on the population of the country.Border restrictions have worked for several countries, such as New Zealand, Taiwan, South Korea and Singapore, helping them contain the spread and emergence of any variant.Vietnam, which shut down its borders in March last year, managed to limit the death toll to 35 and grow its economy.A global pandemic is everyone’s problem and requires a global response.“If we really want the pandemic to be over, we not only have to vaccinate at home but vaccinate everywhere. This is the only way to prevent the emergence of variants that could escape our immunity, or affect children more severely,” Sridhar wrote.Unlike the first wave last year, hospitals are witnessing more young adults and children being brought to the emergency.Earlier this month, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal revealed that more young people were getting infected, saying that “more than 65 per cent of the patients are below 45 years of age”.“We saw the same with B1.1.7 in the UK. This may be driven by variants that transmit more easily and cause more severe disease in all individuals, but we will need more data,” said Gala.Experts, especially in Western countries, are concerned about such a variant reaching their shores where, despite high immunisation in the older generations, the younger population remains at risk as they await their turn for vaccines.India, which was supposed to help vaccinate other countries, now struggles to vaccinate its own.Early this year, India launched an ambitious vaccination plan starting with the inoculation of 300 million Indians by summer. The country also sent more than 60 million doses of the Covishield and the domestically developed Covaxin vaccines to several countries as well.On May 1, India opened up vaccination for everyone between the age of 18 to 45 but struggles to supply the doses required to meet the demand. Several states have come out to say that they are forced to defer the vaccination drive because they lack the shots.“India was going to supply 50 percent of the world’s vaccines this summer and a lot of it were going to go to low and middle-income countries. Now the vaccines will be for domestic use,” says Jameel. This raises concern over the global demand for vaccines, especially in lower-income countries, that India was supposed to meet.With India reaching out to the world, many countries have rallied to help the crisis-hit country.India has received oxygen from Germany, Taiwan, the UK and several countries in the Middle East, among others. On May 1, it received the first consignment of Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine, which was granted emergency use approval by Indian regulators two weeks ago.The United States, after much pressure, will ease its embargo of raw materials for vaccines and send testing kits, protective gear, oxygen cylinders and ventilators.Experts suggest that help with supplies might not be enough and the situation would require waiving vaccines patents, transfer of technology, technical expertise and on-the-ground manpower for mass vaccination.",Covaxin,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/5/4/what-are-the-global-implications-of-indias-second-covid-wave,AL JAZEERA,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""framing"", ""reason"": ""The article frames the COVID-19 situation in India as a global problem and threat to international health, while also highlighting the Indian government's handling of the crisis.

251,"India’s lowest COVID spike in weeks, South Asia records 30m cases","India has reported 186,364 new coronavirus infections during the previous 24 hours, its lowest daily rise since April 14, as total cases in the South Asia region surpass 30 million, according to a Reuters news agency tally of official data.In India, COVID-related deaths rose by 3,660 in a day, with the country’s tally of infections now standing at 27.56 million and the death toll at 318,895, health ministry data showed on Friday.India’s official tally of daily coronavirus infections has been falling in the past few days, offering hope that its second wave is ebbing. But there are serious concerns that many new infections are not being reported, largely due to a dearth of testing in the countryside.The surge in South Asia is led by India which is struggling with a ferocious second COVID-19 wave and a severe shortage of vaccines.The world’s second-most populous country this month recorded its highest COVID-19 death toll since the pandemic began last year, accounting for just over a third of the overall total.The South Asia region – India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Bhutan, Nepal, Maldives and Sri Lanka – accounts for 18 percent of global cases and almost 10 percent of deaths.But there is ongoing suspicion that official tallies of infections and deaths are not reflecting the true extent of the problem.This month, India opened its coronavirus vaccination campaign to everyone aged 18 or older. However, it has not been able to meet vaccine demand despite being one of the biggest vaccine producers in the world.India has been inoculating its people with the AstraZeneca vaccine produced locally at the Serum Institute of India (SII), Covaxin made by local firm Bharat Biotech and has begun rolling out Russia’s Sputnik V.Prime Minister Narendra Modi has faced mounting criticism for the failure to secure vaccines as only about 3 percent of India’s 1.3 billion population has been fully vaccinated, the lowest rate among the 10 countries with the most cases.To meet domestic demand, India temporarily halted vaccine exports in March after donating or selling more than 66 million doses. The halt has left countries including Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and many in Africa scrambling for alternate supplies.However, India is still facing a vaccine shortage and several of its state governments, and even cities such as Mumbai, have launched global tenders or sought expressions of interest from firms such as Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson and Johnson for urgent supplies.Since India is unlikely to resume major exports of COVID-19 vaccines until October, other South Asian countries such as Nepal and Bangladesh are making diplomatic efforts to secure vaccines to prop up their faltering inoculation drives as their stocks run out.India’s western neighbour Pakistan, with purchases and donations from China and allocations from the World Health Organization and the GAVI Vaccine Alliance, has now secured more than 18 million doses.On Wednesday, Pakistan opened registration for its vaccination campaign for everyone aged 19 or older.At least 219.17 million vaccine doses have been administered in South Asia by Friday, according to figures from Our World in Data.",Covaxin,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/5/28/indias-lowest-covid-spike-in-weeks-south-asia-records-30m-cases,AL JAZEERA,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""omission"", ""reason"": ""Lack of critical evaluation of India's vaccination efforts and policies, with a focus on the challenges faced by other South Asian countries."", ""confidence"": 0.8}",yes,omission,"Lack of critical evaluation of India's vaccination efforts and policies, with a focus on the challenges faced by other South Asian countries."
252,Indian capital lifts weekend curfew as Omicron wave slows,"India’s capital Delhi has lifted a weekend curfew and allowed restaurants and marketplaces to reopen following a sharp drop in new infections of COVID-19.Under new orders, however, the city will remain under night-time curfew, and schools will be closed, a top Delhi official said, as government data suggested India’s recent Omicron variant outbreak had slowed.Restaurants, bars and cinemas in Delhi will be allowed to operate with up to 50 percent capacity and the number of people at weddings will be restricted to 200.“In view of the decline in positive cases, it was decided to gradually ease restrictions while ensuring adherence to COVID Appropriate Behaviour,” Delhi’s lieutenant governor Anil Baijal, who represents the federal government, said.The number of new cases in Delhi fell to 4,291 on January 27 from a peak of 28,867 on January 13. More than 85 percent of COVID beds across the city’s hospitals were unoccupied, government data showed.“The hospitalisation is far, far lower compared to what we saw in the previous wave,” said Dr Desh Deepak, a senior physician with state-run Dr Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital in Delhi.“Most patients who have died had underlying conditions such as cancer or kidney disease and most were not fully vaccinated.”Last week, authorities eased some curbs, allowing private offices to be partially staffed but advised people to work from home as much as possible.The capital has been one of the worst-hit in the ongoing third wave led by the highly infectious Omicron variant of the coronavirus and the city government had imposed the curfew on January 4 and ordered schools and restaurants to close.India on Friday reported 251,209 new COVID-19 infections over the last 24 hours, taking the overall tally to 40.62 million, the health ministry said. Deaths increased by 627 and total fatalities were 492,327.Late on Thursday, the federal home ministry urged states to remain vigilant and said it was a concern that 407 districts across 34 states and Union Territories were reporting an infective rate of more than 10 percent, Home Secretary Ajay Bhalla told them in a letter.“In the last five to seven days, there is an early indication of COVID cases plateauing… but we need to observe and take precautions,” health ministry official Lav Agarwal told a news conference on Thursday.India was battered by a devastating COVID outbreak last year that saw 200,000 people killed in a matter of weeks, overwhelming hospitals and crematoriums.Since then, the country has administered more than 1.6 billion vaccine doses and expanded its inoculation drive to teenagers, while giving booster shots to vulnerable people and front-line workers.The current wave of the pandemic comes weeks before assembly elections in five states, including Uttar Pradesh, India’s most populous state and home to 220 million people.Election authorities have restricted public campaign rallies, normally teeming with huge crowds, over fears they could spread the virus.",Covaxin,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/1/28/india-capital-delhi-lifts-weekend-curfew-omicron-covid-wave,AL JAZEERA,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""omission"", ""reason"": ""No mention of Covaxin, a COVID-19 vaccine developed in India, despite the article discussing vaccination efforts and the Omicron variant."", ""confidence"": 0.8}",yes,omission,"No mention of Covaxin, a COVID-19 vaccine developed in India, despite the article discussing vaccination efforts and the Omicron variant."
253,India COVID cases above 24 million as mutant spreads across globe,"The number of recorded COVID-19 infections in India has climbed above 24 million amid reports on Friday that the highly transmissible coronavirus mutant first detected in the country was spreading across the globe.The B.1.617 variant of the virus, first identified in India, has been found in cases in eight countries of the Americas, including Canada and the United States, Jairo Mendez, a World Health Organization (WHO) infectious diseases expert said on Friday.People infected by the variant included travellers in Panama and Argentina who had arrived from India or Europe. In the Caribbean, cases of the Indian variant have been detected in Aruba, Dutch Sint Maarten and the French department of Guadeloupe.The mutant strain has also been detected in Britain, as well as in Singapore.“These variants have a greater capacity for transmission but so far we have not found any collateral consequences,” Mendez said. “The only worry is that they spread faster.”Public Health England said the total number of confirmed cases of the variant had more than doubled in the past week to 1,313 across the United Kingdom.“We are anxious about it – it has been spreading,” British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said, adding that there would be meetings to discuss what to do. “We’re ruling nothing out,” he added.According to health ministry data, India recorded 4,000 deaths and 343,144 infections in the last 24 hours. It was the third consecutive day of 4,000 or more deaths but daily infections have stayed below a peak of 414,188 last week.While the total number of recorded infections crossed 24 million, the number of people confirmed to have died from COVID-19 stood at 262,317 since the pandemic first struck India more than a year ago.But a lack of testing in many places meant a lot of deaths and infections were omitted from the official count, and experts say the real numbers could be five to 10 times higher.Bhramar Mukherjee, a professor of epidemiology at the University of Michigan, said most models had predicted a peak this week and that the country’s infections could be nearing an apex.Still, the number of new cases each day is large enough to overwhelm hospitals, she said on Twitter on Thursday. “The keyword is cautious optimism.”The situation is particularly bad in rural areas of Uttar Pradesh, India’s most populous state with a population of more than 240 million. Television pictures have shown families weeping over the dead in rural hospitals or camping in wards to tend the sick.Bodies have washed up in the Ganges, the river that flows through the state, as crematoriums are overwhelmed and wood for funeral pyres is in short supply.The second wave of infections, which erupted in February, has been accompanied by a slowdown in vaccinations, although Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that vaccinations would be open to all adults from May 1.India is the world’s largest vaccine producer but has run low on stocks in the face of the huge demand. As of Thursday, it had fully vaccinated just over 38.2 million people, or about 2.8 percent of a population of about 1.35 billion, government data shows.More than two billion doses of coronavirus vaccines will likely be available in India between August to December this year, top government adviser VK Paul told reporters amid criticism that the government had mishandled the vaccine plan.Those doses would include 750 million of AstraZeneca’s vaccine, as well as 550 million doses of Covaxin, made by Bharat Biotech.“We are going through a phase of finite supply. The entire world is going through this. It takes time to come out of this phase,” Paul said.",Covaxin,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/5/14/india-covid-cases-above-24-million-as-mutant-spreads-across-globe,AL JAZEERA,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""omission"", ""reason"": ""Lack of critical examination on India's vaccination plan and distribution, focusing instead on the spread of the mutant strain."", ""confidence"": 0.8}",yes,omission,"Lack of critical examination on India's vaccination plan and distribution, focusing instead on the spread of the mutant strain."
254,"India celebrates Diwali amid air pollution, COVID fears","Indians across the country are celebrating Diwali, the festival of lights, amid concerns over the coronavirus pandemic and rising air pollution.Diwali is typically celebrated by socialising and exchanging gifts with family and friends. Many light oil lamps or candles to symbolise a victory of light over darkness, and fireworks are set off as part of the celebrations.Last year, celebrations in India were upended by a renewed spike in COVID-19 infections, but festivities this year seem to be back.Even though the government has asked people to avoid large gatherings, markets have been buzzing ahead of Diwali, with eager crowds buying flowers, lanterns and candles.As dusk fell on Wednesday, more than 900,000 earthen lamps were lit and kept burning for 45 minutes in the northern city of Ayodhya in Uttar Pradesh state, retaining the Guinness World Record it set last year.As part of the Diwali celebrations, the city last year lit 606,569 oil lamps.The lamps were lit at Ram ki Pauri, at the banks of Saryu River, a stunning spectacle for thousands of visitors who thronged its shores while ignoring coronavirus social-distancing norms.A laser and fireworks show followed, illuminating the city’s lanes and river banks. Thousands of city residents also lit lamps at their houses and temples.The festival is being celebrated at a time when India’s pandemic crisis has largely subsided.On Friday, the country recorded nearly 13,000 new coronavirus cases and 461 deaths, a far cry from earlier this year when India buckled under a few hundred thousand new infections every day.Overall, it has recorded more than 35 million infections and more than 459,000 deaths, according to the health ministry. These figures, as elsewhere, are likely to be underestimated.Even states where infections were swelling a few weeks ago, such as Kerala along the tropical Malabar Coast, have seen a sustained decline.India also celebrated administering its billionth COVID-19 vaccine dose last month, further boosting confidence that life is returning to normal.Still, experts have warned that the festival season could bring a renewed spike in infections if COVID-19 health measures are not enforced.There are also worries over air pollution, which typically shrouds northern India under a toxic grey smog at this time as temperatures dip and winter settles in.On Diwali night, people also light up the sky with firecrackers – their smoke causing pollution that takes days to clear.India’s capital was choked in a shroud of thick, toxic smog on Thursday as millions gathered with family and friends to celebrate the festival.New Delhi is ranked as one of the most polluted cities globally, with a hazardous melange of factory emissions, car exhaust and smoke from agricultural fires settling in the skies over its 20 million people each winter.A 2020 report by Swiss organisation IQAir found 22 of the world’s 30 most polluted cities were in India, with New Delhi ranked the most polluted capital globally.The same year, the Lancet said 1.67 million deaths were attributable to air pollution in India in 2019, including almost 17,500 in the capital.People across the sprawling city woke up on Thursday to find themselves enveloped in a grey-yellow blanket of haze, with experts warning of worse to come in the days ahead.Levels of PM2.5 – the smallest and most harmful particles polluting the air – peaked at an average of 389 on Thursday, according to readings from metropolitan monitoring stations run by government air quality agency SAFAR.The figure is more than 15 times higher than the safe limits set by the World Health Organization.SAFAR advised residents to avoid outdoor activities and wear masks when outside.The agency also warned that illegal fireworks traditionally used to mark the Diwali festival could further heighten pollution levels on Friday.New Delhi and many neighbouring cities have banned or highly restricted their use to avoid a spike in air pollution.While there is no nationwide ban on bursting firecrackers, a number of states have imposed restrictions to stem the pollution, with some allowing their residents to light so-called green crackers for a certain number of hours.Green crackers produce fewer emissions than normal firecrackers. In the past, similar bans have often been flouted.",Covaxin,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/11/4/india-diwali-festival-air-pollution-covid,AL JAZEERA,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""omission"", ""reason"": ""The article mentions the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on India, but does not provide a balanced view by including counter-narratives or alternative perspectives."", ""confidence"": 0.8}",yes,omission,"mentions the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on India, but does not provide a balanced view by including counter-narratives or alternative perspectives."
255,What we know about COVID variant first found in India,"India is witnessing the world’s sharpest spike in coronavirus infections, with hospitals across the country running out of beds, oxygen and medicines.Scientists are studying what led to the surge, and particularly whether a variant of the novel coronavirus first detected in India is to blame.The variant, named B.1.617, has been reported in 17 countries, raising global concern.Here are the basics:The B.1.617 variant contains two key mutations to the outer “spike” portion of the virus that attaches to human cells, said senior Indian virologist Shahid Jameel.The World Health Organization (WHO) said the predominant lineage of B.1.617 was first identified in India last December, although an earlier version was spotted in October 2020.On Monday, the WHO classified it as a “variant of concern”, which also includes variants first detected in the UK, Brazil and South Africa.Some initial studies showed the Indian variant spreads more easily.“There is increased transmissibility demonstrated by some preliminary studies,” Maria Van Kerkhove, WHO’s technical lead on COVID-19, said, adding it needs more information about the Indian variant to understand how much of it is circulating.It is hard to say.Laboratory-based studies of limited sample size suggest potential increased transmissibility, according to the WHO.The picture is complicated because the highly transmissible B.117 variant first detected in the UK is behind spikes in some parts of India.In New Delhi, cases related to the variant detected in the UK almost doubled during the second half of March, according to Sujeet Kumar Singh, director of the National Centre for Disease Control.The variant first found in India, though, is widely present in Maharashtra, the country’s hardest-hit state, Singh said.Prominent US disease modeller Chris Murray, from the University of Washington, said the sheer magnitude of infections in India in a short period of time suggests an “escape variant” may be overpowering any prior immunity from natural infections in those populations.“That makes it most likely that it’s B.1.617,” he said.But Murray cautioned that gene sequencing data on the coronavirus in India is sparse, and that many cases are also being driven by the UK and South African variants.Carlo Federico Perno, head of Microbiology and Immunology Diagnostics at Rome’s Bambino Gesù Hospital, said the Indian variant could not alone be the reason for India’s huge surge, pointing instead to large social gatherings.Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been criticised for his handling of the pandemic, and allowing massive political rallies and religious festivals which have been super-spreader events in recent weeks.One bright spot is that vaccines may be protective.White House chief medical adviser Anthony Fauci said that preliminary evidence from lab studies suggest Covaxin, a vaccine developed in India, appears capable of neutralising the variant.Public Health England said it was working with international partners but that there is currently no evidence that the Indian variant and two related variants cause more severe disease or render the vaccines currently deployed less effective.“Our view is that this is a highly transmissible variant … [but] at this point in time, our view is it is less likely to be able to escape vaccination than some of the other variants,” English Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty said on Monday.“We don’t have anything to suggest that our diagnostics, our therapeutics and our vaccines don’t work. This is important,” said Van Kerkhove at WHO.",Covaxin,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/5/11/what-we-know-about-indian-covid-variant-who-calls-of-concern,AL JAZEERA,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""omission"", ""reason"": ""The article does not mention the potential negative consequences of Operation Sindoor and Ayodhya Ram Mandir on the spread of COVID-19, despite mentioning large social gatherings as a contributing factor."", ""confidence"": 0.8}",no,none,no bias
256,More Indian-made COVID vaccines will be released: Modi,"Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi says the country would release more locally made COVID-19 vaccines as New Delhi continues to save the lives of people in other countries by exporting medicines and vaccines.“So far only two made-in-India vaccines have been introduced, but in the future, many more vaccines will be made available,” Modi said on Thursday at a virtual meeting of the World Economic Forum, adding India had “fulfilled its global responsibilities” by setting up infrastructure related to vaccination.The South Asian nation, one of the world’s biggest makers of medicines, is producing two vaccines – Covishield, licensed from Oxford University and AstraZeneca, and Covaxin, developed at home by Bharat Biotech in partnership with Indian Council of Medical Research.Covishield is being produced at the Serum Institute of India, the world’s biggest vaccine maker, located in Pune city in the western state of Maharashtra.Indian firm Zydus Cadila is also developing an indigenous DNA-based vaccine, ZyCov-Da, at its facility in the city of Ahmedabad in Modi’s home state, Gujarat.India is exporting the vaccine to several countries, including providing hundreds of thousands of free immunisation doses to neighbouring countries, where it is vying for influence with its rival China.India began vaccinating people on January 16 and has so far given one shot to almost 2.4 million health workers and others, with the aim of inoculating 300 million Indians by July.Modi also said India will issue health identity cards to its 1.3 billion citizens.He said India has taken steps to overcome the shock posed by the spread of COVID-19 and has been carrying out reforms to improve its economy.India’s economy, Asia’s third-largest, is expected to contract 7.7 percent in the current financial year ending in March, the worst performance in 40 years as a COVID-19 related lockdown hit the economic and industrial activity.“I want to assure the business world that the situation will now change rapidly on the economic front also,” he said, adding India’s push for self-reliance through local manufacturing is aimed at turning the country into an export hub.India believes in opening all sectors for private players and would provide support to companies looking at investing in the country, he added.“Our [self-reliance policy] is committed towards global good and global supply chain. India has the capacity, capability and reliability to strengthen the global supply chain,” he said.The World Economic Forum’s annual meeting at the start of the year is taking place online because of the pandemic. In normal years, thousands of top politicians and corporate leaders gather in the Swiss mountain resort of Davos.",Covaxin,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/1/29/more-indian-made-covid-vaccines-will-be-released-modi,AL JAZEERA,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""source"", ""reason"": ""The article relies heavily on a single source (Narendra Modi) without providing counter-perspectives from other experts or organizations."", ""confidence"": 0.8}",no,none,no source bias
257,EU yet to decide on legal case against AstraZeneca shortage,"The European Commission has said no decision had yet been taken on whether to launch legal action against AstraZeneca over a shortfall in deliveries of coronavirus vaccine doses.The EU executive – which negotiated contracts with vaccine producers on behalf of the European Union’s member states – could seek an injunction because the company had not yet made a formal commitment on planned deliveries.More than three million people worldwide have died from the coronavirus pandemic, while at least 143 million other cases have been reported.This live blog is now closed. These were Thursday’s updates:22 Apr 2021 - 19:36 GMTThe African Union’s disease control body has urged countries to use COVID-19 vaccines donated to them quickly to save lives and livelihoods, after confusion in Malawi and South Sudan about whether doses they received had expired.“My appeal to member states is: if we are doing our part to mobilise these vaccines, you do your part and use the vaccines,” John Nkengasong, director of the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC), told a news conference.Malawi plans to destroy more than 16,000 doses of AstraZeneca’s vaccine manufactured by the Serum Institute of India because the shots were not administered before the April 13 expiry date on the packaging. The doses were supplied via the AU thanks to a donation from telecoms group MTN.South Sudan has set aside 59,000 doses supplied by the AU and does not plan to use them because of the same expiry issue, a government official told Reuters last week.But Nkengasong, the continent’s top public health official, said the Africa CDC had informed countries receiving the donations that the shots could be used until mid-July, based on a further analysis conducted by the Serum Institute.”22 Apr 2021 - 19:00 GMTThe COVAX vaccine-sharing plan said it is seeking to bolster its supplies of COVID-19 vaccines for poor countries from new manufacturers as it aims to mitigate supply problems of the AstraZeneca shot from India.The global programme – co-led by the GAVI vaccine alliance and the World Health Organization (WHO) – said that while it was hoping to restart deliveries of doses from India’s Serum Institute to COVAX participating countries “as soon as possible”, it was also looking for additional potential supplies.Serum said on Wednesday it hoped to raise its monthly output of the AstraZeneca COVID-19 shot to 100 million doses by July from 60-70 million now, later than a previous timeline of end-May.“Anticipating these types of barriers is one of the reasons COVAX has sought to diversify its portfolio from the beginning,” a GAVI spokesperson told Reuters. “We are in conversations with other manufacturers of other candidates on supply schedules.22 Apr 2021 - 18:52 GMTThe European Commission has said no decision had yet been taken on whether to launch legal action against AstraZeneca over a shortfall in deliveries of coronavirus vaccine doses, after Ireland’s health minister said the case had been initiated.Health Minister Stephen Donnelly on Thursday told the Irish parliament that “a legal case has been initiated by the commission and earlier this week I have joined Ireland as one of the parties to that legal case.”“No decision to launch legal actions has been taken at this point in time,” a spokesman for the European Commission said.Read more here.22 Apr 2021 - 18:05 GMTDevelopers of the Russian COVID-19 vaccine say they signed a deal with a leading Egyptian pharmaceutical company to manufacture more than 40 million doses annually in Cairo.The Russian Direct Investment Fund, along with Egypt’s Minapharm and its Berlin-based subsidiary, issued a joint press release saying the technology transfer will begin immediately. It expects the roll out of the Sputnik V vaccine in the third quarter of 2021.The production will take place in Minapharm’s biotech facility in Cairo for global distribution.CEO of the Russian Direct Investment Fund Kirill Dmitriev says in the release: “The Russian vaccine is highly efficient and trusted by regulators around the world and makes a huge contribution in the fight against coronavirus.”22 Apr 2021 - 17:39 GMTThe peak of the third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in France “appears to be behind us”, Prime Minister Jean Castex said, and travel restrictions will be relaxed from early next month.Castex told reporters there had been a “genuine fall in the circulation of the virus over the last 10 days”, confirming that restrictions confining people to a 10km (six-mile) radius of their homes would be dropped from May 3.New infections rose by 34,318 on Thursday, a 4.25 percent increase versus the same day last week, the lowest rise since March 13. The seven-day moving average of daily new cases stood at 31,532, falling below 32,000 for the first time since March 23.22 Apr 2021 - 16:44 GMTThe European Commission is looking to launch legal action against AstraZeneca for underdelivering COVID-19 vaccine doses to the EU, hobbling the bloc’s early rollout of jabs, diplomats said.The EU executive informed member state envoys of its plans on Wednesday, the diplomats told AFP, confirming information first published by the Politico website.They said any lawsuit against AstraZeneca would begin in a Belgian court — the jurisdiction agreed under the commission’s contract with the British-Swedish pharmaceutical company.A Commission spokesman, Stefan De Keersmaecker said: “As you know, AstraZeneca is not delivering the number of doses which have been agreed upon in the contract… This is one of the reasons why we keep our options open together with member states to take any further steps.”The Syrian government received a batch of 203,000 COVID-19 vaccines, the health minister said, part of a push to speed up a sluggish inoculation process in the war-torn country.The arrival of the United Nations-secured jabs came as a new wave of infections overwhelms medical centers around Syria. The AstraZeneca vaccines are part of a campaign aiming to vaccinate 20 percent of the country’s population before the end of the year.Health Minister Hassan Ghabbash made the announcement during a news conference held in the capital Damascus. He said the vaccine will be given first to frontline workers, the elderly and those with chronic diseases.The Syrian government has registered over 21,500 cases – including 1,483 deaths – in areas under its control since the first case was reported in March 2020. Over 21,000 infections and over 640 deaths have been recorded in rebel-held northwestern Syria, while the Kurdish areas in the northeast registered 14,400 cases including 477 deaths.22 Apr 2021 - 16:11 GMTA Norwegian climber hoping to summit Everest has confirmed that he has tested positive for COVID-19, in a blow to Nepal’s hopes for a bumper mountaineering season on the world’s highest peak.The pandemic wiped out last year’s season but Nepal has eased quarantine rules in an effort to attract more climbers despite the difficulties of treating them if they contract the virus.“My diagnosis is COVID-19,” Erlend Ness told AFP in a Facebook message. “I’m doing ok now… The hospital is taking care (of me).”Ness was evacuated from the slopes by helicopter and taken to a hospital in the Nepali capital Kathmandu after spending time at Everest base camp.Norwegian broadcaster NRK, which interviewed him, reported that a sherpa in his party had also tested positive.22 Apr 2021 - 15:44 GMTSweden, which has shunned lockdowns throughout the pandemic, will postpone a tentative plan to ease some COVID-19 restrictions, due to the ongoing high levels of new infections, the government said.Sweden is experiencing a third wave of the virus and the number of patients being treated in intensive care is at the highest level since the spring of last year.“When the strain on healthcare eases and the spread of infection drops, only then will the government be ready to start lifting restrictions,” Prime Minister Stefan Lofven told a news conference. “But we are not there yet.”The restrictions will be prolonged until mid-May and mean restaurants will have to close at 8.30pm and that shops and malls can only let in limited numbers of customers. Sport venues and public pools will remain effectively closed to visitors.22 Apr 2021 - 14:58 GMTIndia reported 314,835 fresh coronavirus infections on Thursday as health officials warned that the country’s health infrastructure was overwhelmed.“Right now there are no beds, no oxygen. Everything else is secondary,” said Shahid Jameel, a virologist and director of the Trivedi School of Biosciences at Ashoka University.Six hospitals in New Delhi had run out of oxygen, according to a tally shared by the city government, and the city’s deputy chief minister said neighbouring states were holding back supplies for their own needs.Another 2,104 people died in the space of a day, taking India’s cumulative toll to 184,657, according to the health ministry data.The previous record rise in cases was in the United States, which had 297,430 new cases on one day in January, though its infection rate has since fallen sharply.22 Apr 2021 - 14:57 GMTTunisian hospitals have run out of intensive care beds amid a surge in COVID-19 cases, a member of the independent scientific committee that advises the government said.Amenallah Messadi told Reuters the health system had been pushed to the point of collapse by a rise in cases driven by the more infectious coronavirus variant first detected in Britain.“The situation is very critical, medical staff are exhausted, ICUs have reached their maximum capacity and deaths are on the rise,” he said.Tunisia has recorded 291,000 coronavirus cases and about 10,000 deaths. The daily death rate which has hovered around 80 for the past two weeks reached 95 on Tuesday.22 Apr 2021 - 14:53 GMTAccording to India’s health ministry, deaths rose by a record 2,104 in the past 24 hours, raising the country’s overall death toll to 184,657.But how has India’s economy held up?After shrinking by a record 24.4 percent in the three months through June 2020 – which was “consistent with the stringency of the lockdown” the government imposed at the time, according to Barclays India Economist Rahul Bajoria – economic activity picked up and eked out a growth rate of 0.4 percent for the quarter ending December compared to the same period the year before, latest figures show.Read more here.",Covaxin,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/4/22/record-covid-cases-in-india-as-world-grapples-with-virus-live,AL JAZEERA,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""selection"", ""reason"": ""The article focuses on the EU's potential legal action against AstraZeneca and the challenges faced by various countries in obtaining COVID-19 vaccines, while giving relatively little attention to other vaccine manufactu"", ""confidence"": 0.8}",no,none,no selection bias
258,Second COVID surge grips India on ‘people’s curfew’ anniversary,"India has reported 46,951 new coronavirus cases, its worst single-day rise since early November, and 212 new COVID-19 deaths, the most since early January.On Monday, total deaths in the country stood at 159,967 and infections at 11.65 million, the highest in the world after the United States and Brazil.The grim figures came on the first anniversary of what Prime Minister Narendra Modi called a “Janta curfew” (people’s curfew), marking the start of a chaotic nationwide lockdown last year that left many people jobless and shrank the economy.India’s richest and most industrialised state, Maharashtra, has reported 30,535 new coronavirus infections in the past 24 hours, forcing local authorities to reopen some quarantine centres. The centres had been closed after the national daily caseload began to decline after peaking at nearly 100,000 cases a day in September.Maharashtra, home to India’s financial capital Mumbai, has been accounting for more than half of the country’s total cases after the full reopening of its economy unleashed a second wave of infections late last month.Maharashtra recorded 99 COVID-19 deaths in the past 24 hours, a case fatality rate of 2.15 percent, notably higher than the national figure of about 1.5 percent.Some hospitals in the country’s worst-affected state have begun to run short of beds.Nearly a dozen other states, including Punjab, Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka, home to the tech hub of Bengaluru, have also seen a spike in cases in the past few weeks.In some parts of India, most people still go out without masks and flout advice on social distancing, including politicians campaigning in four states where elections will begin later this month.The health ministry has also warned that a huge gathering of devotees for a Hindu festival could lead to a spike in cases as people from all over the country flock to the banks of the Ganges river in the holy northern town of Haridwar.Local authorities have said they expect 150 million visitors at the weeks-long Mahakumbh that began this month and peaks in April. The festival is held only once every 12 years, and many Hindus believe bathing in the river during this period absolves people of sins.The surge in cases has also brought into focus India’s low immunisation rate relative to its population, despite it being the world’s biggest maker of vaccines.India has administered more than 44 million doses since starting its vaccination campaign in mid-January but wants to cover 300 million – one-fifth of its 1.35 billion population – by August.India has donated or sold more than 60 million vaccine doses to 76 countries, saying some shipments are necessary to meet contractual obligations.As vaccine demand rises at home, top vaccine manufacturer the Serum Institute of India (SII) has delayed further shipments of the AstraZeneca shot to the United Kingdom, Brazil, Saudi Arabia and Morocco.Gripped by a second wave of infections, some states are seeking to accelerate the vaccination drive to include younger people.Maharashtra has offered to make doses in the province to ease the supply pressure on SII and vaccine developer Bharat Biotech, whose COVAXIN shot is also being used in the country’s inoculation programme.",Covaxin,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/3/22/second-covid-surge-grips-india-on-peoples-curfew-anniversary,AL JAZEERA,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""source"", ""reason"": ""The article relies on the Indian government's and health ministry's statements without providing counter-sources or critical perspectives, suggesting a preferential reliance on sources that support one viewpoint."", ""confidence"": 0.8}",no,none,no source bias
259,Third COVID wave to hit India by October: Reuters poll of experts,"A third wave of coronavirus infections is likely to hit India by October, and although it will be better controlled than the latest outbreak the pandemic will remain a public health threat for at least another year, according to a Reuters news agency’s poll of medical experts.The June 3-17 snap survey of 40 healthcare specialists, doctors, scientists, virologists, epidemiologists and professors from around the world showed a significant rise in vaccinations will likely provide some cover to a fresh outbreak.Of those who ventured a prediction, at least 85 percent of respondents, or 21 of 24, said the next wave will hit by October, including three who forecast it as early as August and 12 in September. The remaining three said between November and February.But more than 70 percent of experts, or 24 of 34, said any new outbreak would be better controlled compared with the current one, which has been far more devastating – with shortages of vaccines, medicines, oxygen and hospital beds – than the smaller first surge in infections last year.“It will be more controlled, as cases will be much less because more vaccinations would have been rolled out and there would be some degree of natural immunity from the second wave,” said Dr Randeep Guleria, director at the All India Institute Of Medical Sciences (AIIMS).So far, India has only fully vaccinated about five percent of its estimated 950 million eligible population, leaving many millions vulnerable to infections and deaths.While a majority of healthcare experts predicted the vaccination drive would pick up significantly this year, they cautioned against an early removal of restrictions, as some states have done.When asked if children and those under 18 years would be most at risk in a potential third wave, nearly two-thirds of experts, or 26 of 40, said yes.“The reason being they are a completely virgin population in terms of vaccination because currently there is no vaccine available for them,” said Dr Pradeep Banandur, head of epidemiology department at the National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS).Experts warn the situation could become severe.“If children get infected in large numbers and we are not prepared, there is nothing you can do at the last minute,” said Dr Devi Shetty, a cardiologist at Narayana Health and an adviser to the Karnataka state government on pandemic response planning.“It will be a whole different problem as the country has very, very few paediatric intensive care unit beds, and that is going to be a disaster.”But 14 experts said children were not at risk.Earlier this week, a senior health ministry official said children were vulnerable and susceptible to infections but that analysis has shown a less severe health impact.While 25 of 38 respondents said future coronavirus variants would not make existing vaccines ineffective, in response to a separate question, 30 of 41 experts said the coronavirus will remain a public health threat in India for at least a year.“COVID-19 is a solvable problem, as obviously it was easy to get a solvable vaccine. In two years, India likely will develop herd immunity through vaccine and exposure of the disease,” said Robert Gallo, director of the Institute of Human Virology at the University of Maryland and international scientific adviser, Global Virus Network.",Covaxin,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/6/18/third-covid-wave-india-october-reuters-poll-experts,AL JAZEERA,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""tonality"", ""reason"": ""The article's tone is predominantly cautionary and alarmist, using words like 'devastating', 'disaster', and 'severe' to describe the potential third wave."", ""confidence"": 0.8}",yes,tonality," tone is predominantly cautionary and alarmist, using words like 'devastating', 'disaster', and 'severe' to describe the potential third wave"
260,India set to reopen to tourist visas as COVID situation eases,"India will reopen to tourism from October 15, the government said, after more than a year of closure due to the coronavirus pandemic.Foreign nationals will be able to apply for a visa for the first time since March 2020, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government imposed a strict lockdown in response to the pandemic.“After considering various inputs, the MHA (home ministry) has decided to begin granting fresh Tourist Visas for foreigners coming to India through chartered flights with effect from October 15, 2021,” the home ministry said in a statement on Thursday.It added that foreigners traveling to India via commercial flights will be able to enter on fresh tourist visas starting November 15, 2021.Tourism is an important sector for Asia’s third-largest economy, with the country seeing 10.93 million tourist arrivals in 2019, according to government figures.Restrictions on most categories of foreign visas, such as diplomats and businesspeople, had been gradually lifted but tourists remained barred even as most economic activities resumed.The country of 1.3 billion people was hit by a severe wave of coronavirus infections this year, with about 4,000 daily deaths recorded in the month of May.The spike was blamed on new virus variants and the government allowing sporting events and major celebrations for religious festivals.Cases have since slowed sharply to approximately 20,000 new daily infections and 200 to 300 deaths in recent weeks.The home ministry said all COVID-19 protocols “should be adhered to by the foreign tourists, carriers bringing them into India and all other stakeholders at landing stations”.The vast majority of Indians have been vaccinated with Indian-made AstraZeneca shots, which has been produced by Serum Institute of India. Others have received COVAXIN, a vaccine produced by an Indian company.Earlier this month, India announced fully vaccinated British nationals arriving in India will be subjected to a 10-day mandatory quarantine, in response to similar measures imposed by the UK on Indian nationals.The United Kingdom has not recognised the Indian version of the AstraZeneca vaccine, known as Covishield. India has called the decision “discriminatory” and imposed restrictions on all British arrivals irrespective of their vaccination status.",Covaxin,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/10/7/india-to-reopen-to-tourism-as-covid-19-travel-ban-lifts,AL JAZEERA,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""omission"", ""reason"": ""The article mentions the controversy over Covishield and Covaxin recognition but does not provide a balanced view of both sides, instead framing India's decision as 'discriminatory'."", ""confidence"": 0.8}",yes,omission,"mentions the controversy over Covishield and Covaxin recognition but does not provide a balanced view of both sides, instead framing India's decision as 'discriminatory'."
261,"Now, fears of a COVID surge in India’s northeast","With experts saying the coronavirus is likely spreading in India’s northeastern state of Assam faster than anywhere else in the country, authorities are preparing for a surge in infections by converting a massive stadium and a university into hospitals.Cases in Assam started ticking upward a month ago and the official seven-day average of daily cases in the state on May 9 stood at more than 4,700 cases.But a model run by the University of Michigan – which predicts the current spread of cases before they are actually detected – says infections in Assam are likely occurring as fast as any other place in the country.Add to that recent elections in the state – and the huge political rallies that accompanied them – and experts fear an uncontrolled surge is on the horizon.Worryingly, along with cities on India’s northeastern frontier – which is closer to Myanmar, Bangladesh and Bhutan than it is New Delhi – cases have also started to spike in some remote Himalayan villages.Nationwide, India’s health ministry reported 360,000 new cases in the past 24 hours on Monday, with more than 3,700 deaths.Since the pandemic began, India has recorded more than 22.6 million infections and more than 246,000 deaths – both, experts say, almost certainly undercounts.Officials in Assam were racing to prepare for a virus surge because similar onslaughts have overwhelmed hospitals in much richer Indian states.“We are adding 1,000 beds a week to prepare ourselves in the event of cases spiralling,” said Dr Lakshmanan S, director of the National Health Mission in Assam.The state’s largest government-run hospital, the Guwahati Medical College Hospital, has more than doubled its number of intensive care beds to 220 and health officials are building space for another 200 in the hospital’s parking lot.A football and cricket stadium is being converted into a 430-bed COVID hospital. The private Royal Global University in the main city of Guwahati has been converted into a 1,000-bed hospital.The state is sending doctors, paramedics and medicine to these facilities and the university said it would provide books and newspapers for patients to read.“This is the least we thought we could do in this time of huge crisis for our country,” said Dr AK Pansari, the university chairman.There are 2,100 beds reserved in government centres for COVID-19 patients in Guwahati, with hundreds more planned. This is in addition to the existing 750 beds for patients at private hospitals in the state.Even as infections increased, vaccination rates have fallen in Assam and other states in the region since India expanded its coverage to include all adults on May 1.Adding to concerns is the confirmation that the virus has started spreading into more remote Himalayan villages with poor health infrastructure. These areas are home to Indigenous tribes, who already face some of the lowest access to healthcare in the nation.The region had been largely untouched by the virus but it now appears the virus was spreading in remote villages without people knowing until it was too late.The lack of awareness, resources and the remoteness of these villages is complicating contact tracing in such areas, said Dr Mite Linggi, the medical superintendent at the district hospital at Roing in Arunachal Pradesh state.Despite the limited medical infrastructure and even more limited medical supplies, Linggi said what they really feared were power cuts.“Power is crucial for running oxygen supply.

262,What we know about India COVID variant as virus sweeps South Asia,"India has recorded the world’s sharpest spike in coronavirus infections this month, with political and financial capitals New Delhi and Mumbai running out of hospital beds, oxygen and medicines.Scientists are studying what led to an unexpected surge and particularly whether a variant of the novel coronavirus first detected in India is to blame.The variant, named B.1.617, has been reported in some 17 countries, raising global concern.Here are the basics:The B.1.617 variant contains two key mutations to the outer “spike” portion of the virus that attaches to human cells, said senior Indian virologist Shahid Jameel.The World Health Organization (WHO) said the predominant lineage of B.1.617 was first identified in India last December, although an earlier version was spotted in October 2020.The WHO has described it as a “variant of interest”, suggesting it may have mutations that would make the virus more transmissible, cause more severe disease or evade vaccine immunity.Other strains with known risks, such as those first detected in the United Kingdom, Brazil and South Africa, have been categorised as “variants of concern,” a higher threat level.It is hard to say.The WHO says more study is urgently needed. Laboratory-based studies of limited sample size suggest it may be potentially more transmissible, it concluded.The picture is complicated because the highly transmissible B.117 variant first detected in the UK is behind spikes in some parts of India.In New Delhi, UK variant cases almost doubled during the second half of March, according to Sujeet Kumar Singh, the director of the National Centre for Disease Control.The Indian variant, though, is widely present in Maharashtra, the country’s hardest-hit state, Singh said.Prominent US disease modeller Dr Chris Murray, from the University of Washington, said the sheer magnitude of infections in India in a short period of time suggests an “escape variant” may be overpowering any prior immunity from natural infections in those populations.“That makes it most likely that it’s B.1.617,” he said.But Murray cautioned that gene-sequencing data on the coronavirus in India is sparse and that many cases are also being driven by the UK and South African variants.Dr Carlo Federico Perno, the head of microbiology and immunology diagnostics at Rome’s Bambino Gesù Hospital, said the Indian variant could not alone be the reason for India’s huge surge, pointing instead to large social gatherings.Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been criticised for allowing huge political rallies and religious festivals which have been super-spreader events in recent weeks.One bright spot is that vaccines may be protective.White House chief medical adviser Dr Anthony Fauci said earlier this week that preliminary evidence from laboratory studies suggest Covaxin, a vaccine developed in India, appears capable of neutralising the variant.Public Health England said it was working with international partners but that there is currently no evidence that the Indian variant and two related variants cause more severe disease or render the vaccines currently deployed less effective.",Covaxin,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/4/30/what-we-know-about-india-covid-variant-as-virus-sweeps-south-asia,AL JAZEERA,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""omission"", ""reason"": ""The article does not mention the potential risks of Covaxin vaccine in detail, only mentioning that it may be protective.

263,India’s second COVID wave in maps and charts,"At least one out of every three new COVID-19 cases around the world today is being recorded in India.Wednesday was the country’s deadliest day with 3,293 deaths reported, carrying the total to 201,187 fatalities.The last 24 hours brought 360,960 new cases for the world’s largest single-day total, taking India’s tally of infections to nearly 18 million, as shortages of oxygen, medical supplies and hospital staff compound the crisis.Experts believe the official tally vastly underestimates the actual toll in a nation of 1.35 billion, however.The second wave of infections has seen at least 300,000 people test positive each day for the past week, overwhelming healthcare facilities and crematoriums and fuelling an increasingly urgent international response.According to Reuters, one person is dying of COVID every four minutes in the capital New Delhi, one of the hardest-hit cities.Speaking to Al Jazeera, Dr Ritesh Malik, director of Radix Healthcare in Delhi, said India was going through what is possibly its most challenging situation since the partition in 1947.He described a vulnerable population constantly in search of oxygen, hospital beds and life-saving medicines as infections surge, even among young people. Malik believes India has not yet reached the peak of the crisis, which he expects in the coming week or 10 days.Here is how COVID spread across India’s states since March 2020:India’s hardest-hit state is Maharashtra – home to Mumbai, the nation’s financial hub. The virus has particularly hit India’s densely populated cities, including New Delhi (1,027,715 cases), Pune (796,645 cases) and Bengaluru (653,656 cases).Here is a map of COVID cases in India:The positivity rate, which measures how widespread the virus is in a community, has increased across the country from 4.2 percent to 18.4 percent over the past month.Some states, including Chhattisgarh and Delhi, have reached a nearly 30-percent positivity rate.The positivity rate is the ratio of positive cases to overall tests in a particular location.According to The Caravan magazine, the government-appointed task force for COVID-19 did not hold any meetings in February and March. It only met in January, and then April on 15 and April 21 as cases surged.The sharp increase in cases has strained the healthcare system, causing long lines outside hospitals and families begging to have their loved ones looked at by a doctor.Overwhelmed hospitals are pleading for oxygen supplies.The government has deployed military planes and trains to get oxygen from the far corners of the country as well as overseas.Crematoriums across Delhi said they were full and asked grieving families to wait.The Scroll website reported on April 18 that only 11 out of 50 planned oxygen generation plants had been set up across the country in eight months. In response, the Ministry of Health claimed 162 such plants were planned, of which 32 have been set up.India has administered at least 138 million COVID vaccine doses since January 2021. But with a population of nearly 1.4 billion, this means that less than 10 percent of its population has received at least one dose of the vaccine.India has produced at least 193 million does or approximately 21 percent of global COVID-19 vaccines.  It has exported some 66 million doses to more than 95 countries under the COVAX alliance, including at least 10.61 million as grants.India has two main vaccine manufacturers – The Serum Institute of India (SII) which manufactures Covidshield and Bharat BioTech which makes COVAXIN.In March, the export of these vaccines was banned by the government due to shortages within the country. The import of private, for-purchase vaccines has been allowed and the sale of domestic vaccines permitted in private hospitals.Government funding to the SII was greenlit on April 19 to step up manufacturing to cover India’s needs.The SII and Bharat Biotech will get $400m and $210m each from the Indian government.On Sunday, the US, which had stopped exporting raw materials to India, announced that it would now be helping with the supply of raw materials to help the country fast-track its vaccine production.",Covaxin,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/4/27/indias-second-covid-wave-in-maps-and-charts,AL JAZEERA,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""omission"", ""reason"": ""Lack of critical examination of government's response and potential biases in expert opinions."", ""confidence"": 0.8}",yes,omission,Lack of critical examination of government's response and potential biases in expert opinions.
264,Schools in Indian capital reopen for all classes after 19 months,"New Delhi, India – For the first time in nearly 19 months, 14-year-old Kainat Habeebi attended her classes physically in a school in India’s capital New Delhi.Though the students did not exchange hugs or shake hands, the giggles on their faces filled the Monday morning air at a school in the sprawling city’s Malviya Nagar area.“We are excited to be back at school. The reunion is really a blessing” Habeebi told Al Jazeera.The Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) last week announced that schools would reopen for all classes from November 1 with certain conditions, including ensuring no more than 50 percent attendance and not forcing parents to send their children to school.The schools have also been directed to ensure the complete vaccination of their staff members.Met this special Doctor today in a school class room.Full body check up, injection, medicine prescription, and instructions to ‘avoid icecream..’God…I was missing this…. pic.twitter.com/3HIQc2W433— Manish Sisodia (@msisodia) November 1, 2021All schools in Delhi were shut in March last year following the coronavirus outbreak. They reopened for higher classes in January this year before closing again in April as a brutal second wave of the pandemic devastated India.After a prolonged closure, the classes for senior grades opened again on September 1. But there was no official approval to open the schools for younger children.Habeebi and many other students told Al Jazeera they did not like online learning and would prefer physical classes while maintaining COVID-19 protocols.“During a physical class, all the students remain very attentive and concentrate on their lessons, but that’s not the case with online classes,” Habeebi said.Shabreen, another student who goes by one name, said she is happy to return to school since it was “very difficult” for her to sit in front of a computer screen or mobile phone for hours.“One loses interest. Also, sometimes you miss lessons because of poor internet connectivity.”Garima Sharma, who teaches maths and science at a Delhi government school, told Al Jazeera that teaching during the pandemic had been an “uphill task”.“You cannot teach maths to anyone by speaking up. You have to write step by step to make them understand,” she said. “Online studying is really very messy. You will never know what the student is doing, they might even be sleeping.”Sharma said while she is happy about her school’s reopening, she is also scared as well.“Overall, I am excited to see kids back to school because it’s been a long time they have been staying home. But I am having a mixed feeling. I am scared because COVID is like an acid, as we say in chemistry. It’s very corrosive,” she told Al Jazeera.“We are taking all the precautions. We are making only one student sit on a bench rather than two or more which we used to do before the pandemic. We have also bifurcated sections into sub-sections so less students sit in a particular classroom.”The decision to reopen schools for younger children in Delhi was taken amid a significant drop in COVID cases in the capital, which recorded just four virus-related deaths in October, its lowest since March 2020.On Monday, India’s health ministry reported 12,830 new cases in the last 24 hours. In total, India has reported more than 30 million COVID infections and 458,000 deaths.A vaccination drive that began in January reached a milestone last month when a billion doses of the vaccine were administered. India has fully vaccinated more than 291 million people while another 707 million people have received the first dose.The government aims to fully vaccinate about a billion people by the end of the year. Vaccination for children is also likely to begin soon after a government panel recommended the homegrown Covaxin jab for children in the 2-18 age group.A Delhi government spokesperson told Al Jazeera on condition of anonymity the decision to reopen schools was taken in view of the sizeable decrease in COVID-19 cases.“The government is vigilant. Also, everyone from teaching to non-teaching staff is vaccinated,” he said.“If any school is caught flouting the rules, strict action will be taken,” he added, including “immediately shutting” a school if any virus infection is detected there.Though the children are excited to return to their schools, some concerned parents said they do not want to send their kids to school yet.Drisha Adhikari is a grade four student in a private school in Delhi. On Monday, she took her classes online.“Physical classes are better as we can meet friends and teachers, and they are more fun than online classes,” said Drisha.But her mother Anamika Adhikari said she does not want to send her daughter to school because children in India are not vaccinated yet.“Though I want her to go back to school as soon as possible, I am also worried. Even if schools open completely, I will not send her initially because I want to see how it goes.”",Covaxin,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/11/1/india-new-delhi-schools-reopen-all-classes-covid,AL JAZEERA,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""tonality"", ""reason"": ""The article's tone is generally neutral, but it presents the reopening of schools as a positive development, highlighting the excitement and relief of students and teachers.

265,Indian state gears up to protect children from third COVID wave,"India’s western state of Maharashtra is training thousands of health workers in taking care of children afflicted with COVID-19 as a first line of defence against surges involving new variants, health officials and experts said.The state, home to the financial capital of Mumbai, was the worst hit by a devastating second wave of infections in April and May that killed hundreds of thousands, and is still reporting a quarter of all new cases nationwide.It has reimposed curbs to rein in the fast-spreading Delta variant that has touched off new outbreaks globally, even as daily national tallies stand at their lowest in nearly two months, allowing some states to reopen businesses.“We are training thousands of health workers, who are usually the first point of contact for families, on how to deal with COVID care in children,” Suhas Prabhu, head of the state’s pediatric task force, told Reuters news agency on Tuesday.While there is no data showing children are more vulnerable, a government survey in Mumbai from April to mid-June showed the presence of virus antibodies in at least half of those younger than 18.“The experts are indicating that a sizeable number of children are likely to be infected in the third wave,” said government adviser Dr Subhash Salunke.Paediatric critical care remained a “weak link” in the healthcare system, the former World Health Organization official told Reuters.Some experts warn that a third wave could hit children, and Mumbai has joined other cities in building huge paediatric wards in preparation.“This is good news because it shows that at least half the population below 18 is protected from COVID-19, but we will make sure that we don’t let our guard down,” said Suresh Kakani, Mumbai’s additional municipal commissioner who oversaw the survey.An estimated 1.5 million of Mumbai’s 12.8 million population are younger than 18. Mumbai would repeat the survey every three months, Kakani said.India, which is using AstraZeneca’s domestically produced Covishield doses and the home-grown Covaxin, has yet to approve any vaccines for children.Maharashtra, with a population of more than 114 million, is one of the country’s most populous states, and has reported 50 cases of the new Delta Plus variant that India has designated as being of concern.It is an offshoot of the highly infectious Delta variant that caused a spike in cases in April and May which overwhelmed healthcare facilities, swamping crematoriums.Daily coronavirus cases have been declining across the country over the past three weeks.From 400,000 cases a day in May, daily new infections now stand at 37,566, health ministry data showed on Tuesday. The South Asian nation’s tally stands at 30.31 million, with a death toll of 397,637.But several states that came in for criticism for how they handled the second wave have been sharing plans for how they would handle any third surge in infections.",Covaxin,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/6/29/india-maharashtra-children-third-covid-wave,AL JAZEERA,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""omission"", ""reason"": ""No mention of Covaxin's efficacy or potential issues, only its use in India."", ""confidence"": 0.8}",no,none,no omission bias
266,Operation Sindoor: What’s the significance of India’s Pakistan targets?,"The Indian military launched multiple missile attacks targeting sites in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir early on Wednesday in an attack it called Operation Sindoor. The Pakistani military claims to have retaliated, shooting down multiple Indian military planes.At least 31 Pakistanis have been killed in the six targeted cities, according to Lieutenant Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, the director general of the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) media wing of Pakistan’s military. India says it struck nine sites.But what’s the significance of the cities and sites that India attacked? And what are India and Pakistan saying about those strikes? And why did India launch these attacks in the first place?The missiles were India’s response to the deadly April 22 attack on tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir in Pahalgam, during which 26 men were killed.An armed group called The Resistance Front (TRF), which demands independence for Kashmir, claimed responsibility for the Pahalgam attack. India claims that the TRF is an offshoot of Pakistan-based armed group, the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT). Islamabad has denied its involvement in the Pahalgam attack and has asked for a neutral investigation into the incident.However, since the attack, India has suspended its participation in the Indus Waters Treaty that Pakistan relies on for its water supply. Pakistan has responded by threatening to suspend its participation in the Simla Agreement, a pact signed in 1972 following the Indo-Pakistan War. Both countries have also scaled back their diplomatic ties, and each has expelled the other’s citizens.India claims it hit “terrorist infrastructure”, targeting organisations including the LeT and Jaish-e-Muhammad (JeM), an armed group based in Pakistan which claimed responsibility for a suicide bombing in February 2019, which killed 40 Indian paramilitary soldiers in Pulwama in Indian-administered Kashmir.In a briefing on Wednesday, Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri insisted that the missile strikes “focused on dismantling the terrorist infrastructure and disabling terrorists likely to be sent across to India”.Joining Misri in the briefing, Indian military officials Colonel Sofiya Qureshi and Wing Commander Vyomika Singh detailed the operation. Five of the nine sites that India hit, they said, were in Pakistan-administered Kashmir. The remaining four were in Punjab – in Bahawalpur, Muridke, Shakar Garh and a village near Sialkot.During the briefing, the Indian military showed a map marking out what it claimed were 21 “terrorist camps” in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir. Al Jazeera has not been able to independently verify the claims of either the Indian or Pakistani militaries.Chaudhry of the ISPR described the Indian strikes as an “unprovoked attack, targeting innocent people”. He indicated that India had launched a total of 24 strikes across six locations in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir.Chaudhry said at least 31 civilians, including women and children, had been killed, and dozens more were injured. He claimed mosques and residential areas were targeted, killing and injuring civilians.The Indian missile strikes represent the most extensive attacks on Pakistani soil outside the four wars that the nuclear-armed neighbours have fought. They also mark the first time since the war of 1971 that India has attacked Punjab, Pakistan’s most populated province and historical and economic hub.Unlike previous aerial attacks by India in Pakistan or in Pakistan-administered Kashmir, some of these strikes targeted large population centres. Muridke is next to Lahore, Pakistan’s second-most populous city. Sialkot and Bahawalpur are major cities, too.But many of the sites chosen as targets by India also hold specific strategic importance, at least from New Delhi’s perspective. Here’s a breakdown:Muridke is a city in Punjab’s Sheikhupura District, peppered with totems of historical memory from the Mughal, Mauryan and Gupta eras.Chaudhry said a mosque named Masjid Ummul Qura was targeted with four strikes. One man was killed and one man was injured as a result. Two people have been missing from this location, Chaudhry said, adding that surrounding residential quarters have also been damaged in these attacks.But the town, according to India and much of the international community, also hosts the headquarters of the Jamat-ud-Dawa, a charity organisation that New Delhi insists is a front for the LeT.On Wednesday, India’s Qureshi claimed that Indian missiles struck the LeT’s Markaz Taiba camp in Muridke. The Indian army claimed that key perpetrators of the 2008 Mumbai attack – including Ajmal Kasab, the sole gunman who was captured alive after that assault on India’s financial capital – were trained at that camp.Meanwhile, images emerging from Muridke showed rescuers searching for victims amid the debris of a damaged government health and education complex.Chaudhry said that four Indian missiles struck Ahmedpur Sharqia, a town near Bahawalpur, targeting a mosque named Masjid Subhan, which was destroyed in the attack. He said that at least five people were killed in the attack, including two men, two women, and a three-year-old girl. Additionally, he said, 31 people were injured – 25 men and six women. He added that four “residential quarters”, where civilian families were living, were damaged.But Qureshi said India had hit the headquarters of the JeM, called Markaz Subhanallah. India described the site as a hub for “recruitment, training and indoctrination”.Muzaffarabad is the capital city of Pakistan-administered Kashmir, located at the confluence of the Jhelum and Neelum rivers. Muzaffarabad is sustained by its cottage industry ecosystem, including furniture making, wood carving, garment making and embroidery work, according to the State Bank of Pakistan.Chaudhry said that a mosque called Masjid e Bilal was hit in Muzaffarabad, and a “young girl was injured”.But Qureshi said India hit a LeT training centre, Sawai Nala camp in Muzaffarabad, 30km (19 miles) away from the Line of Control (LoC), the de facto border that separates Indian-administered and Pakistan-administered Kashmir. She claimed that those responsible for multiple attacks, including the April 22 Pahalgam killings, were trained at this camp.The Indian military officials also said they attacked a Jaish-e-Muhammad “staging area”, the Syedna Bilal camp in Muzaffarabad. A staging area refers to a place where people, vehicles and equipment are assembled and readied before being assigned a mission.Kotli is a city along the Poonch river and is an agricultural and tourist hub.Chaudhry said a mosque named Masjid Abbas was targeted in Kotli. A 16-year-old girl and an 18-year-old boy were killed. At least two other people were injured, he added.Qureshi, however, said that India hit a LeT base, Gulpur camp, about 30km (19 miles) away from the LoC. The Indian army added that it also struck what it called the Abbas camp in Kotli, 13km (8 miles) away from the LoC, where Qureshi said up to 15 “terrorists” could be trained at a time.Qureshi said India has also hit Mehmoona Joya, which she described as a facility of the Hizbul Mujahideen (HuM), a rebel group based in Indian-administered Kashmir. The HuM was founded by separatist leader Muhammad Ahsan Dar in September 1989, with a pro-Pakistan ideology, calling for India to leave the parts of Kashmir that it administers.Qureshi claimed India struck what India called the Barnala camp in Bhimber, about 9km (5.6 miles) away from the LoC. She claimed that fighters were trained in using weapons, improvised explosive devices (IEDs) and in jungle survival at this camp.Pakistani officials had not mentioned Bhimber as the site of any of the Indian attacks by late Wednesday evening. However, Bhimber is just south of Kotli, so it is unclear whether a missile strike on Bhimber is being counted by Pakistan as among the attacks on Kotli.Sialkot is one of Pakistan’s most important industrial centres for the manufacture of surgical items, sporting goods and leather products.Chaudhry said that a village north of Sialkot called Kotli Loharan was targeted in two strikes. One of these strikes misfired and did not explode, while the other landed in an open field, resulting in no damage, Chaudhry said.India’s Qureshi and Singh, however, claimed that India had struck what they called the Sarjal camp in Sialkot. They claimed this was the training centre for those responsible for the killing of four police officers in March this year in Indian-administered Kashmir.Chaudhry said Shakar Garh was targeted with two strikes and reported “minor damage” to a “small hospital, a dispensary”.However, Indian military officials have not mentioned Shakar Garh among the places targeted in the May 7 strikes.",Operation Sindoor,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/7/operation-sindoor-whats-the-significance-of-indias-pakistan-targets,AL JAZEERA,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""framing"", ""reason"": ""The article frames the Indian military's actions as a response to 'terrorist infrastructure' and 'dismantling terrorist camps', while also highlighting the potential civilian casualties.

267,"India launches Operation Sindoor, exchanges heavy fire with Pakistan","India’s military has launched Operation Sindoor, striking nine sites in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, prompting swift retaliation from Islamabad in the worst fighting in more than two decades between the nuclear-armed neighbours as fears of a wider, prolonged war grow.Pakistan said on Wednesday that at least 26 people were killed and 46 others injured in the Indian attacks, accusing New Delhi of committing an “act of war”. India said at least eight people were killed by Pakistani shelling.The leaders of both countries are holding crisis meetings on Wednesday.The Indian strike and counterattack by Pakistan come amid soaring tensions, after a deadly attack last month on tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir that New Delhi blamed on Islamabad, which denied any involvement.In a statement early on Wednesday, India’s government said its military had attacked “terrorist infrastructure in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir from where terrorist attacks against India have been planned and directed”.“Our actions have been focused, measured and non-escalatory in nature. No Pakistani military facilities have been targeted. India has demonstrated considerable restraint in selection of targets and method of execution,” it said.The missiles struck locations in Pakistan-administered Kashmir and the country’s eastern Punjab province.Al Jazeera’s Kamal Hyder, reporting from Islamabad, said the cities of Muzaffarabad and Kotli, both in Pakistan-administered Kashmir, were among the targets of the Indian strikes.“Pakistani Defence Minister Khawaja Asif, speaking to a foreign TV network, confirmed that at least five Indian aircraft have been shot down and that a number of Indian soldiers have been taken prisoner,” Hyder said.“Pakistan said that it would respond to any Indian attack against Pakistan, and Pakistan is now responding to that Indian attack,” he said.“Heavy shelling has now resumed on the Line of Control that separates Pakistan-administered Kashmir from Indian-administered Kashmir,” he added.A Pakistani military spokesman had earlier told the broadcaster Geo that at least five locations, including two mosques, had been hit. He also said that Pakistan’s response was under way, without providing details.In Punjab, missiles hit a mosque in the city of Bahawalpur, killing a child and wounding two civilians, the military said.International Crisis Group’s Senior Analyst for India, Praveen Donthi, says that the “escalation between India and Pakistan has already reached a larger scale than during the last major crisis in 2019” with “potentially dire consequences”.“Domestic emotions are high on both sides, fuelling the danger of further escalation,” he said, but “India and Pakistan should choose diplomacy, as any further military action carries unacceptable risks.”Following India’s attacks, the armies of the two sides exchanged intense shelling and heavy gunfire across their frontier in disputed Kashmir in at least three places, the Reuters news agency reported, quoting police and witnesses.United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called for maximum restraint from both sides.“The secretary-general is very concerned about the Indian military operations across the Line of Control and international border. He calls for maximum military restraint from both countries,” Guterres’s spokesperson said.“The world cannot afford a military confrontation between India and Pakistan.”United States President Donald Trump said the clashes were “a shame”.“I just hope it ends very quickly,” Trump said at the White House.US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that he is also closely monitoring the situation, adding that he hopes it will end “quickly”.The eruption of violence comes amid heightened tensions between the nuclear-armed neighbours, in the aftermath of an attack on tourists in Pahalgam in Indian-administered Kashmir last month.India blamed Pakistan for the violence, in which 26 men were killed, and promised to respond. Pakistan denied that it had anything to do with the killings.Nitasha Kaul, the director of the Centre for the Study of Democracy at the University of Westminster, London, said the strikes are “very concerning”.“Once again, the worst affected are going to be the people in the region, the Kashmiris, who are caught between the competing and proprietorial and rival postures and attitudes of India and Pakistan,” Kaul told Al Jazeera.Still, she said, the escalation is “not that surprising, because within India … there has been a domestic pressure building up for a more militarist response, given the fact that there is a particularly hyper-nationalist government in power.“In that sense, sadly, this was a countdown to a greater escalation, and hopefully it won’t proceed much further beyond what has already happened with these strikes,” Kaul added.",Operation Sindoor,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/6/india-launches-attacks-on-several-sites-in-pakistan,AL JAZEERA,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""framing"", ""reason"": ""The article frames India's military action as a 'strike' and 'retaliation', while Pakistan's response is described as 'swift retaliation'.

268,Why did India strike Pakistan? All we know about Operation Sindoor,"Islamabad, Pakistan – Parts of Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir were rocked by multiple missile attacks by India early on Wednesday morning, in which at least 31 people, including a three-year-old child, died.Pakistan’s military said Indian missiles struck six cities. That included four different places in Punjab province — the first time that India has hit Pakistan’s most populous state since the 1971 war between the neighbours. The remaining two places targeted were Muzaffarabad and Kotli, both in Pakistan-administered Kashmir.India claimed that its “Operation Sindoor” targeted nine sites with “terrorist infrastructure”.Pakistan scrambled its jets in response and claimed it had brought down five Indian planes – an assertion to which India has not yet responded.The Indian attack came 15 days after the deadly attack on tourists in the picturesque Pahalgam town in Indian-administered Kashmir on April 22, for which India blamed armed groups which it claimed were backed by Pakistan. Islamabad denied any role in that attack.Now, the nuclear-armed neighbours stand on the precipice of a full-blown military conflict.Here is what we know about India’s attack, Pakistan’s response, and the background of this conflict so far.Pakistani military spokesperson Lieutenant General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, in an early morning news conference, said Indian missiles targeted four locations in Punjab and two in Pakistan-administered Kashmir.The attack took place at about 1am on Wednesday (20:00 GMT, Tuesday).The biggest attack was in Ahmedpur Sharqia, near Bahawalpur city in Punjab. According to Chaudhry, a mosque compound was hit and at least five people were killed, including a three-year-old girl.Other attacks took place in Muridke city, a village near the city of Sialkot, and Shakar Garh, all in Punjab.Two locations in Pakistan-administered Kashmir – Muzaffarabad and Kotli – were also hit, and two mosques were destroyed, according to Pakistani authorities. A 16-year-old girl and an 18-year-old boy were among those killed in the attacks, they said.Chaudhry said at least 31 Pakistanis were killed in all and dozens more were injured in the attack.The Punjab province declared a state of emergency, with hospitals and security forces on high alert, and schools shut on Wednesday.Soon after the Indian attacks, Pakistan’s leadership, both political and military, said the country had engaged its defences and its fighter jets were “airborne”.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, in a post on the social media platform X, said a reply was “being given” to India.Overnight, several claims were made by the Pakistanis, including shooting down up to five Indian jets, including three Rafales, the modern fighter planes which India procured from France in recent years.Besides Chaudhry, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar, as well as Defence Minister Khawaja Asif, also claimed on international news outlets that Pakistan had downed multiple Indian jets.However, Pakistan’s military also said India had fired all of its missiles from Indian airspace. In other words, if Pakistan shot down Indian planes, it fired at them while they were in Indian airspace.Indian authorities have yet to comment on the claims or whether all Indian air force planes that participated in the strikes returned securely to their respective bases.The latest round of conflict between the two nuclear-armed nations came following the attack in Baisaran valley in the Pahalgam region of Indian-administered Kashmir. Gunmen killed 26 men – 25 tourists and a local pony rider – after segregating them from women.India has for years blamed Pakistan for supporting, arming and training the armed groups, which it accuses of fomenting trouble in the valley. Pakistan has insisted that it provides only moral and diplomatic support to Kashmir’s secessionist movement.Following the attack last month, India blamed an obscure group, The Resistance Front (TRF), and claimed that it was a Pakistan-backed group with a haven there. Pakistan, while issuing a condemnation, vehemently denied its involvement and demanded a “transparent, credible, impartial” investigation into the incident.India, which also targeted Pakistan in 2019 and 2016 following attacks on its troops, said it would retaliate, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi saying the country would pursue the Kashmir attackers to “the ends of the earth”.However, more than two weeks later, Indian soldiers are still combing the forests of Kashmir, searching for the attackers — even as it has now hit targets across the border.This is not the first time South Asia’s two largest countries – which have a combined population of more than 1.6 billion, about one-fifth of the world’s population – have gone to war over the region.Indeed, the picturesque valley of Kashmir is at the heart of their tensions.The two neighbours fought three of their four previous wars over Kashmir, spanning 22,200 square kilometres (85,800 square miles). Both countries currently control parts of Kashmir – with China controlling some parts of it – but continue to claim it in full.Since April 22, tensions have escalated, culminating in already limited diplomatic relations taking a further hit.Within Indian-administered Kashmir, authorities have detained more than 2,000 residents, some of them under antiterrorism laws, demolished homes of alleged fighters and imposed strict security measures.The Indian military has dubbed its missile strikes in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir “Operation Sindoor”. That name is significant.Sindoor is the Hindi word for vermilion, a red pigment which married Hindu women often apply to their forehead. The name of India’s military operation is an apparent reference to the manner in which the attackers shot their victims in Pahalgam on April 22.Multiple survivor accounts have detailed how the gunmen segregated male tourists from the women, and then pointedly identified those who were non-Muslim before shooting them dead, leaving their Hindu wives widowed.

269,‘Act of war’: Pakistan pledges retaliation to Indian deadly attacks,"Pakistan has accused India of committing a “blatant act of war” and promised retaliation after New Delhi launched deadly missile attacks along their contested border in disputed Kashmir, in the worst eruption of violence between the nuclear-armed neighbours in two decades.In an address before Pakistan’s parliament on Wednesday, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif denounced as “cowardly” the attack carried out by India, as he repeated Islamabad’s assertion it had nothing to do with the April 22 Pahalgam attack in the Indian-administered Kashmir region.He said Pakistan’s response to the attack, which included the downing of Indian fighter jets, proved that the country was prepared to “knock enemy planes off into the sea”.Before his address, Sharif presided over a National Security Committee meeting, during which Pakistani officials condemned the “illegal acts” of India, describing them as “blatant violations of Pakistan’s sovereignty and territorial integrity”.“The deliberate targeting of civilians, including innocent women and children, by the Indian military constitutes a heinous and shameful crime, that is in violation of all norms of human behaviour and the provisions of international law,” a committee statement said.Earlier, Defence Minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif also declared that Islamabad “won’t take long to settle the score” and said military operations were already under way.India launched a huge military bombardment overnight called “Operation Sindoor”, striking nine sites in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir and killing at least 26 people. In response, Pakistan said it struck Indian military targets and claimed to have shot down several warplanes, resulting in at least 10 deaths.Residents of Muzaffarabad, the capital of Pakistan-administered Kashmir, said they fled their homes and ran into surrounding hills as India launched air attacks on part of the city.“The whole house moved. Everyone got scared, we all evacuated, took our kids and went up [into the hills],” Muhammad Shair Mir, 46, told the Reuters news agency.Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri said on Wednesday that New Delhi carried out the attacks after its intelligence monitoring showed that “further attacks against India were impending.“Therefore, it was necessary to take preemptive and precautionary strikes,” he said, during a joint news conference with top Indian military commanders.The military added that it targeted “terrorist camps” that served as recruitment centres, launchpads, and indoctrination centres, and sites housing weapons and training facilities.The strikes followed an attack on tourists in Pahalgam in Indian-administered Kashmir in March, which New Delhi blamed on Pakistan-backed armed groups.In New Delhi, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has also called an emergency cabinet meeting to discuss the latest deadly exchange, India-based journalist Neha Poonia told Al Jazeera.Poonia also reported that Modi had cancelled his trip to Europe after the fighting broke out.Modi has yet to respond to allegations by Pakistan that he carried out the attacks to “shore up” domestic support.While India insisted that the attacks only targeted armed groups, Pakistan claimed that many of those who were killed and wounded were civilians, including four children.In Punjab, the Pakistani military also claimed that Indian missiles hit a mosque in the city of Bahawalpur, killing a child and wounding two other people.Al Jazeera’s Kamal Hyder, reporting from Islamabad, said that in response to the Indian attacks, Pakistan’s air force has launched retaliatory operations and claimed to have downed Indian military aircraft, including a Sukhoi and MiG jets.“The Pakistani air force said that its jet fighters have not crossed into Indian airspace during the operation, and they said that all its aircraft have returned to base unharmed.”There was no immediate response from the Indian military about the attacks, Hyder said.Meanwhile, our correspondent said funeral rites are set to begin for those killed in the Indian attacks, which hit cities Muzaffarabad and Kotli, both in Pakistan-administered Kashmir.Earlier, Hyder also reported that heavy shelling had resumed on the Line of Control that separates Pakistan-administered Kashmir from Indian-administered Kashmir.“The escalation is something that everyone is watching to see … what Pakistan’s next reaction would be,” he said.In an interview with Al Jazeera, former Pakistani Foreign Minister Hina Rabbani Khar blamed India for the “unprovoked and unsubstantiated” attack against her country, adding that New Delhi is “playing with fire”.Khar said Islamabad has been “warning the world” about India’s “lack of adherence to international law” regarding the situation in Kashmir.“Now it has upped the ante of being the aggressor and operating with impunity,” she said.Diplomats have piled pressure on leaders of both countries to step back.“The world cannot afford a military confrontation between India and Pakistan,” the spokesperson for UN chief Antonio Guterres, Stephane Dujarric, said in a statement.United States President Donald Trump said the clashes were “a shame”.“I just hope it ends very quickly,” Trump said at the White House.China, which shares land borders with both countries and is a close ally of Pakistan, said it expressed “regret over India’s military action this morning” and was “concerned about the current developments”.The United Kingdom is ready to support both India and Pakistan to de-escalate tensions, Trade Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said on Wednesday.",Operation Sindoor,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/7/pakistan-decries-act-of-war-vows-retaliation-as-india-launches-strikes,AL JAZEERA,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""framing"", ""reason"": ""The article frames India's actions as 'deadly attacks' and 'blatant act of war', while Pakistan's response is described as 'retaliation'.

270,How world leaders are reacting to India-Pakistan military attacks,"There has been global consternation in the wake of India launching “Operation Sindoor”, hitting multiple locations in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir that New Delhi alleges are “terrorist” training sites.In response, Islamabad claimed it struck Indian army positions and shot down several warplanes, calling India’s attacks “an act of war”.At least 26 people have been killed overnight in Pakistan and 10 in Indian-administered Kashmir, officials said.This is what global leaders are saying about the escalation in hostilities between the nuclear-armed neighbours:Beijing called for restraint from both sides.“China expresses regret over India’s military actions this morning and is concerned about the current developments. China opposes all forms of terrorism,” the Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson said in a statement.“We call on both India and Pakistan to prioritise peace and stability, remain calm and restrained, and avoid taking actions that further complicate the situation.”France has called on India and Pakistan to show restraint as the worst violence in two decades flared between the two nuclear-armed neighbours.“We understand India’s desire to protect itself against the scourge of terrorism, but we obviously call on both India and Pakistan to exercise restraint to avoid escalation and, of course, to protect civilians,” Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said in an interview on TF1 television.The Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Esmail Baghaei described the military escalation as a serious cause for concern, according to a statement issued by the ministry in Tehran. He expressed the hope that both sides could still de-escalate. Iran also called on both sides to exercise restraint.Israel’s ambassador to India, Reuven Azar, said in a statement that Israel supports India’s right to self-defence. Posting on X, Azar said, “Israel supports India’s right for self defense. Terrorists should know there’s no place to hide from their heinous crimes against the innocent. #OperationSindoor.”Israel supports India’s right for self defense.

Furthermore, we express strong concern that this situation may lead to further retaliatory exchanges and escalate into a full-scale military conflict.“For the peace and stability of South Asia, we strongly urge both India and Pakistan to exercise restraint and stabilise the situation through dialogue,” Chief cabinet secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said.Qatar has said it “follows with great concern the continuing escalation between India and Pakistan” and called for “resolving the crisis through diplomatic channels”.“The Ministry of Foreign Affairs emphasizes the urgent need to keep communication channels open between India and Pakistan,” the statement added.Statement | Qatar follows with deep concern the continuing escalation between India and Pakistan and calls for resolving the crisis through diplomatic means#MOFAQatar pic.twitter.com/DmRAmjOf1v— Ministry of Foreign Affairs – Qatar (@MofaQatar_EN) May 7, 2025Russia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it was deeply concerned about the deepening military confrontation between India and Pakistan and called for both countries to show restraint.In a statement published on the Foreign Ministry’s website, Russia, which has warm relations with both nations, said it condemned all forms of terrorism.Turkey urged India and Pakistan to act with common sense adding that India’s latest military action created the risk of an “all-out war”.In a statement, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs reiterated its support for Pakistan’s call for an investigation into the April 22 attacks.UAE Foreign Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Abdullah bin Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan called on India and Pakistan to show restraint, reduce tensions and prevent further escalation, according to a government statement.“His Highness reaffirmed that diplomacy and dialogue remain the most effective means of peacefully resolving crises, and achieving the shared aspirations of nations for peace, stability, and prosperity,” the statement said.“The Secretary-General is very concerned about the Indian military operations across the Line of Control and international border. He calls for maximum military restraint from both countries,” a spokesperson for Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in a statement.“The world cannot afford a military confrontation between India and Pakistan,” it added.The UK said it was urging India and Pakistan to show restraint and engage in dialogue.“Current tensions between India and Pakistan are a serious concern,” British foreign minister David Lammy said in a statement. “The UK government is urging India and Pakistan to show restraint and engage in direct dialogue to find a swift, diplomatic path forward.”“It’s a shame. Just heard about it. I guess people knew something was going to happen based on a little bit of the past. They’ve been fighting for a long time. They’ve been fighting for many, many decades. I hope it ends very quickly,” President Donald Trump said.Separately, the US administration said it was closely following the military escalation in South Asia.“I am monitoring the situation between India and Pakistan closely.

271,Where did India hit Pakistan? Mapping Operation Sindoor and border strikes,"Just after midnight on Wednesday, India’s army launched Operation Sindoor, hitting nine sites it described as “terrorist infrastructure” in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir.Pakistan’s armed forces said India’s military attacked six different places in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, launching 24 strikes, killing at least eight people and wounding more than 35.The locations targeted in the attacks include:In Pakistan-administered Kashmir, two locations were also hit:Pakistani officials claim their forces have also shot down five Indian warplanes. India did not immediately comment.The Indian Army says Pakistani artillery fire killed at least three people in Indian-administered Kashmir.Located in the northwest of the Indian subcontinent, Kashmir lies at a high altitude, with much of the region rising over 1,500 metres (4,900 feet) above sea level. It covers an area of 222,200 square kilometres (85,800 square miles).The population is overwhelmingly Muslim, with approximately four million people living in Pakistan-administered Kashmir and about 13 million in Indian-administered Jammu and Kashmir.The de facto border that divides Pakistan-administered Kashmir and Indian-administered Kashmir is known as the Line of Control (LoC). The line originally marked the military front when the two countries declared a ceasefire in January 1949 after their first war over Kashmir. It was formally named the LoC under the 1972 Simla Agreement, signed after the 1971 war that resulted in the creation of Bangladesh.India, Pakistan and China each claim parts of Kashmir.Pakistan controls the northern and western portions, namely Gilgit and Baltistan and what Pakistan calls Azad Kashmir or “free Kashmir”. India controls the southern and southeastern parts, including the Kashmir Valley and its biggest city, Srinagar, as well as Jammu and Ladakh.Pakistan calls Indian-administered Kashmir “Indian-occupied Kashmir”. India returns the favour – it calls Pakistan-administered Kashmir “Pakistan-occupied Kashmir”.On April 22, armed men opened fire on a group of tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir, killing 26 men in one of the deadliest attacks on tourists in decades.The attack occurred in the Baisaran meadow, in Pahalgam, a well-known tourist destination located 50km (32 miles) southeast of the regional summer capital, Srinagar.The Resistance Front (TRF), a little-known armed group, which India insists is a proxy for the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba, claimed responsibility for the attack.India has implied it believes Pakistan may have indirectly supported the Pahalgam attack – a claim Pakistan strongly denies.Prior to Wednesday’s attacks, both countries had engaged in tit-for-tat diplomatic swipes at each other, including cancelling visas for each other’s citizens, recalling diplomatic staff and closing airspace to each other’s carriers.",Operation Sindoor,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/7/where-did-india-hit-pakistan-mapping-operation-sindoor-and-border-strikes,AL JAZEERA,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""labeling"", ""reason"": ""Loaded labels/titles applied asymmetrically: 'terrorist infrastructure' vs. no equivalent label for Indian actions."", ""confidence"": 0.8}",no,none,no labelling bias
272,Information war: Are India and Pakistan telling the truth about attacks?,"Competing news briefings. Divergent claims. And conflicting narratives.As Indian attacks on Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir early on May 7 pulled the nuclear-armed neighbours to the brink of a potential military conflict, a parallel war quickly broke out – over information.Within hours of the Indian strikes, authorities on both sides continue to put out claims and counterclaims that have been amplified on social media as each country tries to control the narrative in its favour.Five Indian jets were downed, Pakistan said, for instance. India has yet to respond to the claim but Indian officials who requested anonymity said three jets had crashed in India-administered Kashmir but did not confirm whether they were Indian or Pakistani planes.Here is a look at what both India and Pakistan have claimed so far – and how they have a history of competing narratives that often allow them to each assert wins over the other to their respective domestic audiences while making independent verification of the facts harder.India said its forces hit “terrorist infrastructure” at nine sites in response to last month’s deadly shooting attack on tourists by suspected rebels in Pahalgam in India-administered Kashmir. India blamed Pakistan for the Pahalgam attack, in which 26 male civilians were killed. Islamabad denied the charges and asked India to provide evidence to back up its claims.On Wednesday, Pakistan said Indian forces had hit six cities in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir and a health centre.Pakistan said 31 civilians were killed, including a three-year-old girl.But Indian Defence Minister Rajnath Singh claimed his forces did not harm civilians. In a news briefing, Indian Air Force Wing Commander Vyomika Singh said the strikes led to “no collateral damage” and had been conducted through “precision capability”.Meanwhile, on Thursday, the Indian government claimed that Pakistani attacks on its territory had killed 16 people, including five children.On its official X account, the Pakistani government said Indian soldiers had raised a white flag, a common symbol of surrender, at a military post along the Line of Control (LoC), the de facto border that divides India-administered and Pakistan-administered Kashmir.Pakistan’s Minister for Information and Broadcasting Attaullah Tarar echoed the claim on his X account, posting: “First they fled from the investigation, now they fled from the field.”Indian authorities have yet to formally address the claim, but as India and Pakistan are not officially at war, it is unclear why New Delhi might feel the need to surrender.Pakistan’s military spokesperson, Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, said five Indian jets had been downed, all within Indian territory, with planes from neither side crossing into the other’s airspace.According to Indian security sources who spoke to Al Jazeera, three fighter jets were downed inside India-controlled territory. However, it was not clear which country the warplanes belonged to.While there has been no comment from the federal government, the Indian embassy in China dismissed claims of Indian jets being brought down, criticising a report in the Chinese state media outlet Global Times as “disinformation”.On Thursday, Pakistan’s military spokesperson claimed Pakistan had downed 25 Israeli-made Herop drones using technical equipment and weapons, adding that one civilian had died and four Pakistani soldiers had been wounded.Meanwhile, the Indian Ministry of Defence said Pakistani forces attempted to “engage a number of military targets” in multiple areas in northern and western India using “drones and missiles”.The ministry added that Indian forces struck air defence radars and systems at multiple locations in Pakistan.Neither India nor Pakistan has so far responded to the claims made by the other side.Previous escalations between India and Pakistan have also generated conflicting claims and accusations, often leaving observers to ponder which account, if either, reflects the truth.In February 2019, Indian forces said they had hit a large number of “JeM [Jaish-e-Muhammad] terrorists, trainers, senior commanders and groups of jihadis” in Balakot in Pakistan-administered Kashmir, weeks after a suicide attack killed 40 members of the security forces in India-administered Kashmir’s Pulwama.Formed in 2000, JeM has carried out numerous attacks on Indian forces in India-administered Kashmir. Both India and Pakistan have designated the armed group as a “terrorist organisation”, but its leader Masood Azhar has been allowed to operate in Pakistan. His current whereabouts are unknown.Pakistan, which denied having a role in the Pulwama attack, said the Indian air attacks in 2019 hit an uninhabited forest.Similarly, in 2016, Pakistan rejected India’s claims of “surgical strikes” against “terrorist units” on its territory after an attack on an Indian army base killed 18 soldiers in Uri in India-administered Kashmir.The Pakistani military called the claims an “illusion” and said India had engaged in nothing more than “cross-border fire … which is an existential phenomenon”.Madiha Afzal, a scholar at the Brookings Institution in Washington, DC, said controlling the narrative has been a “fundamental element” on both sides in the 77-year-old conflict between India and Pakistan.That has become more difficult in an age of “easily accessible information as well as social media”, Afzal said. Nevertheless, she added: “If local media largely follows the state’s preferred narratives in both India and Pakistan, which it does, the state can easily control public perception to its advantage and rally public support in its favour.”",Operation Sindoor,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/7/information-war-are-india-or-pakistan-telling-the-truth-about-attacks,AL JAZEERA,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""omission"", ""reason"": ""The article presents multiple conflicting claims from both India and Pakistan without explicitly stating which side's narrative is more credible or accurate.

273,Pakistan launches Operation Bunyan Marsoos: What we know so far,"Islamabad, Pakistan – India and Pakistan fired missiles at each other’s military bases on Saturday morning, the latest escalation in their rapid drift towards an all-out war.Pakistan accused India of carrying out attacks inside its territory for the fourth consecutive night, launching ballistic missile strikes on at least three air bases. Islamabad said that in response, it launched a major military campaign, “Operation Bunyan Marsoos” (Arabic for “a structure made of lead”) targeting at least six Indian military bases.India, in turn, accused Pakistan of being the aggressor. Indian military officials claimed Pakistan had targeted several Indian military bases and that its missiles into Pakistani territory were in response.Yet, regardless of who hit the other first on May 10, the very fact that India and Pakistan had struck each other’s military bases over such a wide swath of territory, well beyond Kashmir – the disputed region that they each partly control – means that the conflict has now veered into almost unknown territory.Never have the South Asian rivals attacked each other on this scale outside the four wars they have fought.Here is what we know so far about India’s attacks, Pakistan’s response, what both countries and global powers like the United States are saying, and the background to this intensifying conflict.Pakistan said that India launched a salvo of drones into Pakistan, followed by ballistic missile strikes on at least three major airbases.The Pakistani bases India targeted are:Pakistan said that in response, it launched aerial attacks against multiple Indian military bases. The bases known to have been targeted are:At a media briefing, Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri accused Pakistan of provocations and escalations, claiming that New Delhi was only responding to its neighbour’s actions.He was joined by Colonel Sofia Qureshi of the Indian Army and Wing Commander Vyomika Singh of the Indian Air Force, who shared New Delhi’s version of events.Pakistan, Qureshi said, used “drones, long-range weapons, loitering munitions and fighter aircrafts to target civilian areas and military infrastructure”.“Pakistan military also resorted to air intrusions using drones and firing of heavy calibre weapons along the Line of Control,” she said. Loitering munitions, also known as suicide drones, are remote-controlled and designed to crash into their targets. The Line of Control is the de facto border between Indian and Pakistani-administered Kashmir.While India said it had shot down most incoming missiles and drones, Qureshi and Singh conceded that the air force bases in Udhampur, Pathankot, Adampur and Bhuj did suffer “limited damage”.India, however, rejected suggestions that any bases had suffered any significant damage, with the military releasing time-stamped photos of the facilities in support of its assertion. Pakistan’s military had on Thursday claimed that the Udhampur and Pathankot bases had been “destroyed.”Indian officials said at least five people had been killed by Pakistani missile fire on Saturday.As the neighbours traded missile fire and allegations, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio spoke with General Syed Asim Munir, Pakistan’s army chief and widely regarded as the country’s most powerful figure, as well as with the Indian foreign minister, S Jaishankar.According to the US State Department, Rubio urged both parties to seek ways to “deescalate” and offered American assistance in launching constructive dialogue to avoid further conflict.Pakistan’s military response on Thursday followed four days of consecutive Indian attacks inside its territory and came two weeks after a deadly assault on tourists in the scenic town of Pahalgam in Indian-administered Kashmir on April 22.The attack killed 26 men, all civilians. India blamed armed groups it alleges are backed by Pakistan, a charge Islamabad has denied, calling instead for an “impartial, transparent” investigation that New Delhi has rejected.Multiple witness accounts suggest the gunmen segregated the men from the women, then selected and killed non-Muslims.India initiated strikes on May 7, targeting areas inside Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir. It claimed to have destroyed “terrorist infrastructure” and eliminated at least “100 terrorists”.It called its attacks Operation Sindoor, a reference to the vermilion – sindoor in Hindi – the red pigment many married Hindu women apply to their foreheads. The mission’s name was an allusion to the manner in which gunmen killed tourists in Pahalgam.Pakistan reported that the Indian strikes killed 33 people, including several children, and injured more than 50. It denied that any of the dead were fighters, as India claimed.As the attacks unfolded, Pakistan deployed its air force in response, engaging in a battle with the Indian Air Force (IAF). Pakistan’s military claimed it downed five Indian jets, including three Rafales, the French-made aircraft considered the IAF’s most advanced assets. India has neither confirmed nor denied the losses.India responded by deploying drones and loitering munitions on May 9 and 10, hitting at least a dozen targets across Pakistan, including major urban centres such as Karachi, Lahore and Rawalpindi.India said the drone strikes were in response to Pakistan’s use of drones, a claim Islamabad continues to reject.“There is no credence to their claims. They continue to lie. Their allegation is false. Otherwise, where is their evidence?” Lieutenant General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, Pakistan’s military spokesperson, told Al Jazeera during a news briefing in Rawalpindi on Friday.He added that Pakistan’s response to “Indian aggression” would come at a “time, method, and place of our choosing”.That time came on the morning of May 10.Pakistan’s operation is titled Bunyan Marsoos, an Arabic phrase that translates as “a structure made of lead”.The phrase originates from the Quran: “Truly God loves those who fight in His cause in battle array, as if they were a solid cemented structure.”In its Quranic context, the phrase symbolises unity and strength among believers fighting for a righteous cause.Experts have repeatedly warned of the need for immediate de-escalation between the nuclear-armed neighbours before the situation becomes “irreversible”.India said on May 10 that it was willing to stop the cycle of escalation if Pakistan reciprocated.But Kamran Bokhari, senior director at the New Lines Institute for Strategy and Policy, said Indian strikes on Pakistani airbases had dramatically escalated the conflict.“With Pindi being hit and other airbases such as the one in Sargodha, the war has taken a turn for the worse,” he told Al Jazeera. “We are now looking at a much bigger-scale war.”Muhammad Faisal, a South Asia security analyst at the University of Technology Sydney, said Pakistan was left with little choice but to respond forcefully.“Pakistan can employ its latest jets in standoff mode or launch long-range missile strikes on Indian airbases that bypass air defences. During the last three days, both sides have significantly mapped each other’s air defences, and now the next round of escalation is here,” he told Al Jazeera.",Operation Sindoor,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/10/pakistan-launches-operation-bunyan-marsoos-what-we-know-so-far,AL JAZEERA,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""framing"", ""reason"": ""The article frames the conflict as a response to Indian aggression, using phrases such as 'India and Pakistan fired missiles at each other's military bases on Saturday morning, the latest escalation in their rapid drift "", ""confidence"": 0.8}",yes,framing,"article frames the conflict as a response to Indian aggression, using phrases such as 'India and Pakistan fired missiles at each other's military bases on Saturday morning, the latest escalation in their rapid drift"
274,India-Pakistan tensions: A brief history of conflict,"India and Pakistan are locked in a rapidly escalating military exchange that threatens to explode into a fully fledged war, triggered by a deadly attack on tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir on April 22 in which 26 civilians were killed, but rooted in decades-old hostilities.On May 7, India launched a wave of missiles into Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, striking at least six cities and killing at least 31 people – including two children – according to Islamabad. Since then, Indian drones have hit major Pakistani cities and military installations, and India has accused Pakistan to launching a barrage of missiles and drones at its cities and military facilities.Alongside the missiles and drones, the nuclear-armed neighbours have also traded allegations and denials. India says its May 7 missiles only struck “terrorist infrastructure” while Pakistan insists civilians were killed. Pakistan denies that it launched missiles or drones towards India, and both claim to be victims of the other’s aggression.Yet the origins of this latest crisis between India and Pakistan go back to their very formation as sovereign nation states in their current form. Here is a recap of the state of near-constant tensions between the South Asian neighbours.The Indian subcontinent was a British colony from 1858 until 1947, when British colonial rule finally ended, splitting the subcontinent into the two countries. The Muslim-majority Pakistan gained its independence on August 14 that year as non-contiguous and culturally distant zones, West Pakistan and East Pakistan. The Hindu-majority but secular India gained its independence on August 15, 1947.The partition was far from smooth, causing one of the largest and bloodiest human migrations ever seen, displacing about 15 million people. The process also sparked horrific communal violence and riots between Muslims, Hindus and Sikhs across the region, in which between 200,000 and two million people died. Border disputes and separatist movements sprang up in the aftermath.What stuck out as a major sticking point between the neighbours was the question of where the Muslim-majority Himalayan region, Kashmir, would go. The monarch of Kashmir initially sought independence and the area remained disputed.In October 1947, the first war over Kashmir broke out when armed Pakistani tribesmen invaded the territory. The monarch of Kashmir asked India for its assistance in driving out the tribesmen. In return, the monarch accepted India’s condition for help – that Kashmir join India.Fighting continued until 1948, when it ended with Kashmir divided. Pakistan administers the western part of Kashmir, while India administers much of the rest, with China holding two thin slices of Kashmir’s north. India claims all of Kashmir, while Pakistan also claims the part that India holds but not what China, its ally, holds.The decade started with a promise of better ties. In 1960, India and Pakistan signed the Indus Waters Treaty, a World Bank-mediated deal under which they agreed to share the waters of the six Indus Basin rivers they both relied – and still rely – on.The treaty gives India access to the waters of the three eastern rivers: the Ravi, Beas and Sutlej. Pakistan, in turn, gets the waters of the three western rivers: the Indus, Jhelum and Chenab. After the April 22 Pahalgam attack, India has suspended its participation in the treaty but until recently, the deal stood as a shining example, internationally, of a water-sharing pact that survived multiple wars.One of those wars would take place in the 1960s.In 1963, the then-foreign minister of India, Swaran Singh and his Pakistani counterpart, Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, held talks over the disputed territory of Kashmir. These talks were mediated by the United States and the United Kingdom.While exact details of the discussions were not made public, no agreement was reached. In 1964, Pakistan referred the Kashmir case to the United Nations.In 1965, the two countries fought the second war over Kashmir after between 26,000 and 33,000 Pakistani soldiers dressed as Kashmiri residents crossed the ceasefire line into Indian-administered Kashmir.As the war escalated, Indian soldiers crossed the international border into Pakistan’s Lahore. The war ended inconclusively, with a ceasefire. In 1966, Indian Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri and Pakistani President Mohammad Ayub Khan signed an agreement in Tashkent, mediated by the Soviet Union, restoring diplomatic and economic relations.In 1971, East Pakistan and West Pakistan went to war after then-president Zulfikar Ali Bhutto refused to let Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the leader of the East Pakistan-based Awami League, assume the premiership. This was despite the fact that the Awami League won the majority of seats in Pakistan’s 1970 parliamentary elections.In March, the Pakistani military began a crackdown in East Pakistan’s Dhaka and in December, the Indian army got involved. The Pakistani army eventually surrendered. East Pakistan became the independent country of Bangladesh.In 1972, Bhutto and Indian PM Indira Gandhi signed an agreement in the Indian town of Simla, called the Simla Agreement where they agreed to settle any disputes by peaceful means.The agreement established the Line of Control (LoC) between the two countries, which neither side is to seek to alter unilaterally, and which “shall be respected by both sides without prejudice to the recognised position of either side”.In 1974, Kashmir’s state government affirmed that it “is a constituent unit of the Union of India,” an accord rejected by Pakistan.In the same year, India detonated a nuclear device in an operation codenamed “Smiling Buddha”. India deemed the device a “peaceful nuclear explosive”.By the early 1980s, Kashmir was back at the centre of India-Pakistan tensions. A separatist movement took root, as popular sentiment started turning against the elected government of Indian-administered Kashmir, which many locals felt was betraying their interests in exchange for close ties with New Delhi.A tipping point was the 1987 election to the state legislature, which saw the National Conference, a party committed to the Indian Constitution, win amid widespread allegations of heavy rigging to keep out popular, anti-India politicians.By 1989, a full-blown armed resistance against India had taken shape in Indian-administered Kashmir, seeking secession from India.New Delhi has consistently accused Islamabad of financing, training and sheltering these armed groups, who India describes as “terrorists”. Pakistan has insisted that it only offers “moral and diplomatic” support to the separatist movement, though many of those groups have bases and headquarters in Pakistan.In 1991, both countries signed agreements on providing advance notification of military exercises, manoeuvres and troop movements, as well as on preventing airspace violations and establishing overflight rules.In 1992, they signed a joint declaration banning the use of chemical weapons.In 1996, after a series of clashes, military officers from the countries met at the LoC in order to ease tensions.In 1998, India detonated five nuclear devices. Pakistan responded by detonating six nuclear devices of its own. Both were slapped with sanctions by many nations – but they had become nuclear-armed states.In the same year, both countries tested long-range missiles.In 1999, Indian PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee met with Pakistani PM Nawaz Sharif in Lahore. The two signed an agreement called the Lahore Declaration, reaffirming their commitment to the Simla Accord, and agreeing to undertake a number of “confidence building measures” (CBMs).However, later in the same year, the Pakistani military crossed the LoC, seizing Indian military posts in the Kargil mountains, sparking the Kargil War. Indian troops pushed the Pakistani soldiers back after bloody battles in the snowy heights of the Ladakh region.Tensions across the LoC remained high throughout the 2000s.In December 2001, an armed attack on the Indian parliament in New Delhi killed 14 people. India blamed Pakistan-backed armed groups for the attacks, that led to a face-to-face standoff between Indian and Pakistan militaries along the LoC. That standoff only ended in October 2002, after international mediation.In 2002, Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf, amid Western pressure following the 9/11 attacks, pledged that Pakistan would combat extremism on its own soil, but affirmed that the country had a right to Kashmir.In 2003, during a UN General Assembly meeting, Musharraf called for a ceasefire along the LoC, and India and Pakistan came to an agreement to cool tensions and cease hostilities. In 2004, Musharraf held talks with Indian PM Vajpayee.But in 2007, the Samjhauta Express, the train service linking India and Pakistan, was bombed near Panipat, north of New Delhi. Sixty-eight people were killed, and dozens injured. Hindu extremists were charged by the Indian government at the time, but have subsequently been set free.In 2008, trade relations began to improve across the LoC and India joined a framework agreement between Turkmenistan, Afghanistan and Pakistan on a $7.6bn gas pipeline project.However, in November 2008, armed gunmen opened fire on civilians at several sites in Mumbai, India. More than 160 people were killed in the attacks.Ajmal Kasab, the only attacker captured alive, said the attackers were members of Lashkar-e-Taiba. Kasab was executed by India in 2012. India blamed Pakistani intelligence agencies for the attacks.In 2009, the Pakistani government conceded that the Mumbai attacks may have been partly planned on Pakistani soil, but denied that the plotters were sanctioned or aided by Pakistan’s intelligence agencies.In 2014, Pakistan’s then army chief General Raheel Sharif called Kashmir the “jugular vein” of Pakistan, and that the dispute should be resolved in accordance with the wishes and aspirations of Kashmiris and in line with UN resolutions.In 2016, armed fighters killed 17 Indian soldiers in Uri, Indian-administered Kashmir. As a response, India carried out what it described as “surgical strikes” against bases of armed groups across the LoC.In 2019, a suicide bomber killed 40 Indian paramilitary soldiers in Pulwama in Indian-administered Kashmir. Jaish-e-Muhammad claimed the attack.In the aftermath, the Indian Air Force launched an aerial raid on Balakot in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province, claiming it targeted terrorist hideouts and killed several dozen fighters. Pakistan insisted that Indian jets only hit a forested region and did not kill any fighters.Later in 2019, India revoked Article 370, which granted Kashmir a special, semi-autonomous status and began a crackdown that saw thousands of Kashmiri civilians and politicians arrested, many under anti-terror laws that rights groups have described as draconian.On April 22 this year, an armed attack on tourists in Pahalgam, in Indian-administered Kashmir, killed 26 men.An armed group called The Resistance Front (TRF), which demands independence for Kashmir, claimed responsibility for the attack. India alleged that TRF was an offshoot of the Pakistan-based LeT. Islamabad denied allegations of its involvement in the attack and called for a neutral investigation.On May 7, India launched Operation Sindoor, carrying out missile strikes on multiple targets in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir.

275,India and Pakistan agree ceasefire: What does it mean?,"India and Pakistan have reached a ceasefire agreement following a brief period of hostilities over the past few days, United States President Donald Trump announced on Saturday.Earlier on Saturday, the two neighbours targeted each other’s military sites as Pakistan launched “Operation Bunyan Marsoos” after three of its own airbases were hit by India’s air-to-surface missiles. Both sides claimed to have intercepted most projectiles, but also admitted that some strikes caused damage.More than 60 people have been reported killed since India launched missiles under “Operation Sindoor” on Wednesday, which it said targeted “terrorist camps” in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir. Pakistan has confirmed the killing of 13 people on its side of the Line of Control (LoC), the de facto border between the two countries dividing the disputed Kashmir region.The strikes had raised fears of a wider conflict between the two nuclear-armed neighbours. While international mediation has resolved disputes between India and Pakistan before, it remains to be seen if this ceasefire will hold and whether people will be able to relax.“After a long night of talks mediated by the United States, I am pleased to announce that India and Pakistan have agreed to a full and immediate ceasefire,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform on Saturday.“Congratulations to both Countries on using Common Sense and Great Intelligence. Thank you for your attention to this matter!” Multiple countries are understood to have been involved in these talks.Pakistan’s Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar and Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri confirmed the ceasefire shortly after.“It was agreed between them that both sides would stop all fighting and military action on land, air and sea with effect from 17:00 Indian Standard Time today [11:30 GMT],” Misri said in a short statement.“Instructions have been given on both sides to give effect to this understanding. The directors general of military operations will talk again on May 12 at 12:00.”India and Pakistan have also activated military channels and hotlines following the deal, according to Dar.US Secretary of State Marco Rubio also said India and Pakistan had agreed to start talks on a “broad set of issues at a neutral site”.However, in a statement on social media, India’s Ministry of Information and Broadcasting partially denied this, stating: “There is no decision to hold talks on any other issue at any other place.”Subir Sinha, director of the South Asian Institute at SOAS University of London, told Al Jazeera that broader bilateral talks would be a very challenging process as India had previously rejected such a development.“One of the arguments about this so-called robust policy towards Pakistan that Modi’s government had adopted was that it was no longer possible to sit down and discuss a broad and long-term commitment to resolve issues,” Sinha said.Therefore, this would mark a reversal of the Indian government’s position and could play out poorly with the right wing in India, whose members have been calling for an attack on Pakistan.Sinha said both the Indus Waters Treaty, which India suspended its participation of and the Simla Agreement, which Pakistan threatened to pull out of, will need to be fully resumed and “to be looked [at] perhaps as bases for moving forward”.Officially, no. Despite intense military exchanges, including missile strikes, drone attacks, and artillery shelling, neither government made an official declaration of war.India and Pakistan instead characterised their military actions as specific coordinated “military operations”.Pakistan on Saturday launched a retaliatory assault it named “Bunyan Marsoos”, Arabic for “Wall of Lead”, just days after India initiated “Operation Sindoor“, responding to a deadly attack on tourists in Pahalgam on April 22, which it blamed on Pakistan-based armed groups.However, that is not unusual for these two countries. They have not officially declared war in previous major conflicts, even as thousands of soldiers and civilians died.Yes. Third-party mediation has resolved disputes since 1947, when the subcontinent split through partition and India and Pakistan fought their first war. After a yearlong war over ownership of the princely state of Jammu and Kashmir, a United Nations-brokered ceasefire effectively split Kashmir between Indian- and Pakistan-administered regions in 1948.The 1965 Indo-Pakistani War ended with the Tashkent Declaration in January 1966, following mediation by the erstwhile Soviet Union. The accord saw Indian Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri and Pakistani President Ayub Khan agree to pull back to pre-war positions and restore diplomatic and economic ties.During the 1999 Kargil War, Pakistani troops crossed the LoC and seized Indian positions. Then-US President Bill Clinton convinced Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to withdraw, warning of international isolation.In 2002, then-US Secretary of State Colin Powell claimed he and his team had mediated the end of a tense stand-off along the LoC following an attack on the Indian Parliament in December 2001. The following June, Powell said that through negotiations, he had received assurances from President Pervez Musharraf of Pakistan that “infiltration activity” across the LoC would cease and that armed groups would be dismantled on Pakistani territory.There is no single definition. International humanitarian law, such as the Geneva Conventions, uses the term “international armed conflict” instead of “war”, defining it more broadly as any use of armed forces between states, regardless of whether either side calls it a “war”.In modern international law, all uses of force are categorised as “armed conflict” regardless of justifications such as self-defence, according to Ahmer Bilal Soofi, an advocate in the Supreme Court of Pakistan who also specialises in international law.The suspension of a treaty can also signal the start of war, he added. India suspended its participation in the landmark Indus Waters Treaty with Pakistan on April 23, a move Pakistan described as a “hostile act”.“Political scientists normally say a war only exists after fighting becomes quite intense – normally 1,000 battle deaths,” said Christopher Clary, assistant professor of political science at the University at Albany. “For governments, though, wars exist whenever they say so.”Experts argue the recent escalation in military actions by India and Pakistan was as much about signalling strength as they were about military objectives, and was also part of a broader effort to manage domestic and international perception.Sean Bell, a United Kingdom-based military analyst, said much of the current rhetoric from both India and Pakistan is deliberately aimed at domestic audiences. Each side is “trying to make clear to their own populations that there is a robust military response, and that they’re retaliating for any actions”, he told Al Jazeera. But this tit-for-tat dynamic, Bell warned, risks becoming difficult to stop once it starts.Following the adoption of the UN Charter in 1945, “no country claims ‘war’ or declares ‘war’ as, legally speaking, it is viewed as unlawful use of force”, Soofi told Al Jazeera.Officially, being in a state of armed conflict triggers international legal obligations, such as following the rules of armed conflict and being accountable for war crimes.In the latest India-Pakistan standoff, both sides portrayed the other as the aggressor, insisting it should be the one to de-escalate.The absence of a formal, universally accepted definition of war means countries can engage in sustained military operations without ever officially declaring war. Ambiguity also allows governments to frame military actions in ways that suit their political or diplomatic goals.For example, Russia has consistently described its 2022 invasion of Ukraine as a “special military operation”, despite large-scale troop deployments, air strikes and territorial occupation. Similarly, the US referred to the Korean War in the 1950s as a “police action” and framed its long-term activities in Afghanistan and Iraq as “counterterrorism operations”. Israel also often uses terms like “military campaign” or “operation” for cross-border offensives, such as “Operation Protective Edge” during its 2014 war in Gaza.",Operation Sindoor,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/10/india-and-pakistan-agree-ceasefire-what-does-it-mean,AL JAZEERA,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""framing"", ""reason"": ""The article frames the military actions of India and Pakistan as 'hostilities' and 'military operations', downplaying the severity of the situation.

276,Why did India lose jets to Pakistani fire in May fight?,"An Indian naval officer has conceded that the country lost fighter jets to Pakistani fire during their conflict in May and says the losses were a result of “constraints” placed on Indian forces by the government in New Delhi.Captain Shiv Kumar, defence attache at the Indian embassy in Jakarta, made the comments at a seminar in Indonesia on June 10. The remarks went largely unnoticed at the time until The Wire, an Indian publication, reported on them on Sunday.Kumar’s claims have sparked a political storm in India, where the opposition Indian National Congress party called them an “indictment” of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government.So what did Kumar say, how have the Indian government and opposition responded, and what happened between India and Pakistan on May 7?Tensions between India and Pakistan escalated into a military confrontation on May 7 when India launched Operation Sindoor, targeting nine sites in six cities in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir with multiple missile attacks.India said it hit “terrorist infrastructure” in response to the killings of tourists on April 22 in Pahalgam in India-administered Kashmir. Pakistan, on the other hand, said dozens of civilians were killed in the missile attacks along with several military personnel.Islamabad said it downed six Indian jets in retaliation, including at least three Rafale fighters. Pakistan military spokesperson Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry said all the planes were downed inside Indian territory. An information war also ensued, in which India and Pakistan traded conflicting allegations and claims, but they both agreed on one fact: Aircraft from neither side crossed into the other’s territory during the attacks.In subsequent days, the nuclear-armed South Asian neighbours exchanged tit-for-tat missile strikes and drone attacks on each other’s territory until a ceasefire was reached on May 10. It was announced by United States President Donald Trump, who insisted he brokered it – a claim New Delhi rejects. India insisted all its disputes with Pakistan must be settled bilaterally and there is no room for third-party involvement.During the seminar organised by Air Marshal Suryadarma University in Indonesia, Kumar said he “may not agree [with an earlier Indonesian speaker’s claim] that we lost so many aircraft, but I do agree we did lose some aircraft”.Kumar added: “That happened only because of the constraints given by the political leadership to not attack the military establishment or their air defence” on May 7.The naval attache said the Indian military subsequently changed tactics and began to target Pakistani military installations.“We first achieved suppression of enemy air defences, and then that’s why all our attacks could easily go through using Brahmos missiles,” Kumar added.The Brahmos, a product of an Indian-Russian joint venture, is a long-range missile. Indian media reported that India fired Brahmos missiles at  Pakistani airbases on the night of May 9-10.After Pakistan first said it had shot down six Indian jets on May 7, New Delhi did not officially confirm or deny those assertions.When Chinese state news outlet The Global Times reported that Pakistan had brought down the Indian fighters, the Indian embassy in China described it as “disinformation”.But subsequently, Indian officials started to suggest that they had lost planes.When asked by reporters on May 11 whether Pakistan had managed to down Indian jets, Indian Director General of Air Operations AK Bharti said: “We are in a combat scenario, and losses are a part of it. As for details, at this time, I would not like to comment on that as we are still in combat and give advantage to the adversary. All our pilots are back home.”Then, General Anil Chauhan, India’s chief of defence staff admitted that Indian jets were downed by Pakistan, without specifying the number of jets, during interviews on the sidelines of the Shangri-La Dialogue security forum in Singapore, which took place May 30 to June 1.Chauhan’s acknowledgement, made during interviews with the Reuters news agency and Bloomberg TV, marked the first time an Indian official admitted that Indian jets were shot down. “What was important is why did these losses occur and what we’ll do after that,” Chauhan said.When a Bloomberg reporter asked Chauhan about Pakistan’s claims that six Indian jets were downed, Chauhan responded that this information was incorrect. He added that “what is important is … not the jets being downed but why they were downed”.Chauhan said India “rectified tactics” after the May 7 losses and then “hit airbases deep inside Pakistan, penetrated all their air defences with impunity, carried out precision strikes” before the May 10 ceasefire.In a statement posted on its X account on Sunday, the Indian embassy in Indonesia said: “[Kumar’s] remarks have been quoted out of context and the media reports are a mis-representation of the intention and thrust of the presentation made by the speaker.”The embassy said that in the presentation, Kumar explained that Operation Sindoor was launched to target “terrorist infrastructure” and the attache was trying to emphasise that the Indian response was deliberately not escalatory.“The presentation conveyed that the Indian Armed Forces serve under civilian political leadership unlike some other countries in our neighbourhood,” it added in a barb at Pakistan, where the military is the most dominant institution.We have seen media reports regarding a presentation made by the Defence Attache at a Seminar.His remarks have been quoted out of context and the media reports are a mis-representation of the intention and thrust of the presentation made by the speaker.The presentation…— India in Indonesia (@IndianEmbJkt) June 29, 2025Not really. While neither the Indian government nor the military has ever bluntly linked the loss of jets to the Modi administration’s orders to the armed forces on May 7, New Delhi has been consistent in its narrative over its objectives that day.In a media statement after India launched missiles on May 7, Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri said the actions of India’s military “were measured, nonescalatory, proportionate and responsible”.Colonel Sofia Qureshi of the Indian army, who accompanied Misri to the briefing, emphasised that “no military establishments were targeted”.After the ceasefire, Indian Foreign Minister S Jaishankar told reporters that before firing at Pakistan on May 7, New Delhi had “sent a message to Pakistan that we are firing at terrorist infrastructure, we are not striking at the military, so the [Pakistani] military has the option of standing out and not interfering in this process”.“They chose not to take that good advice,” Jaishankar said.The Indian government argued that the Pakistani military’s response to New Delhi’s May 7 attack forced it to also retaliate, culminating in the missile exchanges on May 10.The main opposition Congress party has been asking Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party government to inform parliament about India’s air losses during the conflict.When Chauhan admitted Indian planes were downed, Congress members demanded a review of India’s defence preparedness.“There are some very important questions which need to be asked,” Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge wrote in an X post at the time. “These can only be asked if a Special Session of the Parliament is immediately convened.”Kumar’s remarks have revived those calls.“The Modi government has misled the nation from the start – failing to disclose the aircraft losses during Operation Sindoor,” Congress leader Pawan Khera wrote on X on Sunday, calling the comments by Kumar an “indictment” of the government.“No wonder they are ducking our demand for a Special Session of Parliament like the plague. They know they’ve compromised national security, and they’re terrified of what the Congress Party will expose before the people of India,” Khera wrote.Another Congress leader, Jairam Ramesh, posted on X on Sunday: “Why is the PM refusing to preside over an all-party meeting and take the Opposition into confidence? Why has the demand for a special session of Parliament been rejected?”On April 22, a group of armed men killed 26 people – almost all of them tourists – in Pahalgam, a popular tourist destination in India-administered Kashmir. An armed group called The Resistance Front (TRF) claimed responsibility for the attack.New Delhi insisted that the TRF is an offshoot of another Pakistan-based armed group, Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), and has blamed Pakistan for supporting such groups. Islamabad denied the allegation and called for a neutral inquiry into the attack.After the Pahalgam attack, the already dwindling relationship between the neighbours worsened. Pakistan and India scaled back their diplomatic engagement, suspended their participation in bilateral treaties and expelled each other’s citizens.",Operation Sindoor,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/6/30/political-limits-why-did-india-lose-jets-to-pakistani-fire-in-may-fight,AL JAZEERA,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""labeling"", ""reason"": ""The article labels the Indian government's actions as 'non-escalatory' and 'proportionate', while also implying that Pakistan's response was unjustified.

277,Did Pakistan shoot down five Indian fighter jets? What we know,"Four days after India and Pakistan reached a ceasefire after a rapid escalation in a military conflict between them, key differences between their battlefield claims remain unresolved.Among them is Pakistan’s assertion that it shot down five Indian fighter jets on May 7, the first day of fighting, in response to Indian attacks on its territory.As a battle of narratives takes over from the actual fighting, Al Jazeera takes stock of what we know about that claim, and why, if true, it matters.Tensions between India and Pakistan erupted into military confrontation on May 7 after India bombed nine sites across six cities in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir.India said it had struck what it called “terrorist infrastructure” in response to the deadly April 22 killings of tourists by suspected rebels in India-administered Kashmir.Gunmen on April 22 shot dead 25 male tourists and a local pony rider in the picturesque meadows of Pahalgam, triggering outrage and calls for revenge in India. New Delhi blamed Pakistan for supporting the fighters responsible for the attack, a charge Islamabad denied.Pakistan said Indian forces on May 7 struck two cities in Pakistan-administered Kashmir and four sites in the country’s largest province, Punjab. It said civilians were killed in the attacks. India’s Defence Minister Rajnath Singh rejected the Pakistani claims, reiterating that Indian forces “struck only those who harmed our innocents”.Over the next four days, the two nuclear-armed neighbours were engaged in tit-for-tat strikes on each other’s airbases, while unleashing drones into each other’s territories.Amid fears of a nuclear exchange, top officials from the United States made calls to Indian and Pakistani officials to end the conflict.On May 10, US President Donald Trump announced that Washington had successfully mediated a ceasefire between the nuclear-armed neighbours. Despite initial accusations of violations by both sides, the ceasefire has continued to hold so far.Pakistan reported on Tuesday that Indian strikes killed at least 51 people, including 11 soldiers and several children, while India has said at least five military personnel and 16 civilians died.Speaking to Al Jazeera shortly after the May 7 attacks, Pakistan’s Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said Islamabad, in retaliation, had shot down five Indian jets, a drone, and many quadcopters.Later in the day, Pakistan’s military spokesperson Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry said the warplanes had all been downed inside Indian territory, and aircraft from neither side crossed into the other’s territory during the attacks – an assertion India seconded.“Neither India nor Pakistan had any need to send their own aircraft out of their own national airspace,” British defence analyst Michael Clarke told Al Jazeera.“Their standoff weapons all had long enough ranges to reach their evident targets whilst flying in their own airspace,” Clarke, who is a visiting professor in the Department of War Studies at King’s College, London, added.On Friday, Pakistan’s Air Vice Marshal Aurangzeb Ahmed claimed that among the five downed aircraft were three Rafales, a MiG-29, and an Su-30, providing electronic signatures of the aircraft, in addition to the exact locations where the planes were hit.The battle between Pakistani and Indian jets lasted for just over an hour, Ahmed, who is also the deputy chief of operations, told reporters.He stated that the confrontation featured at least 60 Indian aircraft, among them 14 French-made Rafales, while Pakistan deployed 42 “hi-tech aircraft,” including American F-16s and Chinese JF-17s and J-10s.After Chinese state news outlet The Global Times wrote that Pakistan had brought down Indian fighter planes, India’s embassy in China described the report as “disinformation”.However, beyond that, New Delhi has not formally confirmed or denied the reports.Asked specifically whether Pakistan had managed to down Indian jets, India’s Director General of Air Operations AK Bharti avoided a direct answer.“We are in a combat scenario and losses are a part of it,” he said. “As for details, at this time I would not like to comment on that as we are still in combat and give advantage to the adversary. All our pilots are back home.”Beyond the official accounts, local and international media outlets have reported different versions of Pakistan’s claims of downing the jets.According to Indian security sources who spoke to Al Jazeera, three fighter jets crashed inside India-controlled territory.They did not confirm which country the warplanes belonged to. However, with neither side suggesting that Pakistani planes crossed into Indian airspace, any debris in Indian-controlled territory likely comes from an Indian plane.Reuters news agency also reported, citing four government sources in Indian-administered Kashmir, that three fighter jets crashed in the region. Reports in CNN said that at least two jets crashed, while a French source told the US outlet that at least one Rafale jet had been shot down.Photos taken by AP news agency photo journalists showed debris of an aircraft in the Pulwama district in Indian-administered Kashmir.Defence analyst Clarke said if India has indeed lost a Rafale, that would certainly be “embarrassing”.“If it came down inside Indian territory, which must be the case if one was destroyed, then India will want to keep it only as a rumour for as long as possible,” he added.“India has said that “losses” are inevitable, and that is probably as near as they will get to admitting a specific aircraft loss for a while.”",Operation Sindoor,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/14/did-pakistan-shoot-down-five-indian-fighter-jets-what-we-know,AL JAZEERA,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""omission"", ""reason"": ""The article presents multiple sources and perspectives on the claim that Pakistan shot down five Indian fighter jets, but fails to provide a clear conclusion or fact-checking of these claims.

278,What are India and Pakistan’s military and nuclear capabilities?,"On Wednesday morning, India carried out multiple missile attacks on parts of Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, in which at least 26 people were killed, including a three-year-old child.India has claimed its Operation Sindoor targeted nine sites with “terrorist infrastructure”.In response, Pakistan has claimed it has brought down five Indian planes – but India has not commented on this claim. At least 10 civilians have been killed in Indian-administered Kashmir due to Pakistani fire since Wednesday morning, according to local officials.Al Jazeera visualises what has happened so far and the military capabilities of both countries.On Wednesday morning, Pakistan’s armed forces said Indian missiles struck six locations, including four places in Punjab province – the first time that India has hit Pakistan’s most populous state since the 1971 war between the neighbours.The remaining two places targeted were Muzaffarabad and Kotli, both in Pakistan-administered Kashmir.India claims that it also struck a seventh location – Bhimber, also located in Pakistan-administered Kashmir.The attacks are India’s response to a deadly attack on tourists on April 22, in which gunmen killed 25 tourists and a local pony rider in the scenic town of Pahalgam, in Indian-administered Kashmir. According to multiple witness accounts, the attackers separated the men from the women and tried to pick non-Muslims as their targets. The gunmen subsequently escaped, and Indian security forces are yet to find them 16 days later.In 1947, the British colonial rulers drew a line of partition, dividing the Indian subcontinent into Muslim-majority Pakistan and Hindu-majority India. What followed was one of the largest – and, perhaps, bloodiest – migrations in human history.Seventy-eight years on, the two nations remain bitter foes. But now they have nuclear arms.The tension between India and Pakistan has escalated sharply once again after the Pahalgam attack.The Muslim-majority Kashmir region, a former princely state, has been in dispute since the partition of India. India, Pakistan and China each control a part of Kashmir. India claims all of it, while Pakistan claims the part administered by India.The two countries have gone to war four times, and there have been numerous cross-border skirmishes and escalations, including one in 2019 after at least 40 Indian soldiers were killed in a suicide attack claimed by the Pakistan-based armed group, Jaish-e-Muhammad.In retaliation, India launched air strikes in Balakot, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa later that month, claiming that its jets had struck “terrorist” bases, killing many fighters. Many independent analysts have questioned whether India actually struck bases of armed groups and whether it killed as many fighters as it claims it did.According to Global Firepower’s 2025 military strength rankings, India is the fourth-strongest military power in the world, and Pakistan is ranked as the 12th strongest.India is the fifth-largest spender in the world on military. In 2024, it spent $86bn on its military, or 2.3 percent of its gross domestic product (GDP), according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), a leading defence and armaments think tank.In comparison, Pakistan spent $10.2bn, or 2.7 percent of its GDP, on the military in 2024.India’s total military strength is 5,137,550 personnel, which is almost three times larger than Pakistan’s 1,704,000. Neither country has mandatory conscription.India possesses 2,229 military aircraft, compared with Pakistan’s 1,399.India has 3,151 combat tanks, compared with Pakistan’s 1,839.Pakistan’s navy covers its 1,046 kilometre-long (650-mile) southern coastal borders in the Arabian Sea and possesses 121 naval assets, while India’s mainland coast covers nearly 6,100km (3,800 miles) with 293 naval assets.According to the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICANW), a global coalition to ban nuclear weapons, in 2023, countries spent an estimated $91.4bn on nuclear weapons, with India spending $2.7bn and Pakistan $1bn.India carried out its first nuclear test in May 1974, and in May 1998, conducted another five tests, declaring itself a nuclear weapons state.Pakistan carried out its first nuclear tests shortly after India’s in 1998, officially becoming a nuclear weapons state.Since then, the two born together, star-crossed nations have been engaged in an arms race that has cost them billions of dollars.According to the Center for Strategic and International Studies’ (CSIS) Missile Defence Project, New Delhi nuclear deterrents are mainly aimed at rivals Pakistan and China. India has developed longer range missiles and mobile land-based missiles. In conjunction with Russia, it is in the developing stages for ship and submarine missiles.The CSIS also states that Pakistan’s arsenal consists primarily of mobile short- and medium-range ballistic missiles, which have enough of a range to target India. China’s significant technical assistance on its nuclear and missile programmes has helped Pakistan in recent years.According to SIPRI, the cross-border tensions between the two nations fuel arms imports by both countries.India was the second-largest arms importer from 2020-2024, after Ukraine, bearing an 8.3 percent share of global imports. The majority of India’s imports come from Russia, although it has been shifting its arms sourcing to France, Israel and the United States.Across the border, Pakistan’s arms and weapons imports increased by 61 percent between 2015–19 and 2020–24 as it started to receive deliveries, including combat aircraft and warships. On a global scale, Pakistan is the fifth-largest arms importer with 4.6 percent imports in 2020–24.Since 1990, Pakistan’s main supplier has been China. China supplied 81 percent of Pakistan’s arms imports in 2020–24; Russia supplied 36 percent of India’s arms during the same period.",Operation Sindoor,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/8/what-are-india-and-pakistans-military-and-nuclear-capabilities,AL JAZEERA,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""framing"", ""reason"": ""The article frames the conflict between India and Pakistan as a response to terrorism, with India's Operation Sindoor targeting 'terrorist infrastructure'.

279,Are India and Pakistan preparing for a naval face-off in a future conflict?,"Islamabad, Pakistan – When Indian Minister of Defence Rajnath Singh visited the Indian Navy’s aircraft carrier INS Vikrant on May 30, nearly three weeks after a ceasefire was announced with Pakistan after a four-day conflict, he had stern words for Islamabad.Wearing an Indian Navy baseball cap, with his initial “R” emblazoned on it, Singh declared that Pakistan was fortunate the Indian Navy had not been called upon during the recent hostilities.“Despite remaining silent, the Indian Navy succeeded in tying down the Pakistani Army. Just imagine what will happen when someone who can keep a country’s army locked in a bottle, even by remaining silent, speaks up?” Singh said, standing in front of a Russian-made MiG-29 fighter jet on the deck of the 262-metre-long (860 feet) ship.Just two days later, on June 1, the Pakistan Navy issued a pointed response. In a message posted on X, it announced a two-day exercise, “focusing on countering sub-conventional and asymmetric threats across all major ports and harbours of Pakistan”.PN conducted 2-day Ex focusing on countering sub-conventional & asymmetric threats across all major ports & harbours of Pak, aimed at validating & refining Tactics, Techniques & Procedures to ensure robust defence of critical maritime infrastructure against asymmetric threats.1/3 pic.twitter.com/R1IsajwyBB— DGPR (Navy) (@dgprPaknavy) June 1, 2025These symbolic shows of strength followed India’s “Operation Sindoor” and Pakistan’s “Operation Bunyan Marsoos“, the countries’ respective codenames for the four-day conflict that ended in a ceasefire on May 10.The standoff was triggered by an April 22 attack in Pahalgam, in Indian-administered Kashmir, in which 26 civilians, almost all tourists, were killed. India blamed armed groups allegedly backed by Pakistan, a charge Islamabad denied.On May 7, India launched missile strikes at multiple sites in Pakistan’s Punjab province and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, killing at least 51 people, including 11 soldiers and several children. Over the next three days, the two countries exchanged artillery and air power, hitting each other’s airbases.The 96 hours of conflict brought 1.6 billion people to the brink of war. But while the navies largely remained passive observers, they monitored each other’s movements – and were ready for action.Satellite imagery showed that the INS Vikrant moved towards Pakistan soon after the Pahalgam attack and remained deployed for four days in the Arabian Sea before returning to its base in Karnataka.Pakistan also mobilised its fleet, which was bolstered by the docking of a Turkish naval ship in Karachi on May 2. According to the Pakistani Navy, Turkish personnel engaged in “a series of professional interactions” with their counterparts.Now, even amid the current pause in military tensions, analysts say Singh’s remarks and Pakistan’s naval drills highlight the growing part that maritime forces could play in the next chapter of their conflict. This is a role the Indian and Pakistani navies are well-versed in.After independence from Britain in August 1947, India inherited two-thirds of British India’s naval assets.These saw no use during the first India-Pakistan war in 1947, over the contested Himalayan region of Kashmir. India and Pakistan both administer parts of Kashmir, along with China, which governs two thin strips. India claims all of Kashmir, while Pakistan claims all the parts not controlled by China, its ally.By the 1965 war, also over Kashmir, Pakistan had expanded its fleet with aid from the United States and United Kingdom, its Cold War allies. It had acquired Ghazi, a long-range submarine, giving it an edge over India, which lacked a submarine at the time, though it owned an aircraft carrier. Pakistan, to date, does not have an aircraft carrier.While the land war started on September 6, the Pakistan Navy joined the conflict on the night of September 7-8. A fleet of seven warships and submarine PNS Ghazi left Karachi harbour and made their way towards the Indian naval base of Dwarka in the western state of Gujarat, roughly 350km (217 miles) away.They were tasked with carrying out the “bombardment of Dwarka about midnight using 50 rounds per ship”, according to the Pakistan Navy’s official account, targeting the base’s radar and other installations.The selection of Dwarka was significant from a historical and strategic perspective. The city is home to one of the most sacred sites for Hindus, the Somnath Temple, on which the Pakistan Navy named its operation.Militarily, the radar installations in Dwarka were used to provide guidance to the Indian Air Force. Knocking them out would have made it harder for India to launch aerial attacks against Pakistani cities, especially Karachi. That, in turn, would have forced India to send out its warships from the nearby port of Bombay (now Mumbai) – and PNS Ghazi, the submarine, could have ambushed them.But the Pakistani plan only partly worked. Many Indian warships were under maintenance, and so the Indian Navy did not send them out to chase the Pakistani fleet.According to the Pakistan Navy’s accounts, after firing about 350 rounds, the operation ended in “four minutes” and all its ships returned safely.Syed Muhammad Obaidullah, a former commodore in the Pakistan Navy, recalled the attack.“We were able to send eight vessels, seven ships and a submarine – that surprised the Indians, as our ships targeted the radar station used to assist Indian planes,” Obaidullah told Al Jazeera.Muhammad Shareh Qazi, a Lahore-based maritime security expert, added that the operation was a tactical surprise, but did not lead to any gains in territory or of the maritime continental shelf.“All our ships returned safely, without resistance, but it was only an operational-level success for the PN, not a strategic one,” he said, referring to the Pakistan Navy.Official Indian Navy records claim that most of the shells fired by Pakistani ships caused no damage and remained unexploded.Anjali Ghosh, a professor of international relations at Jadavpur University, Kolkata, in her book India’s Foreign Policy, described the attack as “daring” but symbolic rather than strategically meaningful.The 1971 war, fought over East Pakistan’s secession to become Bangladesh, saw more substantial naval engagements.India launched two operations – Trident and Python – which dealt major blows to Pakistan’s Navy, sinking several ships, including the destroyer PNS Khaibar and minesweeper PNS Muhafiz, and destroying fuel tanks at Karachi Harbour.Uday Bhaskar, a former commodore in the Indian Navy, said the navy played a pivotal role in India’s 1971 victory.“The naval role enabled the final outcome on land,” Bhaskar, the current director of the Society for Policy Studies, an independent think tank based in New Delhi, told Al Jazeera.Pakistan also suffered the loss of its prized submarine Ghazi, which sank while laying mines near Visakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh, home to India’s Eastern Naval Command.The one major victory for the Pakistani Navy was its torpedoing of the Indian frigate INS Khukri using its submarine Hangor, which killed more than 170 Indian sailors.Qazi, who is also an assistant professor at Lahore’s Punjab University, said that the Indian Navy replicated the Pakistani playbook from the 1965 war in the way it surprised the Pakistan Navy.“India caused a heavy blow to Pakistan and our naval capabilities were severely dented,” he said.Since the 1971 war, India and Pakistan have approached different naval strategies.Obaidullah, who retired from the Pakistan Navy in 2008, said that India has tried to build a “blue water navy” capable of projecting power across oceans. The idea: “To assert its dominance in [the] Indian Ocean,” he said.Qazi, the maritime expert, agreed, saying that the Indian Navy has focused not just on building a numerical advantage in its naval assets but also on partnerships with nations such as Russia, which have helped it develop a powerful fleet.“The Indian Navy now has the ability to conduct missions that can cover long distances, all the way down to Mauritius near southern Africa, or even some adventures in [the] Pacific Ocean as well,” he said.As the world’s fifth-largest economy, India has invested heavily in naval development.According to the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), a London-based research institute focusing on defence and security issues, India has 29 principal surface combat vessels, including two aircraft carriers, 12 destroyers, 15 frigates and 18 submarines, of which two are nuclear-powered.Pakistan, by contrast, has prioritised its land and air forces. Its navy has grown more slowly, mainly through cooperation with China and Turkiye. It regularly holds major naval exercises with its allies, with the last one taking place in February this year.IISS data shows that Pakistan’s navy lacks aircraft carriers and destroyers but includes 11 frigates, eight submarines and at least 21 patrol vessels.Obaidullah explained that Pakistan’s naval ambitions and objectives are very different from those of India.“India aims to project global power. We have a defensive navy to secure our sea lines of communication and deter aggression,” the former naval officer said. With more than 95 percent of Pakistan’s trade sea-based, protecting maritime routes is its top priority.Maritime expert Qazi also said that the Pakistani Navy is focused on defending its “littoral zones”. From a naval perspective, a “littoral zone” is a critically important area close to coastlines, unlike the open ocean’s “blue water” expanse. It is within this space that countries engage in coastal defence.“Pakistan has a small economy, and we do not have blue water ambitions. We do not have the capacity to build a fleet, nor [do] we need one,” Qazi said. “Our defence paradigm is about defending our coastlines, and for that, we have our submarines, which carry cruise missiles.”The latest conflict saw both conventional and modern warfare, including drones used to strike deep inside each other’s territory. But Singh’s May 30 remarks suggest a more assertive naval posture in future conflicts, say analysts.“If Pakistan does any unholy act this time, it is possible that the opening will be done by our navy,” Singh said during his speech on May 30.Bhaskar, the Indian commodore who retired in 2007, agreed that future conflicts could see naval escalation.“If another military conflict escalates, the probability of navies being actively involved is high,” he said.Bashir Ali Abbas, a New Delhi-based maritime affairs expert and former fellow at the Stimson Center, in Washington, DC, said that naval platforms inherently serve multiple roles.Abbas said that warships and submarines can switch from patrolling missions or exercises to operational missions on short notice. But that would carry risks of its own.“Should the Indian Navy play a substantial role in operations against Pakistan following the next crisis, then the element of escalation control practically disappears. Any ship-on-ship, or ship-on-land engagement will imply that India and Pakistan are at war,” he told Al Jazeera, adding that the risk of inadvertent nuclear escalation is also potentially highest in the nuclear domain.Qazi, however, said that Singh’s statement was ambiguous about whether the Indian Navy would engage in surveillance or aggression.Any attack on Karachi, Pakistan’s economic hub, would provoke a strong response, the Lahore-based analyst said.“I believe India will choose to play hide and seek like it did this time,” Qazi said. But he added that there was a “high probability” that India could attack Pakistan’s naval installations on land, including its planes and radar stations. And that, he said, was an “alarming possibility”.",Operation Sindoor,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/6/11/are-india-and-pakistan-preparing-for-a-naval-faceoff-in-a-future-conflict,AL JAZEERA,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""framing"", ""reason"": ""The article frames the Indian Navy's potential role in future conflicts with Pakistan as assertive and proactive, while framing Pakistan's naval ambitions as defensive and limited."", ""confidence"": 0.8}",no,none,no framing bias
280,India general admits jet losses in clash with Pakistan: Here’s what he said,"General Anil Chauhan, India’s chief of defence staff, has admitted that an unspecified number of its jets were shot down during its conflict with Pakistan last month.The acknowledgement of aerial losses by the country’s highest-ranking general comes weeks after the two South Asian neighbours were engaged in their heaviest fighting in decades, which involved fighter planes and cruise missiles.Indian officials had previously refused to confirm or deny Pakistani claims of downing Indian jets. The conflict was triggered after armed men killed 26 tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir’s Pahalgam town on April 22.India’s first official admission of a loss of fighter jets came during Chauhan’s interviews on the sidelines of the Shangri-La Dialogue security forum in Singapore.India carried out strikes on what it called “terror infrastructure” in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir on May 7 in retaliation for the Pahalgam attack. India blamed armed groups backed by Pakistan for the April 22 attack.An armed group called The Resistance Front (TRF) claimed responsibility for the Pahalgam killings. India accused TRF of being an offshoot of the Pakistan-based armed group Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT). Pakistan denied involvement, condemning the Pahalgam attack and calling for a neutral investigation.India claimed to have targeted at least six cities in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir on the first day of the conflict. Pakistan initially asserted that it had downed six Indian jets in retaliation. But a senior Pakistan official later told Al Jazeera that five Indian aircraft were shot down in the aerial battle.India did not confirm or deny the Pakistani claims. “Losses are a part of combat,” Air Marshal AK Bharti, India’s director general of air operations, said at a news conference on May 11.The Indian embassy in China called reports of the downing of jets “disinformation”.After that, tit-for-tat cross-border attacks across the Line of Control (LoC), the de facto border between India- and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, rattled the region, renewing fears of a nuclear war.On May 10, United States President Donald Trump announced that the two countries had reached a ceasefire, potentially averting a “nuclear disaster”. India and Pakistan have given competing claims on casualties in the fighting, but more than 70 people were killed on both sides.Both India and Pakistan claim Kashmir in full but administer only parts of the Muslim-majority Himalayan territory.Here is what Chauhan said in recent interviews with the Reuters news agency and Bloomberg TV:Chauhan admitted that India suffered air losses on the first day of fighting without providing details.In an interview with Reuters, he said: “What was important is why did these losses occur and what we’ll do after that.”The general said, after the losses, the Indian army “rectified tactics” and then went back on May 7, 8 and 10 “in large numbers to hit airbases deep inside Pakistan, penetrated all their air defences with impunity, carried out precision strikes”. He added that the Indian air force “flew all types of aircraft with all types of ordnances” on May 10.Islamabad acknowledged that its airbases suffered minimal losses but denied that it had lost any planes.When a Bloomberg reporter asked Chauhan about Pakistan’s claims that six Indian jets were downed, Chauhan responded that this information was incorrect.He went on to say: “What is important is … not the jets being downed but why they were downed.” Some media outlets inferred that his statement appeared to imply that many jets were lost in the aerial battle.The general did not provide details about the number of jets downed or specifics about what these rectified tactics were.The Pakistani military said India did not fly its jets in the conflict again after suffering air losses.Media reports suggested that some attacks were near Pakistan’s nuclear sites, but the nuclear infrastructure itself was not a target.“Most of the strikes were delivered with pinpoint accuracy, some even to a metre [3.3ft] to whatever was our selected mean point of impact,” Chauhan told Reuters.He had previously provided assurances that India was not considering using nuclear weapons during the conflict. The chairman of Pakistan’s joint chiefs of staff, General Sahir Shamshad Mirza, has done the same for his country.“I think there’s a lot of space before that nuclear threshold is crossed, a lot of signalling before that. I think nothing like that happened. There’s a lot of space for conventional operations which has been created, and this will be the new norm,” Chauhan said.He added that on both sides, the most “rational people are in uniform” during conflict because they understand the consequences of “this kind of conflict”.“I found both sides displaying a lot of rationality in their thoughts as well as actions. So why should we assume that in the nuclear domain there will be irrationality on someone else’s part?”Chauhan said while Pakistan enjoys a close alliance with China, there was no sign that Beijing helped Islamabad during the conflict.China sits on India’s northern and northeastern borders, and controls a barely inhabited northeastern zone in Kashmir called Aksai Chin.“We didn’t find any unusual activity in the operational or tactical depth of our northern borders, and things were generally all right,” Chauhan said.When asked whether China provided Pakistan with intelligence information such as satellite imagery, the Indian general said such information is commercially available, and Pakistan could have obtained it from China or other sources.However, Chauhan said “almost 80 percent of the equipment” in Pakistan has been procured from China in the past few years.From 2020 to 2025, China supplied 81 percent of Pakistan’s arms imports, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.Chinese jets got a boost after media reports said Pakistan used Chinese-manufactured J-10C fighters in the air battle. The Chinese government did not officially confirm that the J-10C jets were used to down Indian planes, but state broadcaster CCTV posted on social media on May 17 that the jets achieved actual combat results for the first time.Chauhan said while hostilities have ceased, India would “respond precisely and decisively should there be any further terror attacks emanating from Pakistan”. He added that this will be a new normal for India.“So that has its own dynamics as far [as] the armed forces are concerned. It will require us to be prepared 24/7.”The president of the main opposition Indian National Congress party said Chauhan’s admission warrants a review of India’s defence preparedness.“There are some very important questions which need to be asked. These can only be asked if a Special Session of the Parliament is immediately convened,” Mallikarjun Kharge wrote in an X post on Saturday.Referring to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, he added: “The Modi Govt has misled the nation. The fog of war is now clearing.”“We salute [the Indian military’s] resolute courage and bravery,” Kharge said. “However, a comprehensive strategic review is the need of the hour.”The Congress has called the Pahalgam attack a “security and intelligence failure” and sought accountability, given that Indian-administered Kashmir is directly governed from New Delhi.But Michael Kugelman, director of the South Asia Institute at the Wilson Center in Washington, DC, said Chauhan’s interviews do not “change the war narrative in a big way”.“It confirms the jet losses that so many observers had assumed while emphasising the battlefield achievements of India that are already well known,” Kugelman told Al Jazeera.Still, the analyst said, the acknowledgement that Indian planes were downed “has triggered an uncomfortable question for New Delhi, and one that even some government supporters are posing: Why did it take so long to acknowledge a loss that [New] Delhi has shrugged off as inconsequential?”Kugelman argued, “India’s silence ended up emboldening Pakistan’s narrative and put India on the defensive and having to face awkward questions from global media.”“One can argue that had [New] Delhi earlier on acknowledged the jet losses while in the same breath focusing attention on its achievements, it would not have to be in reactive and defensive mode now on this issue,” he said.",Operation Sindoor,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/6/1/india-general-admits-jet-losses-in-clash-with-pakistan-heres-what-he-said,AL JAZEERA,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""tonality"", ""reason"": ""The article's tone is neutral and objective, but some phrases imply a slight criticism of India's handling of the situation, such as 'India's silence ended up emboldening Pakistan's narrative' and 'put India on the defen"", ""confidence"": 0.7}",yes,tonality,"tone is neutral and objective, but some phrases imply a slight criticism of India's handling of the situation, such as 'India's silence ended up emboldening Pakistan's narrative'"
281,‘No guardrails’: How India-Pakistan combat obliterated old red lines,"New Delhi, India – Guns have fallen silent for now along the tense India-Pakistan frontier, after a ceasefire that appears to have held for three nights.On May 7, India launched predawn attacks on what it called multiple “terror sites” across Pakistan to avenge the April 22 killing of 26 men, almost all of them tourists, in Indian-administered Kashmir’s resort town of Pahalgam. New Delhi accused Islamabad of backing the gunmen. Pakistan denied its involvement.India’s aerial assault kick-started four days of heightened tension, as both neighbours fired missiles and drones at each other’s military installations in a rapidly escalating cycle that brought them to the brink of full-scale war.Both sides have claimed to have decisively damaged, even destroyed, the other’s key strategic facilities, even though early evidence suggests more limited damage to military bases in both India and Pakistan.Yet even as India and Pakistan arrived at a ceasefire that United States President Donald Trump insists his administration brokered, experts say something has indeed been decimated, potentially beyond repair: Old red lines that had defined the tense relationship between the South Asian neighbours.“India and Pakistan have entered a phase of ‘armed coexistence’ with little room for diplomacy and a narrow margin for error, despite having a live and sensitive border,” Praveen Donthi, senior analyst at the International Crisis Group in New Delhi, told Al Jazeera.“This situation does not bode well for either country or the region, because even accidental triggers could escalate into a war-like situation with no guardrails in place.”The seeds of the India-Pakistan conflict were sown when their independence from British rule in 1947 was accompanied by a partition of the Indian subcontinent to create Pakistan.Since then, the two neighbours have fought four wars, three of them over Kashmir, a region they both control partially along with China, which governs two thin slices in the north. India claims all of Kashmir, while Pakistan claims all parts other than the ones governed by China, its ally.After their 1971 war that led to the creation of Bangladesh, India and Pakistan signed what is known as the Simla Agreement, which said “the two countries are resolved to settle their differences by peaceful means through bilateral negotiations.”While Pakistan has often cited United Nations resolutions to argue for international involvement in the resolution of the Kashmir dispute, India has cited the Simla Agreement for more than half a century to insist that any negotiations between the countries be strictly bilateral.To be sure, the US has since intervened to calm tensions between India and Pakistan: In 1999, for instance, President Bill Clinton pressured Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to withdraw troops from the icy heights of Indian-controlled Kargil, where they had entered. However, Washington publicly played coy about its role, allowing India to insist that the US had only helped with crisis management, not any dispute resolution mediation.That changed on Saturday, when US President Donald Trump upstaged New Delhi and Islamabad to announce a “full and immediate” India-Pakistan ceasefire hours before the governments of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi or his Pakistani counterpart Shehbaz Sharif confirmed the development.The next day, Trump went further. “I will work with you, both to see if, after a ‘thousand years,’ a solution can be arrived at concerning Kashmir,” he posted on his Truth Social platform.And on Monday, merely 30 minutes before Modi was scheduled for his first address since India launched attacks in Pakistan, Trump told reporters at the White House that his administration had leveraged trade to reach a ceasefire. “Let’s stop [the fighting]. If you stop it, we’ll do a trade. If you don’t stop it, we’re not going to do any trade,” Trump said. “And all of a sudden they said, ‘I think we’re going to stop.’ For a lot of reasons, but trade is a big one.”Such US mediation, were it to happen, would shatter India’s longstanding red line against mediation by other countries, say experts.“India has consistently sought to avoid third-party involvement in the Kashmir dispute even as it has occasionally welcomed third-party help in crisis management,” Christopher Clary, a former Pentagon official and a non-resident fellow at the Washington, DC-based Stimson Center, told Al Jazeera.When he spoke, Modi largely stuck to traditional positions he has taken after previous bouts of tension with Pakistan. He said “terror and talks cannot happen together,” and “water and blood cannot flow together,” a reference to the Indus Waters Treaty for sharing water between India and Pakistan, which New Delhi walked out of after the Pahalgam attack.Unlike Pakistan PM Sharif, who expressed gratitude to Trump for brokering a ceasefire, Modi claimed that India had “only paused” its military action – noting the decision was taken bilaterally. He did not mention Trump or his administration.Regardless, “the spectre of international intervention” in Kashmir has been resurrected, said Sumantra Bose, political scientist and the author of the 2021 book Kashmir at the Crossroads. He said India’s furious barrage of missiles and drones at Pakistan in response to the Pahalgam killings “catered to domestic jingoism but naturally roused global alarm”.India might, however, be helped in avoiding actual US intervention in Kashmir by the immediacy of the Trump administration’s other foreign policy goals, like the conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine, “that will divert already overburdened [American] policymakers to other tasks”, said Clary.According to Bose, India and Pakistan crossed not just red lines, “but a Rubicon by attacking numerous high-population targets in cities and towns” last week.India, in its most expansive offensive against Pakistan outside full-blown wars, said it hit “terrorist infrastructure” on May 7 as part of what it called Operation Sindoor. That was a reference to the vermillion that married Hindu women apply to their forehead, and an allusion to the manner in which the Pahalgam attack appears to have unfolded: Multiple witness accounts suggest the attackers segregated the men, then picked and hit non-Muslims.Modi claimed, in his Monday statement, that the Indian attacks had killed more than 100 “terrorists”. Pakistan has insisted that only 31 civilians – including two children – were killed in the May attacks.Yet both sides agree that the Indian missiles struck not just two cities – Muzaffarrabad and Kotli – in Pakistan-administered Kashmir, but also four cities in Pakistan’s Punjab province, the county’s economic heart and home to 60 percent of its population. The targets were Bahawalpur, Muridke, Shakar Garh and a village near Sialkot. This was the first time that India had struck Punjab since the 1971 war.As tensions spiked, India accused Pakistan of unleashing a swarm of drones towards it – a charge Islamabad denied. Then India launched a wave of drones that reached Pakistan’s biggest population centres, including its two biggest cities, Karachi and Lahore. In the early hours of May 10, India and Pakistan fired missiles at each other’s military bases across multiple provinces – far beyond disputed Kashmir – even hitting a few.Pakistan, which called its campaign Operation Bunyan Marsoos (a structure made of lead, in Arabic), targeted Indian air force bases and missile storage facilities in Drangyari, Udhampur, Uri and Nagrota (all in Indian-administered Kashmir), as well as in Pathankot, Beas and Adampur in Indian Punjab and Bhuj in Gujarat, Modi’s home state. Indian armed forces said that while they shot down most incoming missiles and drones, four air force bases suffered “limited damage”.“We don’t know what the quantum [of Indian losses] are, but clearly Pakistan has demonstrated capability to impose costs on India even as we try to impose costs on them,” Indian military historian and strategic analyst Srinath Raghavan told Al Jazeera.“Regarding red lines, another thing Pakistan sought to demonstrate was that they could keep this [the fighting] going till they had hit Indian military installations in retaliation.”Meanwhile, India too targeted the Nur Khan airbase near Rawalpindi, Murid airbase in Chakwal and the Rafiqui airbase in Shorkot.“India has shown that it is willing and capable of carrying out more strikes across the border, whether it’s a terrorist or even military infrastructure in Pakistan,” Raghavan said. India’s response went far beyond what happened in 2019, when Indian jets bombed what they described as a “terrorist camp” in Balakot, in Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, after a suicide bomber killed more than 40 Indian paramilitary soldiers.Now, the 2025 attacks will serve as the new baseline for India, experts said.“India would respond [in the future] on a similar scale, perhaps even a little bit more. Given the way both Balakot and the current crisis have played out, that should be the expectation,” said Raghavan.It isn’t just missiles and drones that the two sides fired at each other, though.Right after the Pahalgam attack, India suspended its participation in the Indus Waters Treaty, a 1960 agreement that had previously survived three wars – in 1965, 1971 and 1999 – unscathed. The treaty gives India access to the waters of the three eastern rivers of the Indus basin: The Ravi, Beas and Sutlej. Pakistan, in turn, gets the waters of the three western rivers: The Indus, Jhelum and Chenab.The river system is a vital lifeline for Pakistan, which relies on its waters. India, as the upper riparian state, has the ability – in theory at least – to restrict or stop the flow of the water into Pakistan. Islamabad described New Delhi’s decision to walk away from its obligations under the Indus Waters Treaty as an “act of war”.In an incendiary remark at the peak of the tensions, Pakistani former Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto said “either the water will flow, or their blood will,” seemingly referring to Indians.Three days after the ceasefire was announced, India has still not recommitted itself to the pact. In his speech on Monday evening, Modi’s statement that “blood and water cannot flow together” signalled that New Delhi had not yet decided to return to the treaty.Even as India and Pakistan ratcheted up their measures – first diplomatically, then militarily – against each other, the rest of the world was spooked by the prospect of what could have turned into a full-blown war between nuclear-armed neighbours.Up until now, that reality of nuclear weapons has affected India’s decisions in terms of how it treats its tensions with Pakistan, said Clary, the former Pentagon official. “India’s goal is to punish Pakistan without risking nuclear danger,” he said.But on Monday, Modi appeared to suggest that New Delhi was reassessing that approach. “India will not tolerate any nuclear blackmail. India will strike precisely and decisively at the terrorist hideouts developing under the cover of nuclear blackmail,” he said.Modi’s comments pointed to a “fundamental shift that has occurred in relations between India and Pakistan”, Donthi, the International Crisis Group analyst, said. “Both sides are willing to take greater risks and explore the potential for escalation below the nuclear threshold. However, there is very little space there, effectively making the euphemism of the region being a nuclear flashpoint truer than ever.”Modi’s comments on “nuclear blackmail” weren’t the only ones that marked a break from the past.When India launched attacks against Pakistan on May 7, it emphasised that it was only targeting “terrorist” bases and not attacking Pakistani military installations. However, on Monday, Modi said that in future, “India will not differentiate between the government sponsoring terrorism and the masterminds of terrorism.”That position raises the danger of war, said experts.“The conflation of terrorists and their (alleged) backers – namely, the military and the government – portends serious risks,” Donthi said. “It assumes that they are in lockstep. Such an assumption doesn’t take into account facts such as the seemingly successful ceasefire.”India and Pakistan had signed a ceasefire along the Line of Control (LoC) in 2003 and had renewed it in 2021. Despite cross-border firing along the LoC, the ceasefire had largely held until last week.With the threshold for a military conflict lowered, “the situation has become precarious,” Donthi said.“A single militant attack is all it takes to plunge into war, leaving no room for diplomacy and raising no questions. Any power hostile to either or both sides can exploit this.”",Operation Sindoor,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/13/no-guardrails-how-india-pakistan-combat-obliterated-old-red-lines,AL JAZEERA,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""framing"", ""reason"": ""The article frames the conflict as a 'phase of armed coexistence' with 'little room for diplomacy and a narrow margin for error', implying that India's actions are reckless and irresponsible.

282,India’s Modi tells Trump there was no US mediation in Pakistan truce,"Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has made it clear to United States President Donald Trump that a ceasefire between India and Pakistan after a four-day conflict in May was achieved through talks between the two militaries and not US mediation, a top diplomat in New Delhi says.“PM Modi told President Trump clearly that during this period, there was no talk at any stage on subjects like India-U.S. trade deal or US mediation between India and Pakistan,” Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri said in a press statement on Wednesday.“Talks for ceasing military action happened directly between India and Pakistan through existing military channels, and on the insistence of Pakistan. Prime Minister Modi emphasised that India has not accepted mediation in the past and will never do,” he said.Misri said the two leaders spoke over the phone late on Tuesday on Trump’s insistence after the two leaders were unable to meet on the sidelines of the G7 summit in Canada, which Modi attended as a guest. The call lasted 35 minutes.Trump had said last month that the nuclear-armed South Asian neighbours agreed to the ceasefire after talks mediated by the US, and that the hostilities ended after he urged the countries to focus on trade instead of war.There was no immediate comment from the White House on the Modi-Trump call.Pakistan has previously said the ceasefire was agreed after its military returned a call the Indian military had initiated on May 7.In an interview with Al Jazeera in May, Pakistan’s Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar rejected claims that Washington mediated the truce and insisted Islamabad acted independently.The conflict between India and Pakistan was triggered by an April 22 attack in Pahalgam, in Indian-administered Kashmir, in which 26 civilians, almost all tourists, were killed. India blamed armed groups allegedly backed by Pakistan, a charge Islamabad denied.On May 7, India launched missile strikes at multiple sites in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir. Over the next three days, the two countries exchanged artillery and air raids, hitting each other’s airbases.Pakistan said at least 51 people, including 11 soldiers and several children, were killed in Indian attacks.India’s military said at least five members of the armed forces were killed in Operation Sindoor, under which it launched the cross-border strikes.Misri said Trump expressed his support for India’s fight against “terrorism” and that Modi told him Operation Sindoor was still on.",Operation Sindoor,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/6/18/indias-modi-maintains-there-was-no-us-mediation-in-pakistan-ceasefire,AL JAZEERA,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""source"", ""reason"": ""The article relies on Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri's statement as the primary source to refute Trump's claim, while not providing a direct quote or comment from Pakistan's side."", ""confidence"": 0.8}",no,none,no source bias
283,Indian professor arrested over social media post on military operation,"A professor from an elite, private liberal-arts university in India has been arrested for a social media post about news briefings on the military operation against Pakistan more than a week after the two nuclear-armed neighbours agreed to a ceasefire, according to local media reports.Ali Khan Mahmudabad, an associate professor with the Department of Political Science at Ashoka University, was arrested on Sunday under sections of the criminal code pertaining to acts prejudicial to maintaining communal harmony, incitement of armed rebellion or subversive activities, and insults of religious beliefs.A police official told the Indian Express newspaper that the 42-year-old Muslim academic was arrested in the capital, New Delhi, 60km (37 miles) south of the university, located in Sonepat in Haryana state.A report by the online publication Scroll.in on Sunday quoted Mahmudabad’s lawyer as saying the case against him was filed on Saturday based on a complaint by Yogesh Jatheri, general secretary of the youth wing of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Haryana.The arrest was made days after the Haryana State Commission for Women summoned Mahmudabad for his comments on the daily briefings on India’s military operation in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir. Colonel Sofiya Qureshi and Wing Commander Vyomika Singh from the Indian armed forces held media briefings on Operation Sindoor, launched on May 6.In a Facebook post on May 8, Mahmudabad had said: “I am very happy to see so many right wing commentators applauding Colonel Sophia Qureishi but perhaps they could also equally loudly demand that the victims of mob lynchings, arbitrary bulldozing and others who are victims of the BJP’s hate mongering be protected as Indian citizens.“The optics of two women soldiers presenting their findings is importantly but optics must translate to reality on the ground otherwise it’s just hypocrisy.”The post referred to Qureishi, a Muslim officer in the Indian army, and attacks against Muslims, including lynchings and destruction of their houses without due process.According to local media reports, the Haryana Women’s Commission on Monday said the professor’s statement “disparaged women officers in the Indian Armed Forces and promoted communal disharmony” and summoned him.Mahmudabad has defended his comments and said on X that they had been misunderstood.“If anything, my entire comments were about safeguarding the lives of both citizens and soldiers. Furthermore, there is nothing remotely misogynistic about my comments that could be construed as anti-women,” he said.In February last year, the human rights group Amnesty International urged the government to stop “unjust targeted demolition of Muslim properties”.“The unlawful demolition of Muslim properties by the Indian authorities, peddled as ‘bulldozer justice’ by political leaders and media, is cruel and appalling. Such displacement and dispossession is deeply unjust, unlawful and discriminatory. They are destroying families – and must stop immediately,” said Agnes Callamard, Amnesty’s secretary-general.“The authorities have repeatedly undermined the rule of law, destroying homes, businesses or places of worship, through targeted campaigns of hate, harassment, violence and the weaponization of JCB bulldozers. These human rights abuses must be urgently addressed,” she said in a statement.India’s Supreme Court has ordered a halt to so-called bulldozer justice, but that has not stopped authorities from disregarding due process.The government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi of the BJP has also been accused of allowing far-right Hindu vigilante groups to act with impunity. They have lynched Muslims and tried to police interfaith relations. Modi has spoken against cow vigilante killings, but his government has done little to stop the activities of vigilante groups.My statement re the summons that I received from the Haryana State Women’s Commission.The posts that were misunderstood and objected to can be accessed on my Facebook page. pic.twitter.com/U4rZrAXhFx— Ali Khan Mahmudabad (@Mahmudabad) May 14, 2025Professors and activists across the country have shown their support for Mahmudabad.An open letter with about 1,200 signatories released on Friday said: “It is clear that Prof Khan praised the strategic restraint of the armed forces, analysed how any distinction between the terrorists or non-state actors and the Pakistani military has now collapsed, and said that the optics of the women officers chosen for media debriefs was ‘important’ as proof that the secular vision of the founders of our Republic is still alive.”The Amnesty International called for Professor Mahmudabad’s release.“The Haryana police must stop treating Professor Ali Khan Mahmudabad like a criminal simply for expressing an opinion,” Aakar Patel, chair of board at Amnesty International India, said: in a statement on Monday.“The shameful arrest of the Professor for a social media post seeking support for justice for victims of lynching and ‘bulldozer injustice’ in the country is a violation of his rights to freedom of expression and liberty.“The Haryana Police must immediately release Professor Mahmudabad and terminate the investigation against him.”The opposition Congress party chief Mallikarjun Kharge condemned the Muslim academic’s arrest.Mahmudabad’s arrest “shows how fearful the BJP is of any opinion disliked by them”, he posted on X.Pawan Khera, the chairman of the Congress media and publicity department, said: “It is not anti-national to show the mirror to the government whichever party is ruling. Ali is an academic and historian. What he has questioned the government on is the double standards.”The truce between India and Pakistan, announced on May 10, halted several days of missile and drone attacks across their shared border.

284,Turkiye’s Erdogan meets Pakistan PM in Istanbul weeks after India conflict,"Turkiye’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has held talks with Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif in Istanbul, weeks after a military conflict between Islamabad and New Delhi.The two countries would strive to boost cooperation, particularly in defence, energy and transportation, Erdogan’s office said on Sunday.Erdogan told Sharif it was in the interest of Turkey and Pakistan to increase solidarity in education, intelligence sharing and technological support in the fight against “terrorism”, Turkiye president’s office said.The meeting in the Turkish commercial capital comes as Ankara faces a backlash from India over its alleged supply of weapons to Islamabad during the recent conflict between the two South Asian neighbours. Ankara has denied sending weapons to Pakistan.In recent weeks, Erdogan had expressed solidarity with Pakistan after India conducted military attacks across nine sites in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir. New Delhi said the attacks were in response to an April 22 attack on tourists by armed fighters in Pahalgam in Indian-administered Kashmir, which left 25 Indians and one Nepalese national dead. India has accused Pakistan of indirectly supporting the attack – which Pakistan denies.Turkiye had warned of a risk of an “all-out war” between the nuclear-armed neighbours and called on both sides to “show good sense” to reduce the tensions, while expressing support for Islamabad’s request for an international inquiry into the Pahalgam attack.The two countries announced a ceasefire on May 10.Turkiye and Pakistan have long had close economic and military links.In February, Erdogan visited Islamabad, during which the two countries signed 24 cooperation agreements to bolster bilateral ties.In a sign of India’s displeasure with Ankara, India’s External Affairs Ministry spokesperson last week said that “relations are built on the basis of sensitivities to each other’s concerns”.“We expect Turkey to strongly urge Pakistan to end its support to cross-border terrorism and take credible and verifiable actions against the terror ecosystem it has harbored for decades,” Randhir Jaiswal said during a press briefing on Thursday.Meanwhile, grocery shops and leading online fashion retailers in India declared a boycott of Turkish products ranging from chocolates, coffee, jams, and cosmetics, as well as clothing.Indian fashion websites owned by Flipkart retail and billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance removed numerous Turkish apparel brands from their sites.India’s annual $2.7bn in goods imports from Turkiye, however, are dominated by mineral fuels and precious metals. We still do not know how the bilateral trade will be impacted amid the strained ties.Indian travel companies also suspended bookings of flights, hotels and holiday packages to Turkiye “in solidarity with India’s national interest and sovereignty”.India has not officially ordered companies to boycott Turkish products. But the country’s civil aviation ministry on May 15 revoked the security clearance of the Turkish-based aviation ground handling firm Celebi.",Operation Sindoor,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/25/turkiyes-erdogan-meets-pakistan-pm-in-istanbul-weeks-after-india-conflict,AL JAZEERA,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""source"", ""reason"": ""The article relies on Indian External Affairs Ministry spokesperson's statement as a source to express India's concerns, but does not provide a Turkish perspective or counter-source."", ""confidence"": 0.8}",no,none,no source bias
285,India and Pakistan near strategic standoff after Pahalgam attack in Kashmir,"Islamabad, Pakistan – Pakistan threatened to suspend its participation in all bilateral agreements with India, including the 1972 Simla Agreement, on Thursday in a retaliatory move after India said it would suspend its own participation in the Indus Water Treaty and close the land border the day before.The Simla Agreement was a peace accord signed by the two countries a few months after Bangladesh became independent from Pakistan.In a communique issued following a meeting of the National Security Committee (NSC), Pakistan’s top civil-military decision-making body, Pakistan has warned India that any disruption of its water supply would be considered “an act of war”, adding that it was prepared to respond, “with full force across the complete spectrum of national power”.The NSC meeting, which took place on Thursday in Islamabad, was led by Pakistani prime minister Shehbaz Sharif, alongside other government officials and chiefs of its military forces.The NSC statement mirrored actions announced by India on Wednesday, and included the closure of the Wagah Border Post with “immediate effect”, the suspension and cancellation of SAARC visas for Indian nationals (excluding Sikh pilgrims), the designation of Indian defence advisors as personae non grata in Pakistan, a reduction in the staff of the Indian High Commission, the closure of Pakistani airspace to Indian airlines, and the suspension of all trade with India.The moves follow India’s response to Tuesday’s attack on tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir, which resulted in the deaths of at least 26 people.Following a cabinet meeting on Wednesday, chaired by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the Indian government announced a series of measures, including the suspension of its part in the 65-year-old Indus Waters Treaty, a pact that allows both countries to irrigate their agricultural lands.In a media conference, Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri also announced the closure of the border with Pakistan, slashed the number of Indian diplomatic staff in Pakistan, ordered Pakistani citizens under the SAARC scheme to leave the country within 48 hours, and expelled Pakistani military attaches posted in India. This response has been soundly interpreted as India blaming Pakistan for the attack in Kashmir.The Himalayan territory of Kashmir has been a flashpoint between the two countries since they gained independence from British rule in 1947, with each country controlling parts of Kashmir but claiming it in full. Since independence, the nuclear-armed neighbours have fought four wars, three of them over Kashmir.Pakistan’s Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, who also serves as deputy prime minister, called the Indian steps “immature and hasty” in a television interview on Wednesday night, .“India has not given any evidence [of Pakistani involvement in the attack].” They have not shown any maturity in their response. This is not a serious approach. They started creating hype immediately after the incident,” said Dar, who also serves as deputy prime minister.Defence Minister Khawaja Asif also rejected India’s implication of Pakistani involvement in the attack.“India’s allegation against Pakistan for the Pahalgam incident is inappropriate. There should be no ambiguity that we strongly condemn terrorism,” Asif said.Following the Pahalgam attack, commentary in Indian media and talk among the political leadership has leaned towards launching a military strike on Pakistan, drawing parallels with the 2019 Balakot strikes.In February 2019, following an attack in Pulwama, Indian-administered Kashmir, in which more than 40 Indian soldiers were killed, India launched air strikes in Balakot, northern Pakistan, targeting what it called “militant hideouts”.Pakistan said the strikes only hit an uninhabited forest and responded with its own air strikes near Indian military targets, causing no casualties.Both sides also deployed fighter jets and, in an aerial dogfight, an Indian aircraft was shot down. Its pilot, Abhinandan Varthaman, was captured but released two days afterwards.Indian Defence Minister Rajnath Singh also hinted at a “strong response”, reiterating India’s “zero tolerance” policy on terrorism.“We will not only reach out to those who have carried out this incident. We will also reach out to those who, sitting behind the scenes, have conspired to commit such nefarious acts on the soil of India,” he said, at the Marshal of the Air Force Arjan Singh Memorial Lecture in New Delhi on April 23.Analysts and security officials in Pakistan say they believe that Indian military action could now be possible, but said the country was “ready for any Indian misadventure”.“We are maintaining a high level of alertness and vigilance, but unlike India, we don’t want to create any unnecessary hype by talking about our readiness,” a security source told Al Jazeera on condition of anonymity, as he has not been authorised to speak on the matter.“India is wrong if it thinks there isn’t going to be any tit for tat. However, we are both nuclear-armed countries, and Indian aggression could lead to an irresponsible situation. Both of us should act carefully,” he added.The official further questioned India’s allegation of Pakistani involvement, noting that the attack took place nearly 200km (124 miles) from the Line of Control, the de facto border between the two countries, and highlighted the presence of more than 500,000 Indian security personnel in the Kashmir valley.He also pointed to the recent visit to India by United States Vice President JD Vance, who arrived in the country on Monday with his wife and two children for a four-day visit, taking in a meeting with Prime Minister Modi.“How do you think this attack will serve Pakistan, especially with JD Vance being there?” he asked. “Could this attack lead to the liberation of Indian Kashmir? Why won’t Indian authorities take time to look inward and introspect? Will they ever accept their own security shortcomings?”Past skirmishes have previously raised the spectre of war between the two countries, which together have a population exceeding 1.5 billion.Asfandyar Mir, a security analyst specialising in South Asia, said Pakistan is likely to reserve its military response for a contingency in case of Indian action while monitoring how the suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty unfolds.The Indus Basin is a lifeline for the populations of Pakistan and India, who rely on the river water flowing from the Himalayas for irrigation and agriculture.However, Mir added that military action increasingly appears to be a likely option for India, similar to 2019, but “potentially more visible”.Referring to the outrage over Tuesday’s attack and calls for a strong response in the Indian media, he said: “The domestic mood in India is strongly trending toward a response. That said, India faces a more acute China challenge than in 2019, so it has to carefully factor that into its response and how an escalation may play out,” he told Al Jazeera.China, India’s northern neighbour, is also one of Pakistan’s closest allies. China and India engaged in a minor conflict on their border in June 2020.On the other hand, Salman Bashir, former Pakistani envoy to New Delhi, told Al Jazeera he believes the decisions made by India’s Cabinet Committee on Security have been based on a “mistaken assumption” about Pakistan’s weakness.“These connote a fight-to-the-finish syndrome, which is based on naivete and wishful thinking. But I expect a response from Pakistan which is mature and commensurate to the challenge posited by India,” he added.Bashir, who also served as Pakistan’s foreign secretary from 2008 to 2012, said the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led Indian government may have considered military action, but the scale of such moves, given the history between the two countries, presents a dilemma.“In any case, Pakistan will not assume that this is it. We should be prepared for more to come. Options for diplomacy are rather slim. A back-channel contact may work, but I am not sure there is one,” the former diplomat said.Mir, the Washington DC-based security analyst, said Pakistan is more stable than in previous years and that he believes the country is therefore likely to respond forcefully under army chief Asim Munir, who has accused India of conducting “proxy operations” in Pakistan.Pakistan has blamed India for violence on its soil, most recently accusing it of masterminding the March attack on the Jaffar Express, a passenger train targeted by Baloch separatists.The 36-hour standoff, in which at least 26 passengers were killed, was Pakistan’s first-ever train hijacking.However, Mir said both sides have failed to draw constructive lessons from the 2019 crisis.“The relative calm we saw after 2019 was largely a function of bold conciliation by former Pakistani Army chief General Bajwa and India choosing to focus on its border with China and its ambition to become a global power. But careful observers knew the relationship was only deteriorating,” he said.Bashir, the former envoy, said Pakistan could make a grand gesture if Prime Minister Sharif announces a visit to India.“In Pakistan-India situations, gestures like Shehbaz Sharif announcing a visit to New Delhi are doable. The pendulum has swung too far. We need to do whatever is necessary to bring things under control,” he said.",Operation Sindoor,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/4/24/india-and-pakistan-head-towards-a-strategic-standoff-after-pahalgam-attack,AL JAZEERA,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""framing"", ""reason"": ""The article frames the situation as a potential 'strategic standoff' between India and Pakistan, emphasizing India's actions as retaliatory and Pakistan's responses as defensive.

286,Pakistan announces retaliatory measures against India after Kashmir attack,"Pakistan has announced a series of retaliatory diplomatic moves against India and demanded evidence to back up the Indian government’s claims that Islamabad was involved in the Kashmir attack.Suspected rebels killed at least 26 people on Tuesday in the picturesque tourist resort of Pahalgam in the deadliest such attack in a quarter-century in Indian-administered Kashmir. A statement issued in the name of The Resistance Front (TRF), which is believed to be an offshoot of the Pakistani-based Lashkar-e-Taiba armed group, claimed responsibility for the attack.India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi promised in a speech on Thursday to hunt the Pahalgam gunmen to the “ends of the earth”. New Delhi has also suspended India’s participation in a water-sharing agreement and sealed its main land border with Pakistan among other retaliatory measures.On Thursday, Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also paused a canal irrigation project, a day after India withdrew from the Indus Waters Treaty in a move that has caused concern about Pakistan’s water supplies.In a statement released by his office, Sharif said that while Pakistan is concerned about the loss of the tourists’ lives [in Indian-administered Kashmir], “the Committee reviewed the Indian measures announced on 23 April 2025 and termed them unilateral, unjust, politically motivated, extremely irresponsible and devoid of legal merit.”“In the absence of any credible investigation and verifiable evidence, attempts to link the Pahalgam attack with Pakistan are frivolous, devoid of rationality and defeat logic,” the statement added.Pakistan’s Defence Minister Khawaja Asif later told Al Jazeera, “I refute, strongly refute, the allegations levelled by the Indian government,” and added that the country has “no connection” with armed groups operating in Indian-administered Kashmir.Islamabad has also announced the impending closure of the Wagah border with India, but said it will remain open until April 30. All Indian citizens, excluding Sikh pilgrims, were ordered to leave in 48 hours.Pakistan also suspended visas issued to Indians under the SAARC programme, reduced the Indian High Commission staff in Islamabad to 30 and closed its airspace to all Indian aircraft, while all trade activities with India were suspended.Reporting from Haripur in Pakistan, Al Jazeera’s Kamal Hyder said it was a “tit-for-tat response”.“All eyes will be on what India does next, because Modi has been saying that there will be a swift response. He’s meeting his party leaders in India, so that will be important,” he said.“But Islamabad has not minced its words, either, by saying that any military response will be met reciprocally from the Pakistani side as well,” he added.Pakistan and India both claim Kashmir in its entirety but administer parts of it separately.On Thursday, Police in India-administered Kashmir released sketches and announced a reward for information about three suspects believed to be behind Tuesday’s deadly attack.A reward of 2 million Indian rupees (about $23,000) has been offered for any information leading to their capture.Police say the suspects are members of the group Lashkar-e-Taiba; they have been named as Hashim Musa (alias Sulaiman), Ali Bhai (alias Talha Bhai), and Adil Hussain Thoker.According to police, Musa and Bhai are believed to be Pakistani nationals.Thoker, also known as Adil Guree, is a resident of Kashmir, and investigators have linked him to the attack based on testimony from the wife of one of the victims.A senior police official told Al Jazeera that more than 1,500 people have been detained for questioning in connection with the continuing investigation.The region remains tense with heightened security and unease widespread across the region, two days after the Pahalgam attack.But shops and businesses began reopening following a shutdown observed in protest yesterday.Local trade bodies and political leaders had called for the shutdown as they took to the streets to condemn the deadly assault.“Everything looks gloomy. We don’t know what the future holds for this place,” said Mehraj Ahmad Malik, who sells dried fruits in the main city of Srinagar.“Everything was abuzz two days ago, and now there is fear and silence.”Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah has expressed deep sorrow over the recent attack in Pahalgam, acknowledging the loss of “25 guests who came here to enjoy their vacation” and praising a resident who “sacrificed his life to save the people there”.“The people of Kashmir came out and voiced the same thing: that they were not involved and the attack was not for them,” he told India’s ANI news agency.“Please don’t think that Kashmiris are your enemies; we are not guilty of it … We have also suffered for the last 35 years.”",Operation Sindoor,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/4/24/pakistan-announces-retaliatory-measures-against-india-after-kashmir-attack,AL JAZEERA,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""source"", ""reason"": ""The article relies heavily on Pakistani sources (e.g., Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif's statement, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif's interview with Al Jazeera) and presents their views as factual, while Indian sources are m"", ""confidence"": 0.8}",yes,source,"relies heavily on Pakistani sources (e.g., Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif's statement, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif's interview with Al Jazeera) and presents their views as factual"
287,India claims to have killed all suspects of Kashmir’s Pahalgam attack,"India’s Home Minister Amit Shah has said three suspected rebels killed in Indian-administered Kashmir were responsible for the April killings of tourists in the disputed region’s Pahalgam that led to an intense military conflict with Pakistan.The minister’s comments came on Tuesday, a day after the heavily-armed suspects were killed in a joint operation by the military, paramilitary and police on the outskirts of Kashmir’s main city of Srinagar.“I want to tell the Parliament, those who attacked in Baisaran were three terrorists and all three have been killed,” said Shah, referring to the area near the Kashmiri town of Pahalgam where 26 people, mostly Hindu tourists, were shot dead on April 22.India accused Pakistan of backing the attackers, a charge Islamabad denied, leading to an intense four-day conflict between the nuclear-armed rivals in May that killed more than 70 people on both sides.Shah said all three were Pakistani nationals and identified two of them as members of Lashkar-e-Taiba, a Pakistan-based armed group.“Indian security agencies have detailed evidence of their involvement in the attack,” Shah said in a speech in the Lok Sabha, the lower house of Parliament.Monday’s operation took place in the mountains of Dachigam, about 30km (18 miles) from Srinagar, the army said in a statement.Shah said a security meeting was held immediately after the attack, and it was decided that the attackers should not be “allowed to leave the country and return to Pakistan”.Investigators relied on witness accounts and forensic evidence to establish that the rifles found on the men were the same ones that were used in the April attack, he said.“It was confirmed that these three rifles were involved in the killing of our innocent civilians,” said Shah.All those killed in the April attack were listed as residents of India except one man from Nepal. Survivors said the attackers had separated the men from the women and children and ordered some of them to recite the Muslim declaration of faith.Another armed group called The Resistance Front (TRF) initially claimed responsibility for the attack. But as public criticism mounted over the killings, it retracted the claim.Earlier this month, the United States designated TRF as a “foreign terrorist organisation”.Muslim-majority Kashmir has been divided between India and Pakistan since their independence from British rule in 1947, and the neighbours – who both claim the region in full – have fought two wars and several conflicts over its control.Since 1989, Kashmiri rebels have been fighting against Indian rule, demanding independence or the region’s merger with Pakistan. India accuses Pakistan of backing the violence, but Islamabad says it only provides diplomatic support to the Kashmiris’ struggle for self-determination.",Operation Sindoor,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/7/29/rebels-behind-kashmir-attack-that-led-to-pakistan-tensions-killed-india,AL JAZEERA,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""source"", ""reason"": ""The article relies heavily on Indian Home Minister Amit Shah's statements and quotes, without providing a balanced perspective from Pakistani sources or experts."", ""confidence"": 0.8}",no,none,no source bias
288,"Fragile truce holds between India, Pakistan after days of fierce exchanges","A ceasefire between India and Pakistan appears to be holding, after both sides accused each other of initial violations, as an uneasy calm has taken hold following days of the worst eruption of fighting between the nuclear-armed neighbours in decades.The Indian military sent a “hotline message” to Pakistan on Sunday about violations of an agreed-upon ceasefire, informing it of New Delhi’s intent to respond if this was repeated, a top Indian army officer said.India’s Director General of Military Operations (DGMO) was speaking on Sunday as a fragile 24-hour-old ceasefire appeared to be holding after both sides blamed the other for initial violations on Saturday night.The truce announced on Saturday halted several days of missiles and drones being fired at each country across their shared border, killing almost 70 people.Diplomacy and pressure from the United States helped secure the ceasefire deal when it seemed that the conflict was spiralling towards a full-scale war. Within hours of its coming into force, there were explosions in Indian-administered Kashmir, the centre of much of last week’s fighting.Blasts from air-defence systems boomed in cities near the border under a blackout, similar to those heard during the previous two evenings, according to local authorities, residents and witnesses.“Sometimes, these understandings take time to fructify, manifest on the ground,” Lieutenant General Rajiv Ghai, the Indian DGMO, told a media briefing, referring to the truce. “The [Indian] armed forces were on a very, very high alert [yesterday] and continue to be in that state.”The Indian army chief had given a mandate to its commanders to deal with “violations of any kind” from across the borders in the best way they deem fit, Ghai added.He said his Pakistani counterpart called him on Saturday afternoon and proposed the two countries “cease hostilities” and urgently requested a ceasefire.There was no immediate response to the Indian comments from Pakistan. Early on Sunday, the Pakistani Foreign Ministry had said that it was committed to the truce agreement and blamed India for the violations.US President Donald Trump announced the ceasefire on Saturday, saying it was reached after talks mediated by Washington.US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said India and Pakistan had also agreed to start talks on “a broad set of issues at a neutral site”.While Islamabad has thanked Washington for facilitating the ceasefire and welcomed Trump’s offer to mediate on the Kashmir dispute with India, New Delhi has not commented on US involvement in the truce or talks at a neutral site.India maintains that disputes with Pakistan have to be resolved directly by the two countries and rejects any third-party involvement.On Sunday, Trump praised the leaders of both countries for agreeing to halt the aggression and said he would “substantially” increase trade with them.Hindu-majority India and Muslim-majority Pakistan each rule a part of disputed Kashmir but claim it in full, and have twice gone to war over the Himalayan region.India blames Pakistan for an insurgency in its part of the territory, but Pakistan says it provides only moral, political and diplomatic support to Kashmiri separatists.Among those most affected by the fighting were residents on either side of the border, many of whom fled their homes when the fighting began on Wednesday, two weeks after a deadly attack in Indian-administered Kashmir’s Pahalgam that India said was backed by Islamabad.Pakistan denied the accusation.Al Jazeera’s Osama Bin Javaid, reporting from Lahore, Pakistan, said it was “a tough night for a lot of people in the border areas”.“People said there was shelling in the early hours of the morning and throughout the evening, even after the announcement of ceasefire,” Bin Javaid said.Although people are cautious, they’re “not coming back yet to their homes because they believe that this is not over yet”, he said, adding that there has been damage in several villages across the Line of Control.Overall, however, “there’s jubilation and celebration,” Bin Javaid added.In the Indian border city of Amritsar, home to the Golden Temple revered by Sikhs, people returned to the streets on Sunday morning after a siren sounded to signal the resumption of normal activities following the tension of recent days.“Ever since the terrorists attacked people in Pahalgam, we have been shutting our shops very early and there was an uncertainty. I am happy that at least there will be no bloodshed on both sides,” said Satvir Singh Alhuwalia, 48, a shopkeeper in the city.Another local resident noted the “calm” and “happiness” throughout the Kashmir Valley since the ceasefire announcement.“You can feel it in the air … but there seems to be a bit of fear, as well. Will it hold, given the past history of both these nations?” asked Muteeb Banday.“[Kashmiris] want … long-lasting peace, so that we can go and live our lives, think about our future, make our lives better.”In some border areas, however, people were asked not to return home just yet. In the Indian-administered Kashmir city of Baramulla, authorities warned residents to stay away due to the threat posed by unexploded munitions.“People here are hosting us well, but just as a bird feels at peace in its own nest, we also feel comfortable only in our own homes, even if they have been damaged,” said Azam Chaudhry, 55, who fled his home in the Pakistani town of Khuiratta and has now been told to wait until Monday before returning.In Indian-administered Kashmir’s Uri, a key power plant that was damaged in a Pakistani drone attack is still under repair.“The project has suffered minor damage … We have stopped generation as the transmission line has been damaged,” said an official from state-run NHPC, India’s biggest hydropower company, who did not want to be identified.",Operation Sindoor,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/11/fragile-truce-holds-between-india-pakistan-after-days-of-fierce-exchanges,AL JAZEERA,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""source"", ""reason"": ""The article relies heavily on Indian and US sources (DGMO, Trump, Rubio) while Pakistani sources are underrepresented.

289,Pakistan blames India after seven soldiers killed in Balochistan blast,"Seven Pakistani army soldiers have been killed when their vehicle was targeted by an improvised explosive device in the southwestern province of Balochistan, Pakistan’s military says, blaming India for the attack amid rising tensions.Pakistan’s military said members of the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) armed group targeted the vehicle carrying the soldiers in the province bordering Iran and Afghanistan on Tuesday.It described the group as an “Indian proxy”, but it did not provide any evidence to support its claim. There was no immediate comment from New Delhi or the BLA.An unnamed senior local government official told the AFP news agency the vehicle that was hit was part of a convoy on its way to a security operation.He said five people were wounded and taken by helicopter to a military hospital in the provincial capital, Quetta.More than 200 people, mostly members of the security forces, have been killed in 2025 by armed groups in Balochistan and neighbouring Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, according to an AFP tally.At least 31 people, many of them soldiers, were killed in March when the BLA hijacked a train carrying more than 400 passengers while travelling from Quetta to the northern city of Peshawar.The bombing of the military convoy was carried out amid heightened tensions between nuclear-armed Pakistan and India after a shooting attack in India-administered Kashmir’s Pahalgam region on April 22 that killed 25 Indian tourists and one Nepalese citizen.India blamed Pakistan for backing the “terrorist” group that carried out the attack, a charge Islamabad has denied.After the Pahalgam attack, India and Pakistan have taken a series of steps against each other with Pakistan warning that India may be preparing to launch military attacks.The two countries have suspended trade, shut down a land border crossing, closed off their airspace to one another, expelled citizens and diplomats, and India has suspended a key water treaty.On Tuesday, Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif along with the deputy prime minister, foreign and defence ministers, and the military chiefs visited the headquarters of the Directorate for Inter-Services Intelligence, the country’s top spy agency, to attend a security briefing.Pakistan has conducted two missile tests in three days while India has announced plans for civil defence drills across several states on Wednesday that will include air raid sirens and evacuation plans.The two countries also aired their grievances during a United Nations Security Council meeting in New York on Monday.UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has emphasised the need to avoid a military confrontation that could “easily spin out of control”.“Now is the time for maximum restraint and stepping back from the brink,” he said on Monday.",Operation Sindoor,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/6/pakistan-blames-india-after-seven-soldiers-killed-in-balochistan-blast,AL JAZEERA,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""source"", ""reason"": ""The article relies on Pakistan's military statement as fact without providing evidence to support the claim that India is responsible for the attack."", ""confidence"": 0.8}",yes,source,article relies on Pakistan's military statement as fact without providing evidence to support the claim that India is responsible for the attack
290,Pakistan vows retaliation after India launches air strikes,"Pakistan has promised to retaliate after India launched military strikes on Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, fuelling fears of a broader confrontation between the nuclear-armed neighbours.Pakistan’s government on Wednesday pledged to respond “at a time, place and manner of its choosing to avenge the loss of innocent Pakistani lives and blatant violation of its sovereignty”.Pakistan’s military said at least 31 civilians were killed and 46 others injured in the Indian attacks and ensuing cross-border shelling, describing the strikes as having “ignited an inferno in the region”.In New Delhi, Indian officials briefed more than a dozen foreign envoys, telling them: “If Pakistan responds, India will respond”.It comes amid spiralling tensions following a deadly attack last month on Hindu tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir, which India blamed on Pakistan-based fighters. Islamabad has denied any involvement.India’s government said its forces targeted nine sites it described as “terrorist infrastructure”, including facilities allegedly linked to the fighters who killed 25 tourists and one local in last month’s Kashmir attack.However, in Muzaffarabad, the capital of Pakistan-administered Kashmir, residents said Indian missiles struck a mosque-seminary in the city centre.The building, which included residential quarters, was left in ruins, with five missiles reportedly killing three people inside the two-storey structure.Meanwhile, heavy cross-border shelling and gunfire continued along the Line of Control (LoC), the de facto border dividing Kashmir. Officials said 13 civilians were killed and 43 wounded on the Indian side, while at least six civilians were killed on the Pakistani side.Pakistan’s Prime Minister’s Office claimed that five Indian fighter jets and drones were shot down during the escalation. The Indian embassy in Beijing dismissed reports of downed aircraft as “disinformation”.Pakistan’s Foreign Minister Mohammad Ishaq Dar told TRT World that there had been communication between the national security advisers of the two countries, while Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif pledged that Pakistan would respond decisively.“For the blatant mistake that India made last night, it will now have to pay the price,” Sharif said on state broadcaster PTV. “Perhaps they thought that we would retreat, but they forgot that … this is a nation of brave people.”Al Jazeera’s Osama Bin Javaid, reporting from Islamabad, said that retaliation from Pakistan was widely anticipated.“Pakistan is expected to retaliate within the next 24 to 48 hours, and that’s something we’ve been hearing from politicians across the board,” he said.“They’re citing Article 51 of the United Nations Charter, which says that a country has the right to respond to an unprovoked act of aggression.”India defended its actions, with Defence Minister Rajnath Singh claiming its “targets we had set were destroyed with exactness according to a well-planned strategy”.“We have shown sensitivity by ensuring that no civilian population was affected in the slightest,” he added.Islamabad claims six sites targeted by India were not linked to armed groups.The Pakistani military said 57 commercial aircraft from multiple countries, including Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the UAE, Thailand, South Korea and China, were in Pakistan’s airspace at the time of India’s attack, putting thousands of passengers at risk.India has since ordered the closure of at least 21 civilian airports in the northern and western parts of the country for passenger flights until May 10, The Hindu reported.Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan spoke with Prime Minister Sharif and expressed Ankara’s support. According to the Turkish presidency, Erdogan praised Pakistan’s “calm and restrained policies” during the crisis.In Washington, United States President Donald Trump said he hoped to help de-escalate the situation. “I want to see it stop. And if I can do anything to help, I will be there,” he told reporters at the White House. “We want to see them work it out.”Uday Chandra, assistant professor of government at Georgetown University in Qatar, said while retaliation from Pakistan was expected, it appeared that neither country was seeking “an all-out war”.",Operation Sindoor,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/7/pakistan-vows-retaliation-after-india-launches-air-strikes,AL JAZEERA,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""framing"", ""reason"": ""The article frames India's actions as 'blatant violation of its sovereignty' and Pakistan's response as 'avenge[ing] the loss of innocent Pakistani lives', while India is quoted as saying it targeted 'terrorist infrastru"", ""confidence"": 0.8}",yes,framing, frames India's actions as 'blatant violation of its sovereignty' and Pakistan's response as 'avenge[ing] the loss of innocent Pakistani lives
291,‘Slippery slope’: How will Pakistan strike India as tensions soar?,"Islamabad, Pakistan – On Wednesday evening, as Pakistan grappled with the aftermath of a wave of missile strikes from India that hit at least six cities, killing 31 people, the country’s military spokesperson took to a microphone with a chilling warning.“When Pakistan strikes India, it will come at a time and place of its own choosing,” Lieutenant General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry said in a media briefing. “The whole world will come to know, and its reverberation will be heard everywhere.”Two days later, India and Pakistan have moved even closer to the brink of war.On Thursday, May 8, Pakistan accused India of flooding its airspace with kamikaze drones that were brought down over major cities, including Lahore and Karachi. India confirmed the drone assault, but said it was responding to a provocation from Pakistan — missiles and drones launched towards cities and air defence systems in India and Indian-administered Kashmir. Pakistan denied that charge, and subsequent accusations of missile and drone attacks on parts of Indian-administered Kashmir on Thursday night.With Pakistan denying any missile or drone strikes against India, Chaudhry’s warning of upcoming retribution remains alive, hovering over the 1.6 billion people of South Asia, 17 days after armed gunmen killed  26 male civilians in Pahalgam, Indian-administered Kashmir, triggering the current escalation.Experts say how Pakistan responds will likely be shaped by its desire to demonstrate that it can hurt India, without pushing the crisis over the edge into a full-blown conflict.“We are still far away from a war, but we are much closer than we were 24 hours ago,” said Christopher Clary, assistant professor of political science at the University at Albany.Clary said that the next “logical escalatory” step for both countries might be to target each other’s military bases.“We have already seen this with air defence-focused strikes,” Clary told Al Jazeera, referring to the Indian drone attacks that tried to target Pakistani radar systems overnight on May 7-8, and New Delhi’s claims that Pakistan launched missiles and drones towards its military facilities.“But I fear other strikes are likely in the next 24 hours. I think we are still several days from de-escalation,” Clary said, adding that more deaths are likely.India and Pakistan have been at loggerheads since gaining independence from British colonial rule in August 1947, especially over the scenic Kashmir Valley in the northwestern subcontinent. Both control parts of it, with China in control of two thin slices. India claims all of Kashmir, while Pakistan claims all of Kashmir except the parts held by China, its ally.They have fought multiple wars over Kashmir. The last major escalation occurred in February 2019, when India accused Pakistan of supporting armed groups responsible for a suicide bombing that killed 40 Indian soldiers in Pulwama, in Indian-administered Kashmir.In response, India crossed the border for the first time since the 1971 war, launching air strikes in Balakot, Pakistan’s northwest, claiming to have hit “terrorist infrastructure” and having killed “hundreds of fighters”.Pakistan countered that the area was a forest and reported no casualties. It responded the next day with its own fighter jets, leading to a dogfight and the downing of an Indian jet. The captured pilot, Abhinandan Varthaman, was later returned to India, easing tensions.Kamran Bokhari, senior director at the New Lines Institute for Strategy and Policy in Washington, DC, called the current situation “much more dangerous” than in 2019.India, he said, appeared to be locked into an “escalatory spiral”.“In case Pakistan makes a move, India will respond and up the ante,” he said.“This is a new situation for Pakistan. For the military to say that it will respond in a time of its own choosing suggests they want to think it through, to strike in a manner that does not lead to escalation. But how that materialises is a function of capability and constraint.”It took India 12 days to respond to the Pulwama killings with the Balakot strike in 2019. In the current conflict, the Indian response took even longer, 15 days, via “Operation Sindoor,” which struck multiple Pakistani cities, including ones in Punjab, close to the Indian border.Some analysts argue that while Pakistan has so far calibrated its response diplomatically and militarily, the drone strikes on Thursday morning marked a “serious escalation”.“The military is expected to respond in a manner that is firm and resolute, drawing on both public and political support. The scale of Pakistan’s response will be quite telling,” said Arsla Jawaid, associate director at global consulting firm Control Risks, while speaking to Al Jazeera.She said Pakistan is likely to opt for precision strikes targeting Indian military assets while avoiding civilian casualties.“This could issue a decisive response while minimising further escalation. The latter will be a critical calculation in any Pakistani response,” she added.Sahar Khan, a Washington, DC-based security analyst focused on South Asia, agreed that Pakistan will “definitely” respond.Khan said India had crossed several “red lines,” including suspending the Indus Waters Treaty after the Pahalgam attack, and launching missile and drone attacks. The Indus Waters Treaty (IWT), mediated by the World Bank and signed in 1960, governs the distribution of Indus River waters, critical for millions across the subcontinent, particularly in Pakistan.“The question is, what will they [the Pakistani military] target? That will determine the escalation dynamics and the eventual off-ramps,” she told Al Jazeera.“I think Pakistan will retaliate, showcasing its military capabilities. Its defence systems remain intact, and that is an added incentive to respond,” Khan added.With brinkmanship at its peak and both sides locked in aggressive posturing, the greatest fear remains that even a small miscalculation could lead to a fully fledged war between two nations with more than 150 nuclear weapons each.Bokhari warned that India’s strikes in Punjab, Pakistan’s most populous and prosperous province, marked a dangerous precedent.“By attacking Punjab, which was almost unthinkable, India has now made this the new normal. This is a real slippery slope,” he said.Jawaid concurred, noting that drone strikes on Pakistani urban centres also suggest a shift in red lines.“That opens the door to a sustained and heightened risk of escalation, which is deeply problematic due to the risk of miscalculation on both sides. We are in a case of who blinks first,” she said.But Khan believes that there are a few potential off-ramps.“The first is the international community, such as the US, China, and Russia, urging restraint. The second is for India and Pakistan to show willingness to redefine red lines, like India agreeing to the IWT again and Pakistan agreeing not to strike Indian military targets,” she said.Jawaid, however, warned that even if India and Pakistan avoid a war, their already deeply strained equation has changed – there’s a new normal that will define it.“The longer this is sustained, the more challenging it becomes,” she said. “The bilateral relationship is already fraught with heightened tensions, which will continue even if the current conflict settles down, especially due to unresolved issues around natural resources and Kashmir, which remains a flashpoint.”",Operation Sindoor,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/9/slippery-slope-how-will-pakistan-strike-india-as-tensions-soar,AL JAZEERA,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""framing"", ""reason"": ""The article frames the situation as a 'slippery slope' and emphasizes India's aggressive actions, using phrases like 'India has now made this the new normal' to create a sense of escalating danger."", ""confidence"": 0.8}",yes,framing," frames the situation as a 'slippery slope' and emphasizes India's aggressive actions, using phrases like 'India has now made this the new normal' to create a sense of escalating danger."
292,"Trump offers to work with India, Pakistan on Kashmir ‘solution’","United States President Donald Trump has offered to work with India and Pakistan to achieve a “solution” for the long-disputed Kashmir region, days after his administration brokered a ceasefire between the two nuclear-armed rivals.“I will work with you, both to see if, after a ‘thousand years,’ a solution can be arrived at concerning Kashmir,” Trump posted on his Truth Social platform on Sunday.The US president doubled down on a historically inaccurate assertion that India and Pakistan have been fighting for “a thousand years” or more.The Muslim-majority territory has been contested since the partition of British India in 1947 into India and Pakistan. The two countries have fought three wars over the region. They both stake a claim over Kashmir as a whole but control parts of it.India-administered Kashmir has seen decades of armed rebellion either for independence or a merger with Pakistan. New Delhi has deployed more than 700,000 soldiers to quash the rebellion.The government of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has so far remained committed to a decades-old policy of refusing international mediation to find a solution to the Kashmir issue. In 2019, Modi’s government stripped India-administered Kashmir’s semiautonomy, further alienating the Kashmiris.In its response, Pakistan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement on Sunday that it appreciates Trump’s willingness to resolve the Kashmir issue, which has implications for peace and security in South Asia and beyond.“Pakistan reaffirms that any just and lasting settlement of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute must be in accordance with the relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions and must ensure the realization of the fundamental rights of the Kashmiri people, including their inalienable right to self-determination,” it said.India’s leaders have not directly commented, but Indian media quoted unnamed government sources as saying no decision has yet been made to engage in talks on anything beyond the ceasefire.India and Pakistan agreed to halt all fighting on Saturday, but Trump was the first person to announce the deal on his online platform.In his post on Sunday, Trump took credit for the ceasefire.“I am proud that the USA was able to help you arrive at this historic and heroic decision,” he wrote.“While not even discussed, I am going to increase trade, substantially, with both of these great nations.”The latest fighting between the two neighbours started when India attacked Pakistan in the aftermath of a shooting attack in India-administered Kashmir’s Pahalgam, which killed 26 civilians at a tourist location.New Delhi again accused Pakistan of backing the “terrorist” groups that have launched many deadly attacks in India-administered Kashmir for decades.Pakistan strongly denies the charges, maintaining that India has supported “terrorism” in its territory for many years and the Pahalgam attack was a false-flag operation to start a war.The missile, drone and artillery attacks signified the most serious fighting between the two countries since they became nuclear-armed powers decades ago.US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Saturday that in addition to the ceasefire, the two countries agreed to conduct broad talks over a host of issues at a “neutral” site soon.Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Saturday said his country believes in the path of peaceful negotiations to resolve problems around distribution of water resources and “all issues, including Jammu and Kashmir”.But India has for decades refused to hold negotiations over the contested region as it has tried to strengthen its hold over it.Mohmad Waseem Malla, a research fellow at the International Centre for Peace Studies in New Delhi, told Al Jazeera that Trump’s statement, though not entirely surprising, was “striking both in tone and substance” and likely to raise concerns in New Delhi.“Any suggestion of third-party involvement, even in passing, crosses a red line for New Delhi – especially under the current government, which has redefined the country’s foreign policy and its emphasis on territorial sovereignty.”He added that while Trump’s mention of boosting trade and promoting peace may seem conciliatory internationally, India’s domestic political climate and strategic priorities make it difficult to entertain such offers right now.“The key will be how New Delhi calibrates its response given current sensitivities.”The two countries also have yet to resolve their differences over water distribution as India’s suspension of its participation in the Indus Waters Treaty remains in place.In response to the Pahalgam attack, India also expelled Pakistani diplomats, military advisers and visa holders; closed its main land border crossing and suspended trade; and launched a manhunt for the perpetrators.Pakistan responded by kicking out Indian officials and citizens, closing its airspace to Indian flights and threatening to pull out of the Simla Agreement, which underpins the Line of Control in Kashmir.",Operation Sindoor,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/11/trump-offers-to-work-with-india-pakistan-on-kashmir,AL JAZEERA,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""framing"", ""reason"": ""The article frames Trump's offer to work on Kashmir as a 'solution' and implies that India has been unwilling to engage in negotiations, while presenting Pakistan's stance as more conciliatory."", ""confidence"": 0.8}",yes,framing," frames Trump's offer to work on Kashmir as a 'solution' and implies that India has been unwilling to engage in negotiations, while presenting Pakistan's stance as more conciliatory."
293,‘We’re cursed’: Kashmiris under attack across India after Pahalgam killings,"New Delhi, India – Walking through the narrow and crowded lanes of Jalandhar, a city in the northern state of Punjab, *Aasif Dar suddenly realised that “all eyes were on me”.And they weren’t friendly gazes.“I felt like every single person in the crowd had vengeance in their eyes,” recalled Dar.As Dar and a friend stopped by an ATM,  two unknown persons approached them, asking about their ethnicity. They panicked and ran away. The next morning, on April 23, Dar left his house to buy milk. “Three men saw me and hurled Islamophobic slurs,” said Dar. “One of them shouted, ‘He is a Kashmiri, everything happens because of them.’”On Tuesday, April 22, gunmen opened fire on tourists in Kashmir’s resort town of Pahalgam, killing 26 tourists and injuring a dozen others.Yet, even as New Delhi has blamed Pakistan for the attack, which was claimed by an armed group seeking secession from India, the killings have also opened up the country’s religious and ethnic fault lines.As Indian government forces continue to hunt for the attackers in Kashmir’s dense jungles and mountains, Kashmiris living across India, especially students, have reported heckling, harassment and threats by far-right Hindu groups – or even their classmates.From Uttarakhand, Punjab, to Uttar Pradesh, landlords are pushing Kashmiri tenants out; and shopkeepers are refusing to trade with them. Several Kashmiri students are sleeping at airports as they try to make their way home.Someone else carried out the deadly attack. “And we are now left here to pay the price,” said Dar.The disputed region of Kashmir is claimed in full, but ruled in parts, by both India and Pakistan.New Delhi has accused Islamabad of indirect involvement in “cross-border terrorism” and the Pahalgam attack. Pakistan refutes the allegations and says it only provides moral and diplomatic support to Kashmiri nationalism. It has said that India has not provided any evidence of Pakistan’s involvement in the Pahalgam attack, which has left the nuclear-armed neighbours locked in a tense standoff: New Delhi has walked out of a water-sharing treaty; both nations are expelling each other’s citizens and are scaling back the diplomatic strengths of their missions in each other’s capitals.But inside India, Kashmiris are bearing the brunt of the anger over Tuesday’s attack.Nearly a dozen Kashmiris who spoke with Al Jazeera, all on condition of anonymity, said they have locked themselves inside their rooms in at least seven cities of India, and avoid any outside contact, including placing online orders or booking cabs.Dar is a second-semester student of anaesthesia and operation theatre technology in Jalandhar. It is the first time Dar has left his parents, and Kashmir, to pursue higher education.“There are no opportunities in Kashmir, and I want to study hard for my future,” he said in a phone interview. “If I do well here, I will be able to support my family.”But the reality is sobering for him. With his term exams breathing down his neck, Dar said he has grown anxious and depressed. “I have forgotten everything that I have learnt in these months,” he said. “There is a constant uncertainty – I may stay non-attendant [at class]; go back to my home, I don’t know, my head just does not work.”“There is mistrust everywhere I look,” he said. “We are also cursed because our face and features give away our ethnicity.”Soon after the attack, multiple survivor accounts emerged, suggesting that the gunmen separated the attacked tourists by religion. Of the 26 people killed, 25 were Hindu men.But largely missed in the tornado of anti-Kashmiri and anti-Muslim hate that has taken over Indian social media since Tuesday, was the identity of the 26th person killed: a Kashmiri Muslim man who tried to stop the attackers from murdering the tourists.“Today’s India runs high on xenophobic propaganda and that has been unleashed for some years now; most of it is against Muslims,” said Sheikh Showkat, a political analyst and academic based in Kashmir.“Kashmiris bear a double weight: of being a Kashmiri – and a Muslim,” he said. “They are always the easy targets.”Nearly 350km (217 miles) away from Jalandhar, in Dehradun, the capital of Uttarakhand state, the leader of a far-right Hindutva outfit issued a chilling warning on Tuesday.“We won’t wait for the government to take action … Kashmiri Muslims, leave by 10am, else you will face action you can’t imagine,” Lalit Sharma, the leader of the Hindu Raksha Dal said in a video statement. “Tomorrow, all our workers will leave their homes to give this treatment to Kashmiri Muslims.”Similar warnings were soon hitting the social media feed of *Mushtaq Wani, a 29-year-old Kashmiri student in the city.Pursuing his master’s in library science, Wani, who is older than most Kashmiri students in the city, started receiving panicked calls from others. “We took the threats seriously,” he said.There is a history of violence against Kashmiris in the region: soon after the deadly suicide bombing attack in 2019 in Pulwama, which killed at least 40 paramilitary personnel, Kashmiri students were hunted down in Dehradun, beaten up, and forced back home. Several did not return to the city.“This is what our life is like,” Wani lamented. “This happens again and again – why cannot India finish the militants in one go? They have so many troopers and the [number of] militants [is] so less … someone kills someone and our lives are upended.”Since the threats, Wani has coordinated at least 15 students’ travel back to Kashmir. As for himself, he is sitting tight, locked inside a friend’s home, preparing for his term exams from next week. “We are scared and do not feel safe, but if I miss my exams, I stand to lose a lot,” he said.However, Wani said, he felt a little relieved after the police arrested Sharma, the far-right leader, and assured Kashmiri students that authorities would ensure their safety.After videos of frightened Kashmiris, and of their physical assault in nearly half a dozen Indian cities, hit social media, Omar Abdullah, the newly elected chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir, urged other state chiefs on X to ensure the safety of Kashmiris.“I request the people of India not to consider the people of Kashmir as their enemies,” Abdullah later told reporters. “What happened did not take place with our consent. We are not the enemies.”In 2019, the Indian government unilaterally revoked the region’s semi-autonomous status and divided the former state into two union territories – Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh – amid a communications blackout. Even though Abdullah came to power last year after the first state legislature elections in a decade, the Jammu and Kashmir government today has far less power than any other provincial administration, with New Delhi largely in charge.*Umer Parray, a resident of south Kashmir, has been studying pharmacy in Jammu for five years. Muslim-majority Kashmir and Hindu-majority Jammu are two administrative blocks of the union territory.Until Pahalgam, life had been fine in Jammu, he said. “But the Pahalgam attack changed everything,” he said.Earlier, Parray would go on late-night walks with friends to ice cream shops. Since the attack, Parray has not left his home in a neighbourhood where many Kashmiri residents live.The night after the attack, dozens of young men rode through the neighbourhood on bikes – blaring horns and shouting “Jai Shri Ram”, historically a religious chant and greeting that far-right groups have, in recent years, turned into a war cry.Later, a video emerged of men beating and running after Kashmiri students in his adjacent lane.“We have never seen anything like this,” he said.Beaten for being Kashmiri muslim, a  Kashmiri student was thrashed by mob in Janipur, Jammu last night.

294,India top general admits aerial ‘losses’ in recent conflict with Pakistan,"India’s chief of defence staff says the country suffered initial losses in the air during a recent military conflict with neighbouring Pakistan, but declined to give details.“What was important is, why did these losses occur, and what we will do after that,” General Anil Chauhan told the Reuters news agency on Saturday on the sidelines of the Shangri-La Dialogue security forum in Singapore.India and Pakistan were engaged in a four-day conflict this month, their worst standoff since 1999, before a ceasefire was agreed on May 10. More than 70 people were killed in missile, drone and artillery fire on both sides, but there are competing claims on the casualties.India says more than 100 “terrorists” were killed in its “precision strikes” on several “terror camps” across Pakistan, which rejects the claim, saying more than 30 Pakistani civilians were killed in the Indian attacks.New Delhi, meanwhile, says nearly two dozen civilians were killed on the Indian side, most of them in Indian-administered Kashmir, along the disputed border.The fighting between the two nuclear powers was triggered by an attack on tourists in Pahalgam in Indian-administered Kashmir on April 22 that killed 26 people, almost all of them tourists. New Delhi blamed Pakistan for supporting the armed group behind the attack, an allegation Islamabad denied.During their conflict, Pakistan had also claimed to have downed at least five Indian military jets, including at least three Rafale fighters. But Chauhan on Saturday dismissed it as “absolutely incorrect”, confirming his country had lost at least one aircraft.“I think what is important is that, not the jet being down, but why they were being down,” he told Bloomberg TV in a separate interview in Singapore.On May 11, a day after the ceasefire, India’s Air Marshal AK Bharti told reporters in New Delhi that “all our pilots are back home”, adding that “we are in a combat scenario, and that losses are a part of combat”.Chauhan said on Saturday India switched tactics after suffering losses in the air on the first day of conflict and established a decisive advantage.“So we rectified tactics and then went back on the [May] 7th, 8th and 10th in large numbers to hit airbases deep inside Pakistan, penetrated all their air defences with impunity, carried out precision strikes,” he said.Islamabad has denied it suffered any losses of planes but has acknowledged its airbases suffered some hits, although losses were minimal.Chauhan said while the fighting had ceased, the Indian government had made it clear that it would respond “precisely and decisively should there be any further terror attacks emanating from Pakistan”.“So that has its own dynamics as far [as] the armed forces are concerned. It will require us to be prepared 24/7,” he said.Chauhan also said that although Pakistan is closely allied with China, which borders India in the north and the northeast, there was no sign of any actual help from Beijing during the conflict.“While this was unfolding from [April] 22nd onwards, we didn’t find any unusual activity in the operational or tactical depth of our northern borders, and things were generally all right,” he told Reuters.Asked whether China may have provided any satellite imagery or other real-time intelligence to Pakistan during the conflict, Chauhan said such imagery was commercially available and could have been procured from China as well as other sources.",Operation Sindoor,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/31/india-top-general-admits-losses-in-recent-conflict-with-pakistan,AL JAZEERA,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""source"", ""reason"": ""The article relies heavily on General Anil Chauhan's statements to the Reuters news agency and Bloomberg TV, without providing a balanced view from Pakistani sources."", ""confidence"": 0.8}",no,none,no source bias
295,‘Attack on country’s soul’: Indian MPs target Pakistan on global trips,"Doha, Qatar – Inside India’s Parliament, they are sworn rivals, with the opposition raising questions and attacking the government over its policies, and the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) of Prime Minister Narendra Modi defending itself – and the two sides rarely meet.Over the past few days, however, they have. Their shared concern: national security allegedly threatened by neighbouring Pakistan.A team of Indian Parliament members, including many opposition legislators, visited Qatar over the past four days as part of a broader diplomatic outreach by New Delhi to try to shape global opinion in the aftermath of the most intense military confrontation between the South Asian neighbours since 1999.New Delhi blames Islamabad for the killing of 26 people — most of them tourists — in Indian-administered Kashmir’s resort town of Pahalgam on April 22, which led to days of exchange of missiles and drone explosives between the two nuclear powers, before they agreed to a ceasefire.Pakistan has rejected India’s allegations.“India has been hurt by an unprecedented attack on India’s soul, the attack that happened in Pahalgam, which has shaken every Indian,” said Supriya Sule, a parliamentarian from the opposition Nationalist Congress Party, who led the team of Indian MPs visiting Doha.Her team is one of seven dispatched by the Modi government to more than 30 countries on an “outreach programme” to “sensitise” other governments on Pakistan’s alleged support to “terror groups” accused of carrying out several deadly attacks in Kashmir and other parts of India for decades. The delegations consist of MPs and retired diplomats.Sule’s team landed in the Qatari capital on Saturday night and held discussions with the Gulf state’s officials for two days before heading to South Africa on Tuesday. The MPs will also visit Ethiopia and Egypt.Addressing reporters during a news conference held by the Indian delegation in a seaside hotel in Doha on Monday, Sule said their aim is to “create a global opinion” against Pakistan. She insisted there was “enough evidence” linking Pakistan to the Pahalgam killings, in which the attackers picked out men and then identified them by religion before shooting them dead.The Pahalgam attack, the deadliest on tourists in the disputed Kashmir region in decades, was claimed by The Resistance Front (TRF), a relatively unknown group that Indian agencies say acts as a front for Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), a Pakistan-based armed group.India accuses Pakistan of using groups like the LeT to support an armed secessionist movement in Indian-administered Kashmir. Multiple governments, including the United States and India, also accuse the LeT and other Pakistan-based armed groups of carrying out attacks in Indian cities, far from Kashmir.“We do not differentiate between a terrorist state and a terrorist,” Rajiv Pratap Rudy, BJP MP and former federal minister, said during the news conference, stressing that the delegation is “preventive diplomacy” that seeks to unite the world against “terror”.Pakistan says it provides only diplomatic and moral support to the Kashmiri separatist movement. And though it accepts that the 2008 Mumbai attacks, in which more than 160 people were killed, might have been planned from Pakistan, it insists that the country’s government and military had no role.India and Pakistan both control parts of Kashmir, while China also administers two slivers of the region. India claims all of Kashmir, while Pakistan claims the part controlled by India, but not the territory held by China, its ally.Manish Tewari, a parliamentarian from the opposition Congress party and former federal minister, told Al Jazeera the objective of the Indian delegations is to tell the world that Pakistan “continues to be the epicentre of global terrorism”.“India does not make a distinction between the semi-state actors and the state which spawns that. Over the past four and a half decades, there is documented evidence provided to the international community – and to Pakistan – that terror emanates from their soil,” he said.In the days after the ceasefire, some critics of the Modi government — including a senior Congress leader whose comments were carried in an Indian news outlet last week — have questioned New Delhi’s diplomacy over the crisis. Though India insists that the truce was reached bilaterally, US President Donald Trump has repeatedly insisted that he and his administration brokered the ceasefire.India, as a matter of policy, has long argued that its disputes with Pakistan are purely bilateral and that there is no space for third-party intervention. India has also long tried to build its relations with the world, independent of India-Pakistan tensions. Critics have argued that Trump’s comments and the recent crisis have undermined both of those Indian positions.But asked about criticism from the Congress leader that all-party delegations were being flown across the world as a “damage-control exercise” after India got “hyphenated” with Pakistan, risking the internationalisation of the Kashmir issue, Tewari replied: “Absolutely not.”“Each party has its own ideology, perspective and views. At the same time, there has been no two voices on the condemnation [of what happened in Pahalgam and subsequent Indian action],” Anand Sharma, another Congress MP and former federal minister, told Al Jazeera.“We are in complete solidarity with the decisions the government has made,” he added.Asked about the visit to Doha, Sule said the Qatari government stands with India in its “zero tolerance to terrorism”.“The response of Qatari officials to our submissions has been very encouraging,” added Rudy.Syed Akbaruddin, a former diplomat who was once India’s permanent representative to the United Nations, is also a member of the Indian delegation. When Al Jazeera asked him whether their plan to attack Pakistan on global platforms risks making Kashmir a multilateral issue, he said, “Disputes are normal between countries.”“What we object to is this use of subterranean methods of terror to try and push an agenda which you’re not able to do through conventional methods, and that is a problem,” he added.“What we see terrorism doing is not merely killing people, killing people is one part of it, but it is aimed at undermining our social harmony, it aims to stop our economic momentum, and it is focused on undermining our democratic ethos.”Anurag Thakur, a BJP parliamentarian and former federal minister, also said Kashmir remains a bilateral issue between the two South Asian neighbours.“Kashmir is between India and Pakistan. We are very clear on that,” he told Al Jazeera.",Operation Sindoor,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/27/attack-on-countrys-soul-indian-mps-target-pakistan-on-global-trips,AL JAZEERA,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""labeling"", ""reason"": ""Loaded labels/titles ('Attack on country’s soul') applied asymmetrically or without parity across actors."", ""confidence"": 0.8}",yes,labelling,labels/titles ('Attack on country’s soul') applied asymmetrically or without parity across actors
296,‘Traitors’: Hate-filled songs target Indian Muslims after Kashmir attack,"Mumbai, India – Less than 24 hours after news broke of the April 22 attack, in which gunmen killed 25 tourists and a local pony rider in the Indian-administered Kashmir region, a new song surfaced on Indian YouTube.Its message was unmistakable:We made a mistake by allowing you to stay on,You got your own country, why didn’t you leave then?They call us Hindus “kaffirs”,Their hearts are full of conspiracies against us.The song, titled “Pehle Dharam Pocha” (They Asked About Religion First) targeted Indian Muslims, insisted they were conspiring against Hindus and asked them to leave India. In less than a week, the song has garnered more than 140,000 views on YouTube.And it is not the only song. The killings in the picturesque resort town of Pahalgam marked the worst attack against tourists in Kashmir in a quarter of a century. But even as New Delhi hits back against Pakistan, which it accuses of links to the attack – a charge Islamabad denies – a wave of incendiary music tracks, crafted and circulated within hours, has set off an anti-Muslim backlash in India.Set to pulsing beats and catchy rhymes, these songs, part of a genre that has come to be known as Hindutva Pop, are calling for violent retribution for the attack. From songs that label Indian Muslims as “traitors” to songs that advocate their boycott, the country’s smartphones are buzzing. Hindutva is the Hindu majoritarian political ideology of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its allies.Al Jazeera found at least 20 songs that carried and amplified such Islamophobic themes at a time when Indians were anxiously scrolling through their digital feeds for more information on the aftermath of the attack.These songs have a chillingly consistent narrative: Since the attackers are believed to have singled out Hindu tourists, Indian Muslims can no longer be trusted – never mind that a Muslim Kashmiri pony rider who tried to stop the gunmen was also killed.Apart from these, a glut of other hyper-nationalist songs has also emerged in the past week, pushing warmongering rhetoric deeper into Indian digital veins. There are songs that call for Pakistan to be nuked or for the Indian government to “wipe Pakistan off the map”, and others that advocate for “Pakistani blood” in exchange for the deaths,These songs have become a part of a broader digital push by Hindutva groups, who are using social media and encrypted platforms like WhatsApp to stoke fear, hatred, and division among Indians – all at a time when tensions with neighbouring Pakistan are ratcheting up.This campaign is mirroring real-world violence, across multiple Indian states. In Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Maharashtra and Uttarakhand, Muslims have faced brutal attacks and threats. Kashmiri Muslims have been evicted from their homes, street vendors assaulted, and in chilling acts of retribution, Muslim patients have been denied medical care by Hindu doctors.On Friday, a Muslim man was shot dead, with a Hindu supremacist in Agra, Uttar Pradesh, claiming responsibility for the shooting and saying it was retribution for the Pahalgam attack.All the 20 songs that Al Jazeera analysed saw a common theme being pushed: a reiteration of the assertion that tourists were killed for their Hindu identities, and therefore, Hindus across the country must now feel threatened in living around Muslims. Multiple witness and survivor accounts of the Pahalgam attack suggest that the gunmen asked the tourists to recite the Kalimas (sacred Islamic verses) and the men who could not do so were shot.The song Pehle Dharm Poocha (They Asked About Religion First) was released on April 23, the day after the attack. Singer Kavi Singh insists that letting Muslims stay on in India after the country’s partition in 1947 was “a mistake”, and asks them to go to Pakistan.Another song, Ab Ek Nahi Huye Toh Kat Jaaoge (If You Don’t Unite Now You Will be Slaughtered), by singer Chandan Deewana, is addressed entirely to Hindus, asking them to rise up and “save our religion”. The song insists that Hindus, not Indians, are under threat and warns that they will be “slaughtered” if they do not unite. It has garnered more than 60,000 views on YouTube in just two days.Jaago Hindu Jaago (Wake Up, Hindus) is a song that asks Hindus to identify “traitors within the country”, a coded reference to Muslims. The song’s video on YouTube contains an AI-re-enactment of the Pahalgam attack and has more than 128,000 views so far.Another song, Modi Ji Ab Maha Yudh Ho Jaane Do (Modi ji, Let The Great War Begin), refers to Muslims as “snakes” living in India. Another song calls the events in the country a “religious war”, and yet another asks for Hindus in India to be allowed to carry arms.These songs provide a background score for social media posts that bear similar themes.From AI-generated videos and memes recreating the attack to Ghibli images, social media timelines have seen a flood of content emerging from the attack. Much of it carries similar undertones: to paint the attack as an assault on Hindus and the Hindu religion, while exhorting Hindus to “unite” against the threat of Muslims.Some posts liken the Pahalgam killings to the October 7, 2023, attacks on Israel by Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups, and exhort the Indian government to “take revenge the Israel way”. Israel launched a war on the Gaza Strip that has, since October 2023, killed more than 52,000 Palestinians and wounded more than 117,000 others.Raqib Hameed Naik, the executive director of the Washington, DC-based Center for the Study of Organized Hate (CSOH), which tracks hate speech in India, said the centre has observed “a sharp spike” in anti-Muslim rhetoric on social media since the Kashmir attack.“The [Muslim] community is frequently portrayed as an existential threat through memes, AI-generated images, videos and misinformation, systematically designed to inflame passions and justify exclusionary rhetoric,” Naik said.In addition to the 20 songs that Al Jazeera identified, there is a plethora of songs on YouTube abusing Pakistan (one song’s title is “Pakistan, You M***********”, and it has garnered more than 75,000 views). The videos accompanying some of these songs feature military simulation videos of air strikes, soldiers in combat and tanks firing munitions.Some of them even feature the singers dressed in military fatigues and camouflage face paint, with one singer holding a rifle throughout the video.Since the Kashmir attack, there have been multiple incidents of violence on the streets, targeting Kashmiri and other Muslims across the country.The Association For Protection Of Civil Rights (APCR), a civil rights advocacy group consisting of lawyers and human rights activists, has recorded 21 incidents of anti-Muslim violence, intimidation and hate speech across the country in the days after April 22.These include assaulting Kashmiri women and students, delivering hate speeches against Muslims in public rallies and asking the Indian government to replicate Israel’s actions in Palestine against Kashmiris – as well as evicting Kashmiri students from their rented homes and hostels.“Indians are being bombarded by this hateful campaign, which uses the attack as a base,” said Nadeem Khan, the general secretary of APCR. “This campaign has taken the country’s temperature to its boiling point.”APCR, he said, was now in the process of arranging legal aid for victims of the post-attack violence.Members of Modi’s BJP have been linked to some of the hate speech and violence.One BJP minister in the western state of Maharashtra, Nitesh Rane, called for an economic boycott of Muslims, while addressing a public event attended by hundreds last week. “If they are behaving this way about religion, then why should we buy things from them and make them rich? You people will have to take a pledge that whenever you make any purchase, you should buy it only from a Hindu,” Rane told the gathering.Another BJP legislator entered Jaipur city’s Jama Masjid and pasted offensive posters inside the premises of a mosque, during a protest against Pakistan for its involvement in the Kashmir attack. A group of BJP leaders in Mumbai were booked by the police for abusing and assaulting Muslim hawkers in central Mumbai.In addition, leaders of the BJP as well as its ideological affiliates, the Bajrang Dal and the Vishwa Hindu Parishad, have also been organising protests against Pakistan, often indulging in anti-Muslim hate speeches in the process.The Washington DC-based CSOH has recorded at least 10 hate speech events since April 22, where participants have threatened Muslims with violence, advocated for a boycott of Muslims, asked Hindus to arm themselves and even warned Kashmiri Muslims to leave, failing which they would “face consequences”.Naik, from CSOH, said that the online hate campaign against Muslims had sought to “justify” this violence.“This follows a longstanding pattern where certain domestic or international incidents are weaponised to demonise Muslims and promote hate and violence against them in India,” he said.",Operation Sindoor,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/4/29/traitors-hate-filled-songs-target-indian-muslims-after-kashmir-attack,AL JAZEERA,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""tonality"", ""reason"": ""The article's tone is consistently critical and condemnatory of the hate-filled songs and rhetoric targeting Indian Muslims, using words like 'hate-filled', 'incendiary', 'Islamophobic', and 'violent retribution'.

297,‘Who suffered the most?’: Fear and fatigue in Kashmir after ceasefire,"Srinagar, Indian-administered Kashmir — On Saturday morning at Fateh Kadal, a densely packed neighbourhood on the sloping embankment of the Jhelum River in Srinagar, Indian-administered Kashmir’s largest city, 62-year-old Hajira wrapped a cotton scarf with a brown paisley design around her shoulders.With her face muscles tense and sweat beading across her upper lip, she sat on the cement floor of a government-run grains store.“Can you make it quick?” she called to the person manning the store.Hajira comes to the store every month to submit her biometric details, as required by the government to secure the release of her monthly quota of subsidised grains, which her family of four depends on.But this time was different. The past few days have been unprecedented for residents of Indian-administered Kashmir. Drones hovered overhead, airports were shut down, explosions rang out, people were killed in cross-border fire, and the region prepared for the possibility of an all-out war.“He made me stand in the queue,” she said, flinching from knee pain, referring to the store operator. “But there’s uncertainty around. I just want my share of rice so I can quickly return. A war is coming.”Then, on Saturday evening, Hajira breathed a sigh of relief. United States President Donald Trump announced that he had succeeded in mediating a ceasefire between India and Pakistan.“I thank God for this,” Hajira said, smiling sheepishly. “Perhaps he understood that I didn’t have the means to endure the financial hardship that a war-like situation would have caused.”On Sunday morning, Trump went a step further, saying in a post on his Truth Social platform that he would try to work with India and Pakistan to resolve their longstanding dispute over Kashmir, a region both countries partly control but claim in its entirety.Political analyst Zafar Choudhary, based in the city of Jammu in southern Kashmir, told Al Jazeera that New Delhi would not be happy about Trump’s statement. India has long argued that Pakistan-sponsored “terrorism” is the primary reason for tensions between the nuclear-armed neighbours.However, “Trump’s offer underlines the fact that Kashmir remains central to India-Pakistan confrontations”, Choudhary said.And for Kashmiris, the hope stemming from the fragile pause in fighting between India and Pakistan, and Trump’s offer to mediate talks on Kashmir, is tempered by scepticism borne from a decades-long, desperate wait for peace.Hundreds of thousands of Kashmiris stood in the direct line of fire between India and Pakistan in recent days.As the neighbouring nations launched missiles and drones at each other, Kashmiri communities near the Line of Control (LoC), the de facto border with Pakistan, also witnessed cross-border shelling on a scale unseen in decades, triggering an exodus of people towards safer locations.The shadow of conflict has stalked their lives for nearly four decades, since an armed rebellion first erupted against the Indian government in the late 1980s. Then, in 2019, the government scrapped Kashmir’s semi-autonomous status amid a huge security crackdown – thousands of people were imprisoned.On April 22, a brutal attack by gunmen on tourists at Pahalgam killed 26 civilians, shattering the normalcy critics had accused India of projecting in the disputed region.Since then, in addition to a diplomatic tit-for-tat and missile exchanges with Pakistan, the Indian government has intensified its crackdown on the armed groups active in Kashmir.It has demolished the homes of rebels accused of links to the Pahalgam attack, raided other homes across the region and detained approximately 2,800 people, 90 of whom have been booked under the Public Safety Act, a draconian preventive detention law. The police also summoned many journalists and arrested at least one for “promoting secessionist ideology”.By Sunday, while a sense of jubilation swept through the region over the ceasefire, many people were still cautious, doubtful even, about whether the truce brokered by Trump would hold.Just hours after both countries declared a cessation of hostilities, loud explosions rang out in major urban centres across Kashmir as a swarm of kamikaze drones from Pakistan raced across the airspace.Many residents raced to the terraces of their apartments and homes to capture videos of the drones being brought down by India’s defence systems, a trail of bright red dots arcing across the night sky before exploding midair.As part of the emergency protocols, the authorities turned off the electricity supply. Fearing that the debris from drones would fall on them, residents ran for safety. The surge of drones through the night skies also touched off sirens, triggering a sense of dread.“I don’t think I have ever been more frightened before,” said Hasnain Shabir, a 24-year-old business graduate from Srinagar. “The streets have been robbed of all their life. If the prelude to war looks like this, I don’t know what war will look like.”Hours after the ceasefire was announced on Saturday, India accused Pakistan of violating it by shelling border regions. Residents across major towns in Kashmir were on their toes, once again, after drones reappeared in the skies.One of the worst-affected places in Kashmir during these days is Uri, a picturesque town of pear orchards and walnut groves close to India’s contested border with Pakistan.The village is surrounded by majestic mountains through which the Jhelum flows. It is the final frontier on the Indian-administered side before the hills pave the way to Pakistan-administered Kashmir.Parts of Uri saw intense shelling, forcing the residents to leave their homes and look for safety. On May 8, officials told Al Jazeera that a woman, Nargis Bashir, was killed in her car as she and her family tried to flee the border region, like thousands of others, after flying shrapnel tore through the vehicle. Three of her family members were wounded.Muhammad Naseer Khan, 60, a former serviceman, was huddling in his room when Pakistani artillery fire hit a nearby military post, with metal shards blasting through the walls of his house. “The blast has damaged one side of my home,” Khan said, wearing a traditional blue shirt and a tweed coat.“I don’t know if this place is even liveable,” he said, his bright blue eyes betraying a sense of fear.Despite the ceasefire, his two daughters and many others in his family who had left for a relative’s house, away from the disputed border, are sceptical about returning. “My children are refusing to return. They have no guarantee that guns won’t roar again,” he said.Suleman Sheikh, a 28-year-old resident in Uri, recalled his childhood years when his grandfather would talk about the Bofors artillery guns stationed inside a military garrison in the nearby village of Mohra.“He told us that the last time this gun had roared was in 1999, when India and Pakistan clashed on the icy peaks of Kargil. It is a conventional belief here that if this gun roared again, things are going to get too bad,” he said.That is what happened at 2am on May 8. As the Bofors guns in Mohra prepared to fire ammunition across the mountains into Pakistan, Sheikh felt the ground shaking beneath him. An hour and a half later, a shell fired from the other side hit an Indian paramilitary installation nearby, making a long hissing noise before striking with a thud.Hours after Sheikh spoke to Al Jazeera, another shell landed on his home. The rooms and the portico of his house collapsed, according to a video he shared with Al Jazeera later.He had refused to leave his home despite his family’s pleas to join them. “I was here to protect our livestock,” Sheikh said. “I didn’t want to leave them alone.”Unlike the rest of the Kashmir valley, where apple cultivation brings millions of dollars in income for the region, Uri is relatively poor. Villagers mostly work odd jobs for the Indian Army, which maintains large garrisons there, or farm walnuts and pears. Livestock rearing has turned into a popular vocation for many in the town.“We have the firsthand experience of what war feels like. It is good that the ceasefire has taken place. But I don’t know if it will hold or not,” Sheikh said, his face downcast. “I pray that it does.”Back in Srinagar, residents are slowly returning to the rhythm of their daily lives. Schools and colleges remain closed, and people are avoiding unnecessary travel.The scenes of racing drone fleets in the skies and the accompanying blasts are seared into public memory. “Only in the evening will we come to know whether this ceasefire has held on,” said Muskaan Wani, a student of medicine at Government Medical College, Srinagar, on Sunday.It did, overnight, but the tension over whether it will last remains.Political experts attribute the general scepticism about the ceasefire to the unresolved political issues in the region – a point that was echoed in Trump’s statement on Sunday, in which he referred to a possible “solution concerning Kashmir”.“The problem to begin with is the political alienation [of Kashmiris],” said Noor Ahmad Baba, a former professor and head of the political science department at the University of Kashmir.“People in Kashmir feel humiliated for what has happened to them in the last few years, and there haven’t been any significant efforts to win them over. When there’s humiliation, there is suspicion.”Others in Indian-administered Kashmir expressed their anger at both countries for ruining their lives.“I doubt that our feelings as Kashmiris even matter,” said Furqan, a software engineer in Srinagar who gave his first name only. “Two nuclear powers fought, caused damage and casualties at the borders, gave their respective nations a spectacle to watch, their goals were achieved, and then they stopped the war.“But the question is, who suffered the most? It’s us. For the world, we are nothing but collateral damage.”Furqan said his friends were sceptical about the ceasefire when the two countries resumed shelling on the evening of May 10.“We all already were like, ‘It is not gonna last,'” he said. “And then we heard the explosions again.”Muneeb Mehraj, a 26-year-old resident of Srinagar who studies management in the northern Indian state of Punjab, echoed Furqan.“For others, the war may be over. A ceasefire has been declared. But once again, it’s Kashmiris who have paid the price – lives lost, homes destroyed, peace shattered,” he said. “How long must this cycle continue?”“We are exhausted,” Mehraj continued. “We don’t want another temporary pause. We want a lasting, permanent solution.”",Operation Sindoor,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/12/we-want-permanent-solution-fear-and-fatigue-in-kashmir-after-ceasefire,AL JAZEERA,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""tonality"", ""reason"": ""The article's tone is sympathetic and critical of India's actions in Kashmir, using words like 'fear', 'fatigue', 'humiliation', and 'suffered the most' to describe the impact on Kashmiris."", ""confidence"": 0.8}",yes,tonality," tone is sympathetic and critical of India's actions in Kashmir, using words like 'fear', 'fatigue', 'humiliation', and 'suffered the most' to describe the impact on Kashmiris"
298,Indian court rules in favor of Hindu temple on disputed land,"NEW DELHI  — India's Supreme Court on Saturday ruled in favor of a Hindu temple on a disputed religious ground and ordered that alternative land be given to Muslims to build a mosque.The dispute over land ownership has been one of the country's most contentious issues.The 16th-century Babri Masjid mosque in northern Indian town of Ayodhya in Uttar Pradesh state was destroyed by Hindu hard-liners in December 1992, sparking massive Hindu-Muslim violence that left 2,000 people dead.JOURNALIST LOSES INDIAN CITIZENSHIP AFTER PIECE CRITICIZING PM MODIFive Supreme Court justices said in a unanimous judgment that 5 acres (2.02 hectares) of land will be allotted to the Muslim community at a prominent place for building a mosque. The disputed land will be given to a board of trustees for the construction of a temple for Hindu god Ram.Hindu supporters and activists celebrated the ruling on the court lawns, blowing bugles and chanting ""Jai Shree Ram,"" or hailing god Ram.Nirmohi Akhara leader Dharam Das, center, celebrates the verdict outside the Supreme Court in New Delhi, India, Saturday, Nov. 9, 2019. (Associated Press)An attorney representing the Muslims deplored the ruling.""We are not satisfied with the verdict and it's not up our expectation,"" said Zafaryab Jilani, who is representing the Muslim community's Babri Action committee.""We are not satisfied with the verdict and it's not up our expectation.""""These 5 acres of land don't mean anything to us,"" he said. ""We are examining the verdict and whatever legal course is open for us.""He hinted at filing a review petition in the Supreme Court challenging Saturday's verdict. At the same time, he appealed to members of all communities to maintain peace.Vishnu Shankar Jain, an attorney who represented the Hindu community, said the journey over several years had been a struggle.""It was a huge legal battle and we are happy that we convinced the Supreme Court. It's a historic moment for Hindus,"" he said.""It was a huge legal battle and we are happy that we convinced the Supreme Court. It's a historic moment for Hindus.""Raj Nath Singh, India's defense minister, appealed to all to ""accept the court verdict and maintain peace.""In Islamabad, Pakistan's foreign minister, Shah Mahmood Qureshi, criticized the verdict, saying it was indicative of the ""hate based mindset"" of the Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government.""This is nothing but Modi's government continued policies of cultivating seeds of hatred and promoting differences between the communities and religious segments of the population to achieve its designs,"" he said.Hindu hard-liners say they want to build a new temple to god Ram on the site, which they revere as his birthplace. They say the mosque was built after a temple dedicated to the Hindu god was destroyed by Muslim invaders.After the demolition of the mosque, Hindus and Muslims took the issue to a lower court, which in 2010 ruled that the disputed land should be divided into three parts — two for Hindus and one for Muslims.That was challenged in the Supreme Court by both communities.The five judges started daily proceedings in August after mediation failed to find a compromise.Modi had promised to build the temple in 2014 elections that brought him to power.

299,Millions in India celebrate as new Hindu temple is built on ruins of historic mosque,"Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday opened a controversial Hindu temple built on the ruins of a historic mosque in the northern city of Ayodhya, in a political triumph for the populist leader who is seeking to transform the country from a secular democracy into a Hindu state.The temple is dedicated to Hinduism’s Lord Ram and fulfills a long-standing demand by millions of Hindus who worship the revered deity and extoll him for the virtues of truth, sacrifice and ethical governance. Modi’s party and other Hindu nationalist groups who seized on the demand have portrayed the temple as central to their vision of reclaiming Hindu pride, which they say was suppressed by centuries of Mughal rule and British colonialism.Modi and his governing Bharatiya Janata Party hope that opening the temple will help catapult the prime minister to a record third successive term in elections expected this spring. But with the temple still under construction, critics accuse Modi of a hurried opening to woo voters.INDIA’S RELIGIOUS DIVIDE CONTINUES TO WIDEN BETWEEN MUSLIM, HINDU COMMUNITYModi, dressed in a traditional kurta tunic, led the opening ceremony as Hindu priests chanted hymns inside the temple’s inner sanctum, where a 1.3-meter (4.3-foot) stone sculpture of Lord Ram was installed last week. A conch was blown by a priest to mark the temple’s opening and Modi placed a lotus flower in front of the black stone idol, decked in intricate gold ornaments and holding a golden bow and arrow. He later prostrated before the idol.An audience is seen during the opening of a temple dedicated to Hindu deity Lord Ram in Ayodhya, India, on Jan. 22, 2024. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has opened a Hindu temple built on the ruins of a historic mosque in the holy city of Ayodhya, aiming to rally voters in an upcoming election.Nearly 7,500 people, including elite industrialists, politicians and movie stars, witnessed the ritual on a giant screen outside the temple as a military helicopter showered flower petals.""Our Lord Ram has arrived after centuries of wait,"" Modi said in a speech after the ceremony, receiving a resounding applause from thousands of attendees. He said the temple was built after ""countless sacrifices"" and is testament to a rising India ""breaking the shackles of slave mentality.""""Jan. 22, 2024, is not merely a date but marks the dawn of a new era,"" Modi said.RELIGIOUS TRADITIONS LEAD TO CONSERVATION EFFORTS FOR SACRED FORESTS IN INDIAModi's government turned the event into a national occasion by organizing live screenings across the country and closing offices for half a day. Saffron flags — the color of Hinduism — adorned the streets of various cities where government party workers had gone door to door handing out religious pamphlets.Television news channels ran non-stop coverage of the event, portrayed as a religious spectacle. Some movie theaters broadcast the event live with complimentary popcorn. Many states declared the day a public holiday. In a rare step, stock and money markets were closed for the day.""Ram Rajya (rule) begins,"" a TV news headline said. Ram Rajya is a Sankrit phrase that means just and ethical governance in Hinduism but has also been used by Hindu nationalists to signify Hindu domination in an officially secular India.Modi has been the face of an unprecedented and unapologetic fusion of religion and politics in India. Ahead of the temple opening, he set the tone by visiting numerous Ram temples over 11 days as part of a Hindu ritual.Analysts and critics see Monday’s ceremony as the start of the election campaign for Modi, an avowed Hindu nationalist and one of India’s most consequential leaders. They say the pomp-filled display led by the government shows the extent to which the line between religion and state has eroded under Modi.""Prime ministers prior to Modi have also been to temples, been to other places of worship, but they went there as devotees. This is the first time that he went there as somebody who performed the ritual,"" said Nilanjan Mukhopadhyay, an expert in Hindu nationalism and author of a book on Modi.The temple, located at one of India’s most vexed religious sites, is expected to embolden Modi’s chances of returning to power by drawing on the religious sentiments of Hindus, who make up 80% of India’s population of 1.4 billion.Ayodhya, once crowded with tightly packed houses and rundown stalls, has undergone an elaborate makeover in the lead up to the temple's inauguration. Narrow roads have been turned into a four-lane pilgrimage route leading to the temple, tourists are arriving at a new airport and sprawling railway station, and major hotel chains are building new properties.Jubilant devotees from across the country have arrived to celebrate the opening, with groups of them dancing to religious songs that blare from speakers on roads bedecked with flowers. Huge cut-outs of Lord Ram and billboards of Modi are ubiquitous across Ayodhya, where the borders have been sealed to prevent more people from coming in. Some 20,000 security personnel and more than 10,000 security cameras have been deployed.The moment will be remembered as momentous and historic by many of the country’s Hindu citizens.""I am here to see history unfolding before our eyes. For centuries, the story of Lord Ram has resonated in the hearts of millions,"" said Harish Joshi who arrived in Ayodhya from Uttarakhand state four days before the ceremony.Built at an estimated cost of $217 million and spread over nearly 3 hectares (7.4 acres), the temple lies atop the debris of the 16th-century Babri Mosque, which was razed to the ground in 1992 by Hindu mobs who believed it was built on temple ruins marking the birthplace of Lord Ram.The site has long been a religious flashpoint for the two communities, with the demolition of the mosque triggering bloody riots across India that killed 2,000 people, mostly Muslims.The dispute ended in 2019 when, in a controversial decision, India’s Supreme Court called the mosque’s destruction ""an egregious violation"" of the law but granted the site to Hindus while giving Muslims a different plot of land.The fraught history is still an open wound for many Muslims, who have increasingly come under attack in recent years by Hindu nationalist groups and see the construction of the temple as a testament to Modi’s Hindu-first politics.Officials say the temple, a three-story structure made of pink sandstone, will open to the public after the ceremony and they expect 100,000 devotees to visit daily. Builders are still working to finish 46 elaborate doors and intricate wall carvings.NEW JERSEY OPENS LARGEST HINDU TEMPLE OUTSIDE INDIABut not all are rejoicing. Four key Hindu religious authorities refused to attend, saying consecrating an unfinished temple goes against Hindu scriptures. Some top leaders from India’s main opposition Congress party also boycotted the event, with many opposition lawmakers accusing Modi of exploiting the temple for political points.Neighboring Pakistan condemned the consecration, saying a temple built on the site of a demolished mosque would remain a blot on India’s democracy.""There is a growing list of mosques (in India) facing a similar threat of desecration and destruction,"" Pakistan’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement. It urged the international community to help save Islamic heritage sites in India from ""extremist groups"" and ensure that minority rights are protected.At least three historical mosques in northern India are embroiled in court disputes overclaims by Hindu nationalists who say they were built over temple ruins.

(AP Photo)LUCKNOW, India – Tens of thousands of Hindus gathered in northern India on Sunday renewing calls to build a Hindu temple on a site where a 16th century mosque was attacked and demolished by Hindu hard-liners in 1992, sparking deadly Hindu-Muslim violence.The demonstrators chanted slogans demanding the building of the temple and waved a banner that said, ""No more requests, now it will be battle.""The Hindu hard-liners are building pressure on Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government to move quickly on the issue. Modi had promised to build the temple in the 2014 national elections that brought him to power. The next national elections are due before May next year.Security was stepped up for the rally, with thousands of police and paramilitary forces deployed in and around Ayodhya, a town 550 kilometers (350 miles) east of New Delhi, to prevent any attacks on Muslims, who comprise 6 percent of the town's more than 55,500 people.The gathering brought Hindu holy men and activists to the town where the Hindu god Ram was believed to have been born.""Hindus have waited for a long time.

301,"India’s religious divide continues to widen between Muslim, Hindu community","Syed Mohammad Munir Abidi says India is a changed country, one he doesn’t recognize anymore.It’s a country, the 68-year-old says, where Muslims are ignored, where rising attacks against them are encouraged, and where an emboldened Hindu majoritarian government is seizing its chance to put the minority community in its place.Swami Ram Das thinks otherwise, echoing a belief system central to Hindu nationalism.The 48-year-old Hindu priest says India is on a quest to redeem its religious past and that the country is fundamentally a Hindu nation where minorities, especially Muslims, must subscribe to Hindu primacy.Abidi and Das are two ordinary citizens living in one city in a country of more than 1.4 billion people that is on the cusp of becoming the world’s most populated nation. Together they embody the opposing sides of a deeply entrenched religious divide that presents India with one of its biggest challenges: to safeguard freedoms for its Muslim minority at a time when a rising tide of Hindu nationalism is eroding the country’s secular underpinnings.INDIAN COURT TO RULE ON CONGRESS PARTY LEADER RAHUL GANDHI'S APPEAL OF CRIMINAL DEFAMATION CONVICTION___Editor's Note: This story is part of an ongoing series exploring what it means for the 1.4 billion inhabitants of India to live in what will be the world’s most populated country.___India will have an estimated 1.4286 billion people against China’s 1.4257 billion by mid-2023, according to United Nations projections. It is home to some 200 million Muslims who make up the predominantly Hindu country’s largest minority group. They are scattered across almost every part of India, where a systemic anti-Muslim fury has descended since Prime Minister Narendra Modi first assumed power in 2014.Though India’s communal fractures date back to its bloody partition in 1947, most Indians trace the roots of the latest religious fault lines to a small temple city in northern India, where the Hindu nationalist movement was galvanized in 1992 after Hindu mobs demolished a historic mosque to make way for a temple.Since then, the city of Ayodhya has, in many ways, become a religious microcosm of India, where a diverse, multicultural past has gradually been overrun by ruptured relationships between Hindus and Muslims.It’s also a city Abidi and Das call home.They have meandered through its narrow, winding streets overrun by temple monkeys and Hindu monks who ask passersby for alms in exchange for blessings. They have walked past its brimming bazaars where miniature idols of Ram are sold to pilgrims visiting from India’s vast hinterlands. They have begun their mornings with calls for prayers spilling out of mosque loudspeakers and Vedic hymns chant in the temples.Beyond these shared experiences lie stark differences.On left, Hindu priest Swami Ram Das expresses his views sitting in his ashram on March 29, 2023. On right, Muslim community leader Syed Mohammad Munir Abidi speaks while sitting in a Mosque on March 28, 2023. Abidi and Das, who both live in Ayodya, India, embody the country’s religious divide. (AP Photo/Manish Swarup)For Das, a broad-shouldered man with a stout frame, Ayodhya is the birthplace of Ram, Hinduism’s most revered deity. The city also hosts one of Hinduism’s most sacred sites — Ram’s grand temple — which will open to pilgrims next year. It is imperative that the city clings to its Hindu character, Das says.""Our forefathers have fought for this temple and sacrificed lives for it. Today their dream is getting fulfilled,"" he says, circled by a group of devotees.The temple is being constructed where the 16th-century Babri mosque was demolished by Hindu hardliners who claim Muslim rulers built it at the exact spot where Ram was born. When it was razed on Dec. 6, 1992, Das was there, watching a frenzied Hindu mob climb its rounded domes and tear it down with pickaxes and crowbars.""There was so much excitement to destroy that disgraced structure that no one cared about the falling debris,"" he recounts, prompting his disciples to chant ""Jai Sri Ram,"" or ""Hail Lord Ram,"" a slogan that has become a battle cry for Hindu nationalists.The 30-year campaign to build the temple saw subsequent religious violence and a bitter legal battle over the site that Hindus won in 2019. Muslims were given alternate land on the city outskirts to build a new mosque. A year later, Modi attended the temple’s groundbreaking ceremony.For Abidi, a tall man in clothes that hang off his frame, it marked a sad chapter for India’s Muslims.""The hearts of Muslims are broken. No Muslim opposes the construction of Ram temple, but such unilateral changes are impacting India’s culture,"" he says, arguing the former mosque was essential to the city’s Muslim identity.As for his city, it has already gone through major changes.For decades Ayodhya city was part of Uttar Pradesh state’s Faizabad district. But in 2018, authorities changed the entire district’s name from Faizabad to Ayodhya, a move that reflected the Modi government’s pattern of replacing prominent Muslim geographic names with Hindu ones.IMAM STABBED DURING PRAYERS AT NEW JERSEY OMAR MOSQUE: REPORTSFor Abidi it indicates a worrying trend: ""To erase everything that remotely reflects Muslim culture.""Today, Ayodhya is taken over by frenetic construction of hotels, bringing in tens of thousands of Hindu pilgrims. Construction workers are busy making way for wider highways. All that is expected to boost the city’s economy. But at what cost, Abidi reckons.""The relationship Hindus and Muslims used to share is barely visible anymore,"" he says.India’s religious fault lines have become pronounced under Modi. Scores of Muslims have been lynched by Hindu mobs over allegations of eating beef or smuggling cow, an animal considered holy to Hindus. Muslim businesses have been boycotted, their localities have been bulldozed and places of worship set on fire. Sometimes open calls have been made for their genocide.Critics say Modi’s conspicuous silence over such attacks has emboldened some of his most extreme supporters and enabled more hate speech against Muslims.Muslims have been falsely accused of manipulating Hindu women into marriages and producing more children to establish domination. The government data shows otherwise: India’s religious composition has been largely stable since 1947 and the fertility rate of Muslims has declined from 4.4 in 1992 to 2.3 in 2020.""It is never going to be possible if you look at the data. We should forget and ignore this rhetoric,"" says Poonam Muttreja, director at the Population Foundation of India.Muslims also have the lowest literacy among all major Indian religious communities. They have faced discrimination in employment and housing and hold a little less than 5% of seats in the parliament, their lowest share ever.For Abidi, all this represents a grim future, one where India’s secular character lives only in people’s memories.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP""Every Muslim in today’s India finds himself unsafe,"" he says.Das disagrees, arguing that Muslims are still free to pray and practice their religion. ""But we will correct the mistakes made by your ancestors.""Das is referring to the Mughals who ruled India before the British made it their colony.Scorn for Mughal rulers, who are not ancestors of Indian Muslims and only shared a similar faith, is distinctive to India’s Hindu nationalists, who claim Mughals destroyed Hindu culture. It has prompted Hindu nationalists to seek ownership of hundreds of historic mosques they say are built over demolished temples.In Ayodhya, longtime Muslim locals have made compromises to avoid tension with Hindu neighbors.Last year when the Muharram procession overlapped with a Hindu festival, Muslim leaders changed the timing of their march to avoid confrontation. This year, Muslims in the city had to forgo selling and consumption of meat during another Hindu festival that coincided with the beginning days of Ramadan.In such an atmosphere, Abidi says, only religious tolerance can stop India’s communal fractures from worsening.""India will only survive if we mend hearts and not break them,"" he says.",Ayodhya Ram Mandir,https://www.foxnews.com/world/indias-religious-divide-continues-widen-muslim-hindu-community,FOX NEWS,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""framing"", ""reason"": ""The article frames the issue as a clash between Hindu nationalism and Muslim minority rights, with loaded language such as 'emboldened Hindu majoritarian government' and 'systemic anti-Muslim fury'.

India and Pakistan have exchanged fire every day since the attack along the Line of Control that separates the Indian and Pakistani areas of Kashmir.The Times of India reported on Tuesday that Modi has given the military the operational freedom to decide on the mode, targets, and timing of the response to the attack in Kashmir.PAKISTAN FEARS INDIA INCURSION 'IMMINENT' AMID HEIGHTENED TENSIONS FOLLOWING TERROR ATTACKKashmiri villager women walk past the blown-up family home of Asif Shiekh, a militant who officials all is involved in the deadly attack on tourists in Pahalgam, at Monghama village in Tral, south of Srinagar, Indian controlled Kashmir, Friday, April 25, 2025.  (AP Photo/Dar Yasin)Modi is set to convene another meeting of the Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) on Wednesday to coordinate India’s next moves.The move comes as Pakistan's Minister for information and broadcasting claimed on X that his country has ""credible intelligence that India intends carrying out military action against Pakistan in the next 24-36 hours on the pretext of baseless and concocted allegations of involvement in the Pahalgam incident.""Modi recently said India will ""identify, track and punish every terrorist, their handlers and their backers,"" in a post on X.

313,Here's why a flare-up between India and Pakistan over Kashmir matters,"India and Pakistan have intensified their hostilities over the hotly contested Kashmir region following a massacre of 26 mostly Indian tourists, which New Delhi linked to Pakistan.Pakistan denies it was behind Tuesday's attack by gunmen on a group of tourists in Kashmir. Both sides have since escalated the tensions by exchanging diplomatic and trade sanctions against each other and raising fears of a military conflict.INDIA VOWS TO HUNT TERRORISTS ‘TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH’ AS TENSIONS WITH PAKISTAN RISE AFTER KASHMIR ATTACKHere are five reasons why a flare-up between India and Pakistan matters:Under intense domestic pressure, India has hinted at the possibility of a limited military strike on Pakistan in response to what it called the ""terror attack"" with ""cross-border links."" Pakistan has made it clear that it will respond militarily to an attack.This raises fears that an escalation by any one side could lead to a wider war. The last time the two nations came to blows was in 2019, when a suicide car bombing killed 40 Indian soldiers in Kashmir.In 2021, the sides renewed a ceasefire agreement along their border, which has largely held. That relative calm was broken on Thursday after a brief exchange of fire between their armies.Both India and Pakistan are armed with nuclear weapons. There are fears that any conventional war or skirmish between them could potentially turn into a nuclear exchange.India and Pakistan fought two major wars, in 1965 and 1971, but in 1974, India conducted its first nuclear tests, raising the stakes in any military conflict. It triggered a nuclear race and Pakistan reached that same milestone in 1998.Kashmiri villager women walk past the blown-up family home of Asif Shiekh, a militant who officials say is involved in the deadly attack on tourists in Pahalgam, at Monghama village in Tral, south of Srinagar, Indian-controlled Kashmir, Friday.  (AP Photo/Dar Yasin)Since then, India and Pakistan have had one major border skirmish in 1999 that killed at least 1,000 combatants. The fighting only stopped after the U.S. intervened.India and China are geopolitical rivals whose armies clashed along the disputed Himalayan border in 2020. Ties between the Asian giants have improved since, but they still maintain large numbers of troops on their borders. Their borders are also contiguous to Pakistan's, making it the world’s only three-way nuclear junction.Beijing also controls a part of the Kashmir region that New Delhi says belongs to India.On the other hand, China is also a main ally of Pakistan and has helped advance its missile programs, creating additional military concerns for New Delhi. Meanwhile, India maintains strong defense ties with the U.S., which has long sought to limit Beijing’s rise in the Indo-Pacific region.Experts say any conflict between India and Pakistan is unlikely to stay strictly between them, as their strategic partners are likely to get involved.In response to the massacre, India suspended a crucial treaty that governs the flow of river waters into Pakistan. Pakistan said it would consider any attempt to stop the flow of water from India an ""act of war.""Under the Indus Water treaty, India is obliged to let six rivers flow freely to Pakistan. If India follows through and restricts the flow, it could have a devastating impact on Pakistan's agriculture as it battles acute water shortages.It's also a major environmental issue. Water insecurity is a big concern in both India and Pakistan due to rapidly growing populations and climate change.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPRights groups — including the U.N. — have blamed New Delhi for rights violations, including civilian killings and arbitrary arrests, in Indian-controlled Kashmir as a result of an intense crackdown by Indian forces.

""It could be an important part of President Trump’s legacy to attend to this situation — not with a Band-Aid solution, but by addressing the core issue: the Kashmir dispute.""Saeed described India’s response to the attack in Pahalgam — which left several Indian security forces dead — as dangerously premature and inflammatory.

(Reuters/Adnan Abidi)Pakistan claimed this week to have ""credible intelligence"" that an Indian counter-attack on its territory is imminent. The Indian Embassy in the U.S. did not respond to requests for comment on this story before publication time.The dust-up began with a tourist massacre on April 22 in Belgaum, Kashmir. All but one of the victims were Indian citizens, and India swiftly pointed the finger at Pakistan, which rejected the charge.The attack occurred in a remote valley only accessible on foot or by horse, and survivors claimed after the attack that the gunmen had accused some of the victims of supporting Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.The ambassador warned that the region, home to over 1.5 billion people, is once again being held ""hostage to the war of hysteria"" by India’s government and media, who immediately ""began beating war drums."" The pair of rivals have exchanged gunfire across their heavily militarized borders since the attack.He cited Pakistan’s request for evidence linking it to the attack and Islamabad’s offer to participate in a neutral, transparent inquiry — both of which he said have gone unanswered.""Any misadventure or miscalculation can lead to a nuclear interface,"" the ambassador said.

He questioned why India is looking outside its borders rather than addressing what he characterized as ""administrative inadequacies"" in Jammu and Kashmir, a territory he repeatedly referred to as ""illegally occupied.""He also criticized India’s broader policies in Kashmir, including the alleged settlement of non-residents into the region, and what he called threats to unilaterally block water flows from Pakistan’s rivers — a move he said violates the long-standing Indus Waters Treaty.""That is as grossly illegal as it can get,"" said Saeed. ""This is one treaty that has withstood wars between India and Pakistan."" Pakistan has said they would consider the cutting off of water supplies an act of war — and made pleas to The Hague, accusing New Delhi of water terrorism.The ambassador called on nations around the globe to help with a lasting settlement.""Previously, when the situation has been at this level or the tensions have escalated, the international community has attended to the situation, but taken their eyes, their attention away, even before the situation could fully diffuse,"" said Saeed. ""This time, perhaps it would be… timely in terms of the situation elsewhere on the globe, with similar instances, which one can note and see and are being attended to to perhaps not afford a Band-Aid solution, but to address the broader problem.""PAKISTAN FEARS INDIA INCURSION 'IMMINENT' AMID HEIGHTENED TENSIONS FOLLOWING TERROR ATTACKActivists and supporters of the All Parties Hurriyat Conference take part in an anti-India protest in Muzaffarabad on Friday following Pakistan and India's ongoing border tensions over the Kashmir tourist attack.
