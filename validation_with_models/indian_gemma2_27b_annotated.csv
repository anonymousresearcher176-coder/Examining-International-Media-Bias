577,"NCERT brings Operation Sindoor to classrooms, calls it a promise of peace","NEW DELHI: The National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) has rolled out two special supplementary modules on Operation Sindoor for Classes III to XII, presenting the mission as not just a military response but also a pledge to safeguard peace and honour the victims of the Pahalgam terror attack . The material has been introduced a little over three months after the counter-offensive. The modules underline that despite Pakistan’s official denial, the Pahalgam attack was carried out on the “direct orders” of Pakistan’s military and political leadership. Detailing India’s retaliatory action, the material notes: “India launched missiles and air strikes, targeting nine terrorist sites situated in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir (PoJK) on May 7, 2025. Out of nine targets which were finally chosen and approved, seven of these terror camps were destroyed by the Indian Army, while the Indian Air Force destroyed terrorist targets in Muridke and Bahawalpur, which are the nerve centres of Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed. ” The council has reiterated the government’s position that civilians were not harmed. “Every target was double-checked. Only terrorist bases were attacked. This operation showed that India would not let terror masterminds escape punishment,” one module states. The two modules are titled Operation Sindoor: A Saga of Valour for Classes III–VIII and Operation Sindoor: A Mission of Honour and Bravery for Classes IX–XII. They aim to raise awareness among students about India’s military capability and resilience. The material describes Operation Sindoor as “a triumph of bravery, strategy and innovation,” highlighting India’s use of advanced air defence systems like the S-400, which shot down enemy aircraft and neutralised drones. The modules also place emphasis on the wave of public solidarity after the Pahalgam attack. They describe nationwide candlelight marches and note that “Muslim communities in Hyderabad, Lucknow, and Bhopal wore black armbands and openly denounced the attack. In Kashmir, shopkeepers closed their shops in protest, and border villages demanded strong action in support of the Armed Forces.” The secondary module stresses that local Kashmiri populations “stood up and spoke against terrorists, breaking stereotypes and reflecting the real voice of peace-loving people. ” Explaining the choice of the name, the modules state that “Operation Sindoor” was selected as a tribute to the widows of victims, symbolising solidarity, empathy and respect. The content situates Operation Sindoor within the continuum of India’s firm responses to terror, drawing parallels with the Balakot air strikes of 2019 after Pulwama and earlier wars in 1947, 1965, 1971 and 1999. It underscores that groups like Jaish-e-Mohammed, Lashkar-e-Taiba, Hizbul Mujahideen and Pakistan’s ISI were behind the attacks. “It was not just a military operation; it was a promise to protect peace and honour the lives lost,” the modules conclude.",Operation Sindoor,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ncert-brings-operation-sindoor-to-classrooms-calls-it-a-promise-of-peace/articleshow/123391803.cms,TOI,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""framing"", ""reason"": ""The article frames Operation Sindoor as a heroic and necessary response to terrorism, emphasizing bravery, peace-keeping, and public support."", ""confidence"": 0.9}"
580,"KBC 17: Colonel Sofiya Qureshi shares inspiring stories and insights from Operation Sindoor; says, “A weapon or a fighter aircraft doesn’t distinguish between males and females”","Colonel Sofiya Qureshi, Wing Commander Vyomika Singh, and Commander Prerna Deosthalee shared insights into Operation Sindoor , India’s mission launched after the April 22 Pahalgam attack, during a special episode of Kaun Banega Crorepati on Friday. Wing Commander Singh described the precision strikes that crippled terrorist infrastructure, saying, “We attacked in the interiors of the enemy to break their backs. Twenty-one terror camps were recognised. Nine camps were finalised, and the game was done in 25 minutes.” Operation Sindoor, launched on May 7, targeted nine terrorist infrastructure sites across Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, eliminating several terrorists. Colonel Qureshi explained the choice of targets: “Bahawalpur was the headquarters of the Jaish-e-Mohammed , from where terrorists who attacked Pathankot and Pahalgam were trained. Muridke had the headquarters of the Lashkar-e-Taiba , where Ajmal Kasab and David Headley were trained. Therefore, we had to destroy those places.” She added that Pakistan had sent 300–400 drones, both armed and unarmed: “They sent unarmed drones to scan India’s weapon and defence capability around the Line of Control and the international border. But the army air defence successfully disabled their attempts.” C ommander Deosthalee outlined the navy’s role in the operation: “The navy was battle-ready. We managed the trade routes to stabilise the economy and also ensured deterrence, as a dual job. We also protected the maritime borders, as there were anti-national elements that entered in the past. Being part of this mission is a matter of pride and honour.” Describing naval warfare as “360 degrees of uncertainty with no room for error in the middle of the endless sea without borders,” she added: “When we strike, we strike in a manner that the enemy would remember forever.” The officers also credited local residents for their role in rescue efforts following the Pahalgam attack. Highlighting women’s contributions, Colonel Qureshi noted that over 100 women had been trained on par with men: “This enabled them to handle the operations seamlessly.” Wing Commander Singh added: “A weapon or a fighter aircraft doesn’t distinguish between males and females.” Colonel Qureshi emphasised the armed forces’ readiness and said: “You have to trust the Indian armed forces; whenever there will be any attack on the country, we have given a stern message to Pakistan and we will keep on doing it in the future.” She further said that Operation Sindoor reflected a whole-of-nation approach involving both the government and the armed forces: “We are a peace-loving nation and want to live in synergy with our neighbours. Our next-gen tech weapons are so advanced now that we made the operation possible without any civilian fatalities.”",Operation Sindoor,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/tv/news/hindi/kbc-17-colonel-sofiya-qureshi-shares-inspiring-stories-and-insights-from-operation-sindoor-says-a-weapon-or-a-fighter-aircraft-doesnt-distinguish-between-males-and-females/articleshow/123330121.cms,TOI,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""tonality"", ""reason"": ""The article uses strong positive language to describe the operation and the Indian armed forces ('crippled terrorist infrastructure', 'eliminating several terrorists', 'stern message', 'advanced tech weapons')."", ""confidence"": 0.8}"

His remarks reinforced the nation's position that no external party, including the US, played a role in the pause in military action between India and Pakistan after Operation Sindoor was launched following the April 22 terrorist attack in Pahalgam on that killed 26 men. Earlier, IAF chief Air Chief Marshal AP Singh had detailed how the 88-90-hour campaign crippled Pakistan's systems and pushed it to seek talks through DGMO. ""The success of Operation Sindoor - the strength of Indian forces to destroy terrorist hideouts deep across the border, and the ability to bring Pakistan, which came to the rescue of terrorists, to its knees in hours - showed the world the new face of India,"" Modi said on his first Bengaluru visit since the operation. He credited ""technology and the strength of Make-in-India in defence"" for the success, saying Bengaluru and Karnataka's youth played a ""significant role"". TOI had earlier reported that Bengaluru-built systems - SkyStriker suicide drones from the private sector, Akash missiles from BEL, and other BEL, HAL and private-sector products - were deployed.

692,PM dedicates Op Sindoorsuccess to Lord Mahadev,"Varanasi: Invoking Lord Shiv's ‘Rudra roop' (fierce form) to describe India's resolute action against terrorism, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday dedicated the success of Operation Sindoor to Lord Vishwanath and said it showcased the country's strength to the world and delivered a clear message that anyone who dares attack India will not be spared, not even in ‘Pataal Lok'. Opening his address with chants of ""Om Namah Parvati Pataye, Har Har Mahadev"", the PM recalled the pain of the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack . ""My heart was filled with sorrow for the 26 people who lost their lives in the Pahalgam terror attack,"" Modi said during his 51st visit to his Lok Sabha constituency. ""My promise to avenge ‘Sindoor' of our daughters was fulfilled with the blessings of Mahadev... I dedicate the success of the operation to the feet of Mahadev,"" the PM said. Addressing a public meeting in the Kalikadham area, Modi said, ""The valour of Indian defence forces and blessings of Lord Vishwanath, who signifies ‘welfare', but embodies the fierce form of Rudra and Kaal Bhairav when confronted with terror and injustice, made it possible to fulfil his promise to avenge the Sindoor of the daughters."" The PM said the success of Operation Sindoor could not be digested by Congress and its ‘chela-chapatas' (followers and alliance partners), and they are troubled that India destroyed terrorist bases in Pakistan. ""When the visuals showed how Indian drones precisely targeted and reduced terrorist headquarters to ruins, apart from destroying Pakistani air bases, like Pakistan — the mastermind of terrorism — the Congress and SP also started mourning. "" Questioning whether Sindoor — the symbol of dignity and sacrifice — could ever be considered a spectacle, Modi said these opposition parties insulted the valour of the defence forces by terming Operation Sindoor a ‘tamasha'. He asked whether the bravery of the armed forces and the fulfilment of a vow to avenge the sindoor of sisters could be trivialised in such a manner. Without taking any name, the PM said that for his vote-bank and appeasement politics, the leader of SP, who kept giving clean chits to terrorists and withdrew cases against those involved in bomb blasts during his regime in UP, questioned the timing of the elimination of the accused of the Pahalgam massacre in Parliament. Modi asked, ""Whether the opposition leader wanted that he should be given a call before initiating this action or wait to enable terrorists to escape. "" These parties are troubled by the elimination of terrorists and the name of Operation Sindoor, he said, adding that, ""This is a new India — one that worships Lord Shiv and also knows how to embody the form of Kaal Bhairav against the country's enemies."" Made-in-UP missiles to destroy Pak if it indulges in any misadventure: PM Mentioning how the world witnessed the power of India's indigenous weaponry and the effectiveness of India's air defence systems, missiles, and drones during Operation Sindoor, PM Modi said that the impact of BrahMos missiles not only instilled fear in the enemy but also demonstrated the progress being made under ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat'. Modi said, ""Soon, production of BrahMos missiles will begin in Lucknow... Major companies setting up their plants in the defence corridor of UP and starting to manufacture weapons will further strengthen our forces.

700,Operation Sindoor: India offers terror fight aid to Pakistan; Rajnath Singh says help available if they can’t act,"File photo: Defense minister Rajnath Singh (Picture credit: IANS) NEW DELHI: Defence minister Rajnath Singh on Tuesday said India is ready to assist Pakistan in combating terrorism, asserting that Indian forces are capable of tackling terror threats across the border as well. Speaking in the Rajya Sabha during a special discussion on Operation Sindoor , Singh said, “If you [Pakistan] are not able to take action against terrorism, take help from India, we are ready to help.” “Our forces are capable of fighting terror on this side of the border, as well as on the other side,” he added, noting that this had been proven through Operation Sindoor, India’s military response following the Pahalgam attack in April. Singh said the operation has now been suspended, but warned it could resume if Pakistan continued to support terrorism. “If Pakistan commits any terror incidents in future, we will relaunch Operation Sindoor without hesitation… There can be a comma but no full stop,” he said. The defence minister informed the House that three terrorists involved in the Pahalgam attack, which left 26 people dead, had been killed by Indian forces. He lauded the military’s efforts, stating, “I congratulate the forces for killing three terrorists who carried out the Pahalgam terror attack.” Singh said the operation was initiated after Prime Minister Narendra Modi held a meeting with the service chiefs and gave them full freedom to decide on a suitable response. “The aim was to destroy terror infrastructure and give the message of zero tolerance for terror,” Singh said, adding that India's action was in self-defence and not expansionist. He further said Pakistan’s director general of military operations had requested India to halt hostilities, and India agreed on the condition that the operation would be ""suspended, not terminated"". Singh further emphasised that the military leadership had thoroughly planned the operation to avoid harm to civilians. “We chose the option that would cause maximum damage to terrorists and their bases while ensuring no harm to Pakistan’s ordinary citizens,” he said. Singh also criticised the United Nations for allowing Pakistan’s inclusion in a key counter-terrorism committee and appealed to the global community to stop funding Islamabad, claiming a large portion goes towards supporting terror. The session in the Upper House saw opposition members including TMC MPs raising slogans and walking out after their points were not allowed. Singh, meanwhile, asserted that “a day will come” when people in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir will proudly identify as Indians.

Morever, for most, the ‘loss is irreplaceable.'

Sabari Guha, whose husband, Samir Guha—a former central govt statistics officer—was killed by the terrorists at Baisaran Valley barely 15 minutes after arriving there, said she was indebted to the Indian Armed Forces, the J&K Police, and the CRPF.

What happened in Pahalgam was very unfortunate; innocent people were brutally killed. I take full responsibility for the incident, which was undoubtedly a security failure. The common belief here has been that terrorists do not target tourists. The location where the attack took place is an open meadow. There is no facility or room for security forces to be present there. Operation Sindoor Against Pakistan Was India's Warning to China Too: US Warfare Expert John Spencer This was a Pakistan-sponsored terror attack. The arrests made by NIA in the case corroborate local involvement but it would still be wrong to conclude that the security environment in J&K stands completely vitiated. The attack was a debilitating and deliberate strike on the nation’s soul. The intention of the neighbour (Pakistan) was to create a communal divide and trigger a backlash against the people of J&K living in other parts of the country, adding to the feeling of alienation. Pakistan doesn’t want J&K to be peaceful and prosperous. In the past five years, the J&K economy’s size has doubled. Tourists have been flocking in high numbers. This (attack) was a hit by Pakistan at the economic well-being of Kashmir. But condemnation and protests by the people of Kashmir following the attack provided a befitting reply to Pakistan and terror outfits. They were clear signs that terrorism is not acceptable here anymore. There has been no attack in J&K since Operation Sindoor. Do you think this will hold? Operation Sindoor has drawn red lines for Pakistan. India has made it clear that any terror attack will be considered an act of war. The manner in which our forces carried out precise hits against terror facilities in Pakistan, and when it tried to target our military and civilian assets, how they destroyed their airbases, conveyed a stern message to Pakistan. Still, a country that has made terrorism its declared state policy, is not to be trusted. I am confident that the home ministry, defence ministry and our intelligence agencies are keeping a watch on Pakistan. But it is a fact that there has been no terror attack in J&K after Operation Sindoor. Is local involvement in Pahalgam attack a worry for security agencies? Local terror recruitment is at an all-time low. There has been just one incident of local recruitment this year as compared to 6 to 7 last year; there was a time when this figure used to be 150-200. But it is also a fact that Pakistan has facilitated the infiltration of a large number of terrorists in both Jammu region and Kashmir region. How has the Pahalgam incident impacted tourism in J&K? Tourist arrivals had almost stopped after the Pahalgam incident. We believed that the Amarnath yatra would be turning point. What is the status on tourist destinations closed after Pahalgam attack? We have already opened many. Others will be opened too in a phased manner.

884,Chandrayaan-3 Propulsion Module moved from Lunar orbit to Earth's orbit,"Representative image NEW DELHI: In another unique experiment, like the hop experiment on the Vikram Lander, the Propulsion Module (PM) of Chandrayaan-3 was moved from an orbit around the Moon to an orbit around Earth , said the Indian Space Research Organization ( ISRO ). ""Chandrayaan-3 Mission: Ch-3's Propulsion Module (PM) takes a successful detour! In another unique experiment, the PM is brought from Lunar orbit to Earth's orbit. An orbit-raising manoeuvre and a Trans-Earth injection manoeuvre placed PM in an Earth-bound orbit,"" ISRO posted on X. The primary objective of Chandrayaan-3 mission was to demonstrate soft landing near to lunar south polar region and perform experiments using the instruments on Vikram and Pragyaan.The spacecraft was launched on July 14, 2023 on-board LVM3-M4 vehicle from SDSC, SHAR. On August 23, Vikram Lander made its historic touch down on Moon and subsequently Pragyan rover was deployed. The scientific instruments in Lander and Rover were operated continuously for 1 lunar day as per the defined mission life. The mission objectives of Chandrayaan-3 have been completely met. With regard to the Propulsion Module, the main objective was to ferry the Lander module from Geostationary transfer orbit (GTO) to the final lunar polar circular orbit and separate the Lander. After separation, the Spectro-polarimetry of the Habitable Planet Earth (SHAPE) payload in the PM was also operated. The initial plan was to operate this payload for about three months during the mission life of PM. The precise orbit injection by LVM3 and optimal earth / lunar burn manoeuvres resulted in the availability of over 100 kg of fuel in the PM after over one month of operations in the lunar orbit. It was decided to use the available fuel in the PM to derive additional information for future lunar missions and demonstrate the mission operation strategies for a sample return mission. In order to continue the SHAPE payload for Earth observation, it was decided to re-orbit the PM to a suitable Earth orbit.This mission plan was worked out considering the collision avoidance such as preventing the PM from crashing onto the Moon's surface or entering into the Earth's GEO belt at 36000 km and orbits below that. Considering the estimated fuel availability and the safety of GEO spacecraft, the optimal Earth return trajectory was designed for October 2023 month. First maneuver was performed on October 9, 2023 to raise apolune altitude to 5112 km from 150 km thus, increasing the period of orbit from 2.1 hrs to 7.2 hrs. Later, considering the estimate of available propellant, the second maneuver plan was revised to target an Earth orbit of 1.8 lakhs x 3.8 lakhs km. The Trans-Earth injection (TEI)maneuver was performed on October 13, 2023. In the post-TEI maneuver realized orbit, the propulsion module made four Moon fly-bys before departing Moon SOI on November 10. Currently, propulsion module is orbiting Earth and crossed its first perigee on November 22nd with an altitude of 1.54 lakhs km. The orbit period is nearly 13 days with 27-degree inclination. The perigee and apogee altitude vary during its trajectory and the predicted minimum perigee altitude is 1.15 lakhs km. Hence as per current orbit prediction, there is no threat of close approach with any operational Earth orbiting satellites. As per the plan, SHAPE payload is being operated whenever Earth is in its field of view. Also, a special operation of the SHAPE payload was carried out on October 28, 2023 during a Solar Eclipse. The Shape payload operations will continue further. UR Rao Satellite Centre/ISRO's flight dynamics team has developed an analysis tool from first principles for this operation which is being validated through the return maneuvers carried out for the Chandrayaan-3 PM. The main outcome from the return maneuvers carried out on CH3 PM related to future missions--planning and execution of trajectory and maneuvers to return from Moon to Earth, development of a software module to plan such a maneuver and its preliminary validation, planning and execution of a gravity-assisted flyby across a planets/ celestial body, and avoiding uncontrolled crashing of the PM on the Moon's surface at the end of life of PM thus meeting the requirements of no debris creation.",Chandrayaan-3,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/chandrayaan-3-propulsion-module-moved-from-lunar-orbit-to-earths-orbit/articleshow/105744189.cms,TOI,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""tonality"", ""reason"": ""The article uses celebratory and positive language (e.g., 'successful detour', 'historic touch down') when describing the mission's achievements."", ""confidence"": 0.8}"

ISRO 's ambitious third Moon mission Chandrayaan-3's Lander Module (LM) comprising the lander (Vikram) and the rover ( Pragyan ) is all set to land on the lunar surface on Wednesday evening at 6.04 pm, as India eyes becoming the first country to reach the uncharted south pole of Earth's only natural satellite. ""I am very excited about what Chandrayaan-3 can achieve for us,"" New York-based commodity trader and Physics enthusiast Sandeep Daga told PTI. The Chandrayaan-3 mission ""is really a shot in the arm for the Indian space programme and the ISRO (Indian Space Research Organisation). It will propel India as a global leader in space technology and it will inspire millions of kids to take up science, physics and astronomy as their area of pursuit. That's the way to go,"" Daga said. Daga, like many other members of the Indian diaspora here, are keenly following Chandrayaan-3's countdown to land on the lunar surface later today, propelling India to the elite space club of nations that have landed a rover on the moon. Till now only three other nations - the US, China and the erstwhile Soviet Union - have landed a rover on the moon. ""I am very excited about Chandrayaan-3. We will be only the fourth country in the world to land a rover on the moon,"" Daga said. Describing the lunar mission as a ""moment of pride for India"", Daga underlined the project's massive economic impact. ""We know that the space economy is worth more than half a trillion dollars every quarter. So it is a pretty big deal. I see (Chandrayaan-3) as a vindication of India's technological prowess. And what's even more amazing is that we have achieved this mission at a cost of less than USD 75 million, which is much lower than what a Hollywood space movie would cost today,"" he said. ""With this, we are firmly in the race to make a permanent establishment on the moon."" Daga further noted that India will be the first country to land a rover on the lunar south pole. ""All prior missions have landed on the equator of the moon where the surface is quite flat and smooth. Trying to land it on one of the poles is extremely difficult because they have a large number of craters and mountains and it becomes technically quite challenging to land safely,"" he said. Daga added that Chandrayaan-3 can give immense data about water at the southern pole of the moon, which he said can be a very important input into having some permanent establishment on the surface of the moon.

Discussing the conceptual framework of the latest Chandrayaan mission, Sivan emphasized the pivotal moment of the lander's gentle touch down, a moment awaited by all. Reflecting on the path covered by Chandrayaan 2, Sivan noted the journey through multiple phases that Chandrayaan 3 had accomplished. Yet, it was during the landing that an unforeseen issue rose, leading to a failed attempt. Sivan , however, expressed confidence in Chandrayaan 3's prospects. In an interview with PTI, Sivan conveyed that this time around, there was much anticipation for a successful landing. The agency had diligently corrected the shortcomings encountered during Chandrayaan 2, focusing on areas where margins were minimum. The collective sentiment is of optimism, anticipating the forthcoming mission to culminate in triumph. Currently, Chandrayaan 3 has completed its meticulously designed movements and is en route to the lunar surface. However, a pivotal step now remains before the final descent: the separation of the lander and propulsion modules. ""As the next manoeuvre unfolds, its significance cannot be understated, given the inherently critical nature of any activity in space.

The photographs taken at at 7.3am and 11am Wednesday using the onboard cameras of Pragyan , the rover, also show two payloads — Instrument for Lunar Seismic Activity (ILSA) and Chandra’s Surface Thermo Physical Experiment (ChaSTE) — descending on to the lunar surface for in-situ experiments. The second batch (taken at 11am) of photos Isro released was taken from just 15m from the lander. The Pragyan navigation cameras, the ones that guide the rover, were developed in a quiet lab called LEOS in Bengaluru. Chandrayaan-3's Rover Pragyan crosses massive 4-metre crater positioned just 3m ahead of it The Laboratory for Electro-Optics Systems or LEOS had first developed these cameras as early as 2012 as part of preparations for Chandrayaan-2. The cameras were onboard the rover that went as part of the 2019 mission that failed. “In 2019, a rover task group was formed with 12 people again. And the target set for me was to make light-weight cameras that could withstand lunar radiation and extreme temperatures. Each of the two cameras weigh only 125 grams. We’ve used LEOS’ own optics and miniaturised sensor and its great to see it work so well. The lander photo released today looks very clear,” Selvaraj P, former Isro group head, LEOS, and project manager of rover, told TOI. ‘India took a walk on the moon’: Chandrayaan-3’s rover Pragyan begins exploring moon’s surface These miniaturised digital cameras, Selvaraj said, use multi-element lenses and their image quality was verified through a host of tests on the ground. “These cameras can withstand 50 megarad (radiation in space) which means unlike regular cameras that can get damaged in such conditions, these can perform for a really long time. The material and processes used also allow it to survive extremely low temperatures. We’ve tested it for -200° Celsius in vacuum. We expect it to survive the night and return to life when the sun rises again,” Selvaraj said. These cameras are the eyes of Pragyan, allowing it to navigate on the lunar surface, while also sending in pictures. For every path planning, data from these navigation cameras need to be downloaded to ground where a digital elevation model (DEM) is generated. Then, the ground and mechanisms teams decide which path is best for Pragyan and uplink the command for the rover to follow. The images taken by the rover further reiterate how smooth the landing was on August 23 and how firm Vikram is on Moon.

""We are able to bring it down very correctly this time. The orbit changes are happening as planned. There is no deviation. So, it shows excellent results and we are hoping that all will be fine,"" the ISRO chairman said. He said the experience from Chandrayaan-2, the 2019 mission that was a partial success, was proving to be very useful as the space agency attempted to land a spacecraft on moon. ""The Chandrayaan-2 experience will be of great help. We went through in great detail on what possibly went wrong. We re-constructed the scenario and made a lot of modifications to Chandrayaan-3,"" Somanath said. He said images of the moon from Chandrayaan-2 mission were used in Chandrayaan-3 for its better positioning and increasing the landing area measurements. ""We have gathered more intelligence to handle contingencies and failure. We went through an extensive testing programme to validate all of this,"" Somanath said. On Sunday, Isro released the first images of the moon captured by Chandrayaan-3. The stunning images were taken after the spacecraft entered the Moon's orbit on Saturday.

991,"Chandrayaan-3 targeted this year; corrections in progress, hardware realisation almost done","BENGALURU: The Indian Space Research Organisation ( Isro ), which has a packed year ahead of it, has made considerable progress on its third moon mission — Chandrayaan-3. With many related hardware and their special tests having been successfully completed, the team is moving closer to integrated testing. Isro chairman S Somanath told TOI: “Chandrayaan-3 has been going through a series of reviews, improvements, and strengthening. Some of these are based on the issues we’ve seen earlier. But the issues we’ve learnt so far may not be the only ones. The questions are many and we need to foresee a lot of them, which may further require corrections. The hardware is under realisation too.” While Somanath is expected to conduct a formal review of the project later this month, minister of state, department of space, Jitendra Singh, has said that based on the learnings from Chandrayaan-2 and suggestions made by the national-level experts, the realisation of Chandrayaan-3 is in progress. “The launch is scheduled for August 2022,” he added. According to more than one scientist associated with the project, testing and fabrication of the lander and other systems that will be part of Chandrayaan-3 is ongoing at various Isro centres while design changes have been nearly finalised. Isro conceived Chandrayaan-3 after it failed to soft-land Vikram (lander) on the lunar surface while it still has a fully operational orbiter of Chandrayaan-2 going around Moon. While the mission was initially planned for late 2020 or 2021, the department of space (DoS), owing to Covid-19, had said earlier this year that the launch is being targeted for 2022. “...Because we need a specific launch window, we need to work towards a deadline, failing which it will have to move to next year. But the top management is very clear that all steps in the process will be complete before we actually launch the mission,” a source said. In his New Year message on January 3, then Isro chairman K Sivan had said: “Chandrayaan-3 design changes incorporating and testing has seen huge progress. The mission could be launched by the middle of the year.” As reported first by TOI, Chandrayaan-3 will see major design changes compared to the previous mission, key among which is the decision to drop the fifth engine, which was added last minute on Vikram (Chandrayaan-2’s lander). The lander for this mission will have only four engines, while the overseeing committee has also suggested a minor modification on the legs on the lander, inclusion of the laser doppler velocimeter (LDV) for better measurement of speed during landing, among other things. The modifications being proposed on Chandrayaan-3 — which were indicators of shortcomings in Chandrayaan-2 — also include changes in software and algorithms, strengthening of the legs and better power and communication systems. That the Union Budget 2022-23 among other things has listed one mission of GSLV-Mk3 is also seen as reasons for optimism so far as Chandrayaan-3 is concerned.",Chandrayaan-3,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/chandrayaan-3-targeted-this-year-corrections-in-progress-hardware-realisation-almost-done/articleshow/89322779.cms,TOI,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""tonality"", ""reason"": ""The article uses positive and optimistic language regarding the progress of Chandrayaan-3, such as 'considerable progress', 'moving closer', 'corrections', and 'optimism'."", ""confidence"": 0.8}"

After the successful landing of Chandrayaan-3, festive celebrtaions started at Vinti Bhatia’s house. Vinti Bhatia, daughter of Krishna Gopal Bhatia, a resident of Block 13, Govind Nagar, was pursuing PhD from IIT Kanpur, when she was selected for ISRO in 2016. Vinti then worked closely with the team to land Chandrayaan-3. She did thermal designing of the lander with her team. When Chandrayaan-3 successfully landed on Moon, Vinti gave this good news to her parents over the phone in Kanpur. Her mother Chandra Mohini Bhatia is a retired principal of Cantt Board School. Her parents said that they feel proud on their daughter’s achievement. “We can not describe our happiness in words. She not only made us proud but also made the entire nation proud,” they said, adding, “Vinti has done her intermediate studies from Guru Nanak Public School, Nazirabad. She completed her BTech from Ghaziabad. After doing MS from IIT Delhi, she was doing PhD from IIT Kanpur when she joined ISRO in 2016.” “She knows how to do the toughest tasks and is very brave,” added her mother. Her father Krishna Gopal Bhatia said that he used to drop his daughter to school which was 7 km away from their home. “Today I feel that my hard work has paid off. Today I realized what heights my daughter has achieved,” he said.

1219,Covaxin: No consent means no inoculation,"Beneficiaries cannot choose which vaccine they get, but those receiving Covaxin must submit consent BENGALURU: Covaxin , the first indigenous Covid-19 vaccine, will be administered at six of the 243 Covid-19 vaccination centres across the state when the nationwide drive to inoculate healthcare workers is launched on Saturday. The government has insisted beneficiaries receiving Covaxin must submit consent. This is mandatory. However, beneficiaries will not have the right to choose between the two vaccines, officials said. This means a health worker who doesn’t provide consent for Covaxin will miss out on being vaccinated. Covaxin will be administered at one centre each in Ballari, Chamarajanagar, Davanagere, Hassan, Chikkamagaluru and Shivamogga districts. Of the total 24,300 healthcare workers to be vaccinated on Saturday, 600 will be administered Covaxin. “In future, all centres will administer both Covaxin and Covishield,” said Pankaj Kumar Pandey, commissioner, health and family welfare department. “If a beneficiary refuses to take Covaxin, as of now, there is no option to offer another vaccine.” Asked on what basis the six centres were chosen, Pandey said the state has received only 20,000 doses of Covaxin and allocation was based on the number of healthcare workers. Not giving beneficiaries the right to choose is unacceptable, especially since Phase 3 clinical trials for Covaxin have not been completed, said Dr Madhusudhan Kariganuru, former president, IMAKarnataka. “Beneficiaries who refuse Covaxin must not be differentiated by the government if she later contracts Covid-19,” said Dr Kariganuru. “A healthcare worker who chooses not to be vaccinated must continue to be eligible for free Covid-19 treatment in government hospitals.” K Sudhakar, health minister, said, “As per government of India guidelines, all vaccines are safe. But vaccination is not compulsory.” Resentment though is brewing over the lack of choice. The six centres where Covaxin will be administered are either state-run medical colleges or district hospitals. In Chamarajanagar for instance, the district hospital has been allotted Covishield, while Chamarajanagar medical college has been allotted Covaxin. “The college has raised concerns saying the efficacy of Covaxin is yet to be proven. But we have to go by government guidelines,” said Dr MR Ravi, Chamarajanagar DHO. Dr GN Sanjeev, dean, Chamarajnagar medical college, said some professors voiced concerns and spoke to the DHO. “Some of them were apprehensive,” he said. In Ballari, Vijaynagar Medical College has been allocated Covaxin. Medicos said they were unaware that they will be administered Covaxin. “We attended a workshop on Friday, but we weren’t told the vaccine’s name,” they said.",Covaxin,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/covaxin-no-consent-means-no-inoculation/articleshow/80296735.cms,TOI,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""tonality"", ""reason"": ""The article uses phrases like 'resentment brewing' and quotes concerns about Covaxin's efficacy, creating a negative tone towards the vaccine."", ""confidence"": 0.8}"
1229,Covid-19: Bharat Biotech seeks Covaxin EUA for 2-18 year olds in Mexico,"Covaxin has already received EUA for adults in Mexico HYDERABAD: Vaccine maker Bharat Biotech on Monday said it has sought emergency use authorisation (EUA) from Mexican health regulator, COFEPRIS (Comision Federal para la Proteccion contra Riesgos Sanitarios), for its Covid-19 vaccine Covaxin for children in the 2-18 years age bracket through its US and Canada partner Ocugen Inc. Covaxin has already received EUA for adults in Mexico . The city-based vaccine maker said it has expanded its US market co-development, supply and commercialisation agreement for Covaxin with Ocugen Inc to include Mexico too, giving Ocugen the Covaxin commercialisation rights for entire North America. Bharat Biotech said the license extension for commercialisation in Mexico includes the same profit share structure as in United States. ""We're excited to commercialise Covaxin in Mexico as authorities there have made conquering this pandemic a major priority. After meeting with Mexico's secretary of foreign affairs, Marcelo Ebrard, in Delhi, we are encouraged by the role Covaxin can play in Mexico's continuing efforts to defeat the Covid-19 pandemic. Covaxin is currently under review by COFEPRIS for emergency use among children between 2 and 18 years of age,"" said Ocugen chairman, CEO and co-founder Dr Shankar Musunuri. Bharat Biotech CMD Dr Krishna Ella said they would expedite technology transfer activities towards commercial scale manufacturing of Covaxin in North America. The development comes even as the World Health Organisation (WHO), earlier this month, suspended Covaxin supply for procurement by UN agencies citing good manufacturing practices deficiencies at Bharat Biotech's Telangana facilities and advised countries, who have received the vaccine, to take appropriate actions.

1249,"Four minutes for a Covishield jab; consent form, checkup double Covaxin time","Recipients have to wait for 30 minutes after the vaccination for observation MUMBAI: If it takes around four minutes to check the documents and administer the Covishield vaccine, it takes double the time for the Covaxin vaccine. The time associated with Covaxin vaccine is longer because the recipient, unlike the takers of the Covishield vaccine, has to sign a consent form as per the requirement of its Drug Controller General of India (DGCI) clearance. “Also, readings of the recipient’s blood pressure, temperature and oxygen saturation have to be taken,” said Dr Ranjit Mankeshwar, acting dean of state-run JJ Hospital, Byculla. JJ Hospital is one of the six centres where the Covaxin is available. The recipient of the Covaxin vaccine is also asked a series of questions, such as contact with people who travelled. “Also, a three-page document is given to the recipient in which he or she has to insert a tick mark if they develop any symptoms over the next seven days,” said a doctor; the document has to be later handed over to the vaccinators. Recipients for the Serum Institute of India’s Covishield vaccine, on the other hand, are not asked any questions. Only their identity proof is verified. Many doctors, however, advise people to consult their family physician for a thorough evaluation of any possible allergic reaction. All vaccine recipients have to wait for 30 minutes after the vaccination for observation. Dr S Nikam, the civil surgeon at Amravati district hospital, said that it takes a minimum of 40 minutes—including 10 minutes for the pre-vaccine work and the vaccine—for each recipient getting the Covaxin. Covishield and Covaxin are different types of vaccines. While Covaxin is made from an inactivated or dead virus, Covishield uses a replication-deficient chimpanzee viral vector that is a weakened version of a common cold virus (adenovirus). “Covaxin is safe because it is based on an inactivated virus and has very low to zero side-effects,” said state department of medical education’s chief Dr T P Lahane, who, as a kidney transplant patient, has been advised to take Covaxin.",Covaxin,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/4-mins-for-a-covishield-jab-consent-form-checkup-double-covaxin-time/articleshow/80337086.cms,TOI,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""tonality"", ""reason"": ""The article subtly frames Covaxin as more complex and burdensome due to the extra steps involved, potentially implying it's less desirable."", ""confidence"": 0.7}"

HYDERABAD: A day after a study conducted by AIIMS on healthcare professionals, showing Covaxin has a 50% efficacy against symptomatic Covid-19, were published in the Lancet Infectious Diseases journal, Bharat Biotech said the results provide evidence for effectiveness of Covaxin in real life settings. “An effectiveness result of 50% achieved during the peak Covid-19 delta variant wave in India, in a high risk study population of physicians and health care workers, in a hospital environment, and who are challenged repeatedly with high viral loads, provides insights into the efficacy and effectiveness of Covaxin,” the vaccine developer said in a tweet on Thursday. The company said these results compare well with the 65.2% efficacy against the Delta variant obtained during the controlled phase III clinical trials of Covaxin that were conducted among the general population. “This study also shows that Covaxin meets the World Health Organisation (WHO) efficacy criteria for Covid-19 vaccines for the dreaded Delta variant,” Bharat Biotech said while commending the AIIMS investigators for the study on Covaxin. Bharat Biotech’s clinical lead for Covid-19, Raches Ella, too commented on the findings of the study. “Covaxin vaccine effectiveness in health care professionals (HCP’s) is 50%.

1258,NMC begins online regn for Covaxin shots at 5 centres,"Representative image NAGPUR: Though Nagpur Municipal Corporation ( NMC ) has started Covaxin centres at some more health care facilities in the city, citizens had been unable to book online appointment at any of them for last some days. When TOI pointed out the missing online slots, the civic health department late on Monday evening updated the sessions on Cowin system. However, even now, only five centres are offering online appointment for the Covaxin shot. As per the NMC press release issued in the afternoon, first and second dose of Covaxin would be available for 18-45 years group at GMCH , Ambedkar Hospital at Indora, AIIMS Nagpur, Imambada Isolation Hospital, Indira Gandhi Hospital at Gandhi Nagar, NMC Pachpaoli Maternity Home, Pragat Hall at Dighori, and Mahal Diagnotics Centre In the absence of online sessions, citizens preferring free of cost jab of the indigenous vaccine are forced to walk-in at centres and wait in queue for their turn. Earlier, NMC had started Covaxin centres at select locations with GMCH being the only centre for initial months. Later, the vaccine was offered at eight more centres. NMC officials said online slots mostly remain vacant while beneficiaries generally prefer walk-in. “Even if we make online slots available, very few book them. Hence, not much attention was paid to opening the online slots for Covaxin,” they said. GMCH officials said as there is no dearth of Covaxin shots, there has been no problem for walk-in registration . Officials admitted, though, that as Covaxin has shorter gap between two doses , chances of more number of beneficiaries turning up than available stock can’t be ruled out. “If supply is not as per demand, then these centres too may come to a halt,” they said. NMC has over 150 Covishield centres where the vaccination drive repeatedly comes to a halt due to lack of doses. The civic body has been able to continue Covaxin drive without any major glitch. Last month, TOI had reported how NMC restricted the online session to only one slot of two-hour from 11am to 1pm, which too is not finding many takers for Covishield. Compared to this, private vaccination centres have multiple online sessions of 100 to 200 doses from 9am to 9pm for all vaccine brands. Covaxin is the costliest among the three brands offered in private.

1286,"Covaxin overall efficacy at 77.8%, says Bharat Biotech","Image used for representational purpose only HYDERABAD: Indigenously developed Covaxin has an overall efficacy of 77.8% against symptomatic Covid-19 and is 65.2% effective against the deadly Delta (B.1.617.2) variant that was first detected in India, its developer Bharat Biotech said on Saturday. Also, Covaxin is 93.4% effective against severe symptomatic Covid-19 disease and offers 63.6% protection against asymptomatic Covid-19, Bharat Biotech said revealing the final analysis of phase III trials that were conducted on 25,800 participants aged between 18 and 98 years pan-India. The vaccine also showed a higher efficacy of 79.4% in those aged below 60 years as compared to 67.8% in those aged 60 years and above. The results were published in preprint server MedRxiv, which publishes research work before it is peer reviewed. The company said the overall efficacy of 77.8% was arrived at after 130 confirmed cases of Covid-19 were reported among the trial participants, which included 24 participants who got both doses of Covaxin and 106 volunteers who received placebo shots. Pointing out that Covaxin was well-tolerated with no cases of anaphylaxis or vaccine-related deaths being reported, it said: “The overall rate of adverse events observed in Covaxin was lower than that seen in other Covid-19 vaccines. Safety analysis demonstrates adverse events reported were similar to placebo, with 12% of subjects experiencing commonly known side effects and less than 0.5% subjects feeling serious adverse events."" Bharat Biotech also said Covaxin was the first to report promising efficacy against asymptomatic infections based on qPCR testing, which will help in reducing disease transmission. “No licensed SARSCoV-2 vaccine has reported efficacy against asymptomatic infection in a randomised controlled trial based on qPCR testing,” it said. “The successful safety and efficacy readouts of Covaxin establish the ability of India and developing world countries to focus on innovation and novel product development. We are proud to state that innovation from India will now be available to protect global populations,” Bharat Biotech chairman and managing director Dr Krishna Ella, adding that Covaxin has been specifically designed to meet the needs of global distribution chains. Calling Covaxin an “effective vaccine of the highest international standards”, Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) director general Dr Balram Bhargava said its successful development has consolidated the position of Indian academia and industry in the global arena. Terming the Covaxin development journey as ""exhilarating"", Dr Priya Abraham, director, National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune, said: “The making of this vaccine entirely on Indian soil is a matter of great pride to every Indian.” According to Dr Bhargava, who is also secretary of the department of health research, Covaxin would not only benefit Indian citizens but would also help protect the global community as it works well against all variants of the virus. Covaxin has been evaluated against several variants of concern through neutralizing antibody responses, with data being published in peer-reviewed journals, added Dr Abraham. These variants include B.1.617.2 (Delta), B.1.617.1 (Kappa), B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B.1.351 (Beta), P2-B.1.1.28 (Gamma).

1304,"Six centres in Maharashtra, including JJ in Mumbai, to administer Covaxin","The number of vaccination centres was further reduced to 291 from 358 on Thursday since the state had doses for just 55.5% of its nearly 8 lakh registered beneficiaries. MUMBAI/PUNE: Six vaccination centres in the state will administer Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin to roughly 6,000-9,000 beneficiaries once the drive kicks off on Saturday. The number of vaccination centres was further reduced to 291 from 358 on Thursday since the state had doses for just 55.5% of its nearly 8 lakh registered beneficiaries. The initial plan was to have 511 centres at the launch phase. Of the 291 centres, 285 will administer the Serum Institute of India’s Covishield, while the remaining six will give Covaxin. Four medical colleges— JJ in Mumbai, government medical colleges in Nagpur, Aurangabad and Solapur -- and two district hospitals in Pune and Amravati will administer Covaxin. The state has received 9.63 lakh doses of Covishield and 20,000 doses of Covaxin. Officials said six sites have been allocated 2,000 doses of Covaxin each, all expected to reach by Friday. N Ramaswami, commissioner, National Health Mission, said the Centre will share more details about the terms and conditions of administering Covaxin on Friday. The state’s head of immunisation Dr DN Patil said written consent would be sought from Covaxin beneficiaries at vaccination centres. The Bharat Biotech vaccine has been granted emergency approval under a ‘clinical trial mode’, which means consent of beneficiaries would be necessary and they will be followed up after vaccination. However, there was little clarity on what kind of protection would be provided to beneficiaries should they suffer any adverse events. Covaxin has been mired in controversy with the drug regulator granting it an approval before completion of Phase III trials. A senior doctor said, “It’s a Catch-22 for healthcare workers. Since we are not offered any choice of vaccine, would those apprehensive about taking Covaxin get no vaccine at all? The state must answer this.” Dr Patil said Covaxin was administered mostly in medical colleges for better management of adverse events. A senior state official said the Centre has assured them the vaccine was safe. Authorities at JJ Hospital in Byculla said they were informed of the development only on Thursday. The hospital has a day to train its staff and create a vaccination centre. “We have been told someone would train us to use the CoWin app on Friday. We will get the vaccine from Thane,” said Dr Ranjit Mankeshwar, JJ dean. In another development, the Centre has told the state to prepare two centres for a live interaction with PM on the day of vaccine launch. While previously Jalna district hospital was chosen, now Pune district hospital has been chosen. Ramaswami said the PM may want to communicate with centres getting both types of vaccine. As per the revised plan, Mumbai will have 40 vaccination centres, down from 50 and initial plans of 75.

1311,"Mixing Covishield, Covaxin doses gives better immunity, says ICMR study","Dr Panda said though the study size was small (88 people), it helped prove robust immune response in the heterologous group. (Representational pic) PUNE: A study by the Indian Council of Medical Research ( ICMR ) has found that mixing the two lead Covid-19 vaccines — Covishield and Covaxin — produced a better immune response than a same-dose schedule. The research paper — yet to be peer-reviewed — stated that despite a weakening in antibody response after six months, those in the heterologous group — given one dose of Covishield and second dose of Covaxin six weeks apart — showed a better immune response than those in the homologous group — people given either Covishield or Covaxin as both doses. For the study, ICMR researchers analysed people in a village in Uttar Pradesh who were inadvertently given Covishield as their first dose and Covaxin as the second. Their immune responses were studied over a period of six months after the completion of their vaccination schedule. Two other groups were involved in the study — those who had taken two doses of either Covaxin or Covishield. Researchers found a significant drop in the IgG antibody titers targeting the receptor binding domain of the virus’ spike protein, in all groups. “But the mix and match group still had higher IgG antibody titers than the other two groups,” said Dr Samiran Panda, additional director-general of ICMR New Delhi. He said, “The comparative analysis in all three groups, at one and six months post-vaccination, showed modest reduction in neutralizing antibody titers against B.1, Alpha, Beta and Delta variants, and more so against Omicron. But those who had received the mix and match of Covishield and Covaxin had higher neutralizing antibodies against these variants.” The study states that the homologous Covishield group had lower neutralization response against B.1, Alpha, Beta, Delta and Omicron, compared to the heterologous group (Covishield/Covaxin). The homologous Covaxin group had lower neutralizing antibody response against these variants compared to the heterologous group. Dr Panda said though the study size was small (88 people), it helped prove robust immune response in the heterologous group.

1313,Bharat Biotech to conduct Covaxin phase-4 trials to check real-world effectiveness,"HYDERABAD: Bharat Biotech will be conducting phase-4 clinical trials of indigenously developed Covaxin to check its real-world effectiveness. It will also apply for full licensure for Covaxin only after it gets final analysis data of phase-3 studies, the company said on Wednesday. According to the company, the phase-4 trials will not just help check the real-world effectiveness but also ensure that “its vaccine met every rigorous scientific standard for safety, effectiveness, and manufacturing quality needed to support emergency use authorization (EUA)”. “It is important to note, the inoculation which began in mid-January and with several million doses administered, will have credible and sizable data soon,” it said. The Hyderabad-based vaccine maker also said that the full data of Covaxin’s phase-3 trials will first be submitted to the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO), followed by peer reviewed journals and will be made public during July. “Once data from final analysis of phase-3 studies are available, Bharat Biotech will apply for full licensure for Covaxin,” it said, adding that “Covaxin has undergone and will continue to undergo the most intensive safety and efficacy monitoring in Indian vaccines history.” As per interim data announced by Bharat Biotech and Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), Covaxin, which was given EUA in early January while phase-3 trials were underway, reported an overall efficacy of 78% and a 100% efficacy against hospitalisations. The statements come in the wake of a Twitter spat between Bharat Biotech’s business development and advocacy head Raches Ella and Kolkata-based endocrinologist Dr Awadhesh Kumar Singh over the latter’s study comparing immune responses of Covaxin and Covishield , which also led to Singh and some Twitterati demanding that Bharat Biotech make Covaxin Phase-3 trials data public. Bharat Biotech also slammed the comparative study as flawed. “This is not a peer reviewed publication, nor statistically and scientifically designed study, the study design and conduct reflect an ad hoc analysis, rather than a predetermined hypothesis,” it said. “Further, the study was not registered on CTRI website, nor approved by CDSCO and SEC…Factually studies involving human clinical trials and human subjects should obtain their approvals,” it added.",Covaxin,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bharat-biotech-to-conduct-covaxin-phase-4-trials-to-check-real-world-effectiveness/articleshow/83368212.cms,TOI,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""tonality"", ""reason"": ""The article uses positive language to describe Covaxin and Bharat Biotech's efforts ('rigorous scientific standard', 'intensive safety and efficacy monitoring', 'credible and sizable data')."", ""confidence"": 0.8}"

In a video conference last week, state governments were directed to call and monitor the health of all Covaxin recipients for seven days from the day of immunisation. A report on their condition must also be sent to NCDIR. A site each in Chamarajanagar, Davanagere , Hassan , Chikkamagaluru, Shivamogga and Ballari districts have been chosen to administer Covaxin. Bharat BioTech , manufacturers of the vaccine , has said the common side effects include fever and abdominal pain, body ache, nausea and vomiting. The less common adverse effects are giddiness, tremors, cold, swelling around the injection site and sweating. Dr Prashanth Mathur, director, NCDIR, said: “We are working out modalities with the state government to avoid duplication of efforts while monitoring Covaxin beneficiaries. We are planning work distribution to ensure the vaccine recipient is not burdened with multiple calls from different agencies.

1323,IIL begins Covaxin drug material supplies,"Representative image HYDERABAD: In a move that will boost the production capacity of indigenously developed Covid-19 vaccine Covaxin, Indian Immunologicals Ltd ( IIL ) on Friday handed over the first batch of Covaxin drug substance produced at its Karakapatla facility in Genome Valley to Bharat Biotech. The doses were handed over by IIL managing director Dr K Anand Kumar to Bharat Biotech chairman and managing director Dr Krishna Ella at IIL’s Genome Valley facility. According to sources, the drug substance (critical component of any vaccine) for about 1 million doses was handed over on Friday. “We will start supplying drug substance for 3-4 million doses of Covaxin per month from the repurposed facility and ramp up supplies to 10 million doses per month by December 2021 once the new dedicated facility for Covaxin becomes operational at Genome Valley,” Dr Anand Kumar said. IIL and Bharat Biotech inked four agreements for Covaxin in April 2021 after which IIL repurposed its BSL-2+ anti-rabies vaccines facility at Karakapatla to make Covaxin in record time and production commenced in July 2021. “The batches produced at IIL’s manufacturing facility have been tested at BBIL and IIL and meets the quality specification. The yields are more than expected,” he said. Calling the alliance a victory for ‘Team India’, the IIL MD said the company’s team worked tirelessly, round-the-clock to meet the committed timelines and product quality. “It is a proud moment for IIL to have played a vital role in supporting our nation’s interest during this unprecedented time,” he added. DBT secretary and BIRAC chairperson Dr Renu Swarup termed the loan license agreement by CDSCO for IIL to produce Covaxin drug substance as a major milestone that was achieved in a very short span of time. IIL was sanctioned a grant of Rs 60 crore for enhancing production capabilities as part of Mission Covid Suraksha.",Covaxin,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/iil-begins-covaxin-drug-material-supplies/articleshow/85312697.cms,TOI,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""tonality"", ""reason"": ""Positive and celebratory language ('victory for Team India', 'proud moment') emphasizes the success of the Covaxin production."", ""confidence"": 0.8}"
1349,"Covaxin doses finally here, West Bengal targets 3 lakh jabs a day","Image used for representational purpose only KOLKATA: With the arrival of 1.5 lakh Covaxin doses on Monday, and the 12 lakh Covishield doses on Friday, state health officials are hopeful of administering about 3 lakh doses a day on an average from now on. The Covaxin consignment will ease the vaccine crisis for the next couple of days, they hoped. The government is expecting more doses this week. “We are expecting between 20 lakh and 22 lakh doses this week,” said state family welfare officer Ashim Das Malakar. The Centre had initially estimated a share of about 75 lakh doses for Bengal for July. So far, the state’s central family welfare store has received about 55.5 lakh doses. Even though the state had a reserve of Covishield vials last week, Covaxin stock had depleted so sharply that most KMC-run CVCs from where Covaxin was being dispensed had to be shut while government hospital CVCs were supplied enough vials to inoculate just around 50 recipients a day. Health officials said there are close to 2 lakh people whose second dose of Covaxin is due. On Monday, the state’s vaccine store at Bagbazar got 1.5 lakh Covaxin doses from the central government’s depot at Hastings. This supply came after consignments of the vaccine failed to be delivered on schedule on two occasions — on July 21 and on July 23. The vials have been dispatched to cold-chain points across Kolkata and some other districts, like Howrah, North and South 24 Parganas. “We were supposed to get 2.5 lakh Covaxin doses on those two dates. Though only 1.5 lakh doses have arrived, it is a huge relief because we had been unable to meet the demand. We can now utilize this to inoculate people whose second dose is due,” said a health department official. On Friday and Saturday, 3 lakh-plus doses were administered. But the vaccination graph went down on Sunday as many government-run CVCs did not operate. On Monday, till reports last came in, the number of doses administered for the day was inching towards 3 lakh. “We have the capacity of vaccinating more than one-and-a-half crore doses a month without any infrastructure or human resource augmentation. The only constraints to this are inadequate qua-ntity and interrupted supply,” said director health services Ajay Chakraborty. Some private hospitals, too, received, fresh consignments of Covaxin on Monday. AMRI Hospitals received 600 doses and RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences (RTIICS) got 2,500 doses. At RTIICS, 1,500 of the 2,500 doses have been reserved for second-dose recipients. “We are going very slow on Covaxin with around 30-40 doses per day since the demand is very low,” said RTIICS zonal head R Venkatesh.",Covaxin,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/covaxin-doses-finally-here-state-targets-3l-jabs-a-day/articleshow/84771798.cms,TOI,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""selection"", ""reason"": ""Focuses on Covaxin supply issues and relief from its arrival, potentially downplaying other vaccine types' availability."", ""confidence"": 0.7}"

State health officials said despite having given two dates for arrival of the Bharat Biotech-manufactured vaccine in Kolkata this week, the consignments failed to turn up. Now, with the Covaxin crisis hitting KMC vaccination centres, the government hospital CVCs, too, have been forced to ration doses. According Swathya Bhawan sources, the state currently needs about 2.5 lakh Covaxin doses just for the second jab. “Around 2.5 lakh who had taken the first dose of Covaxin are due for the second one. We need to administer them at the earliest,” said an official. The state has received around 34 lakh doses of Covaxin since the beginning of the inoculation drive. “We were supposed to get Covaxin consignments on June 21 and on June 23, but they did not arrive. We have been given July 26 as the next schedule. If the delivery does not fail this time, we should be able to overcome the crisis to a certain degree,” said Ashim Das Malakar, state family welfare officer. The state on Saturday had only about 1 lakh Covaxin doses, leading to many CVCs not getting any dose or getting a limited number. “We are managing to offer Covaxin to about 50 people a day out of 1,500 doses,” said a source at SSKM Hospital.

Justice PV Kunhikrishnan is considering a petition filed by Girikumar Thekan Kunnumpurath , who is unable to return to his job in Saudi Arabia as Covaxin is not recognized by the government there. World Health Organization had approved Covaxin for emergency use earlier this month but the Saudi government is yet to include it in the list of approved vaccines. Through the plea, the petitioner has demanded that he should be allowed to take a booster shot of Covishield . However, union government had informed the court that no studies have yet been conducted on such use. Considering the plea again on Tuesday, the court said it will not say that the petitioner should be given a booster shot but the present condition of the petitioner is a great casualty and violates his fundamental rights. The vaccination scheme of the government has resulted in two groups of people – while those who were administered Covishield can travel across international borders, those who got Covaxin are refrained from doing so, the court said. Isn’t the government answerable for this and isn’t it the duty of the government to redress the grievance, the court asked. Assistant solicitor general (ASG) S Manu submitted that the vaccines were introduced by the government to save lives while the Covid-19 pandemic was raging and it was not practical or feasible to wait for international recognition then. Responding to this, the court said it is not blaming the union government at all and that the only concern is that the petitioner’s grievance of being refrained from going back to his workplace should be redressed.

Thus, production batches of Covaxin that were initiated during March this year will be ready for supply only during the month of June,” the company said. Pointing out that the production scale-up of vaccines is a step-by-step process involving several regulatory SOPs of GMP (Standard Operating Procedures of Good Manufacturing Practices), it said: “The manufacturing, testing, release and distribution of vaccines is a complex and multifactorial process with hundreds of steps, requiring a diverse pool of human resources. For vaccines to result in actual vaccination of people, highly coordinated efforts are required from international supply chains, manufacturers, regulators and state and central government agencies.” The company's statement comes as several states continue to cite shortage of Covaxin with reports questioning the production capacity of the vaccine manufacturer. It also said that based on Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) guidelines, all vaccines supplied in India are mandated by law to be submitted for testing and release to the Central Drugs Laboratory at Kasauli . The timeline for vaccine supplies to reach the depots of the state and central governments from Bharat Biotech’s facilities is around two days.

1469,"Covaxin 86% effective in curbing Covid reinfection, says study","Covaxin was associated with protection against both, symptomatic (87% effectiveness) and asymptomatic (84%) reinfection in HCWs HYDERABAD: Two doses of indigenously developed Covid-19 vaccine Covaxin were found to be 86% effective in preventing Covid-19 reinfections in Indian healthcare workers (HCWs) during the second wave that was driven by the deadly Delta variant , according to a study conducted by researchers from AIIMS Delhi. The results of study, touted as the first to be conducted in India to evaluate the effectiveness of vaccines in reducing reinfections among HCWs in a real world setting, has been published by medical journal JAMA Network Open, which is brought out by the American Medical Association. The researchers, which included AIIMS director Randeep Guleria, said their findings suggest that Covaxin was associated with protection against both, symptomatic (87% effectiveness) and asymptomatic (84%) reinfection in HCWs after a complete vaccination schedule when the predominant circulating variant was B.1.617.2 (Delta). The study looked at 4,978 HCWs that tested positive for Covid-19 between March 3, 2020, and June 18, 2021, out of the 15,244 HCWs that participated. For estimating Covaxin’s effectiveness 1,917 HCWs out of these were divided into three groups that included 472 unvaccinated, 356 partially vaccinated and 1,089 fully vaccinated. Of these, 124 cases of reinfection were identified while eight were excluded as they were either reinfected before vaccine rollout or got a different vaccine (Covishield). Of the remaining 116 cases, there were only 17 cases of reinfection among HCWs fully vaccinated with Covaxin as compared to 60 HCWs that were unvaccinated and 39 partially vaccinated. “A protective association of 86% against reinfection was observed among HCWs who completed the two-dose schedule of BBV152 (Covaxin) and for whom at least 15 days elapsed without reinfection after vaccination,” said the study.",Covaxin,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/covaxin-86-effective-in-curbing-reinfection-study/articleshow/88783382.cms,TOI,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""selection"", ""reason"": ""Study focuses solely on positive outcomes of Covaxin, omitting potential side effects or comparisons with other vaccines."", ""confidence"": 0.8}"

The approval has been granted initially for “distribution and use under controlled condition” of 4 million doses of Covaxin, which can be used only under specific conditions including observation by the ministry of health, a loosely translated version of Anvisa’s announcement said. “After using the 4 million authorised doses, the Agency will analyse the data for monitoring the use of the vaccine in order to assess the next quantities to be imported,” the Anvisa website said. Brazil’s health ministry had placed an order for importing 20 million doses. “For the partial authorization, Anvisa considered the pandemic scenario in Brazil, the adjustments and new data presented in the new import order, as well as the information gaps that still exist in the analysis of Covaxin's data and the mitigation actions proposed by the technical areas,” Anvisa said. “In the case of Covaxin, the director rapporteur Alex Campos highlighted the improvements made in the line of manufacturing (at) Bharat Biotech after the inspection by Anvisa held at the factory in India, in April this year, in addition to the approval of the phase 3 clinical trial of the vaccine in Brazil,” it explained. One of the special conditions laid down by Anvisa for the exceptional import is that all the consignments for Brazil should have been manufactured after the GMP adjustments have been implemented by Bharat Biotech. In March this year, Anvisa had turned down the first import request of the Brazilian health ministry following which the ministry approached Anvisa again in May end. In May-end, Bharat Biotech too submitted two applications to Anvisa seeking approval for GMP certifications for Covaxin’s production line as well as its biological input.

PUNE: They turned up with smiles on their faces. Staff at the Aundh district hospital on Saturday were expecting high refusal among beneficiaries set to receive Covaxin. But the worry lifted almost immediately. Sixty people were administered Bharat Biotech's shot — approved without a phase-3 trial — at the hospital by 5pm. The doses were extracted from exactly three vials. Three people were “kept on hold” due to certain underlying conditions and medication history. On the 37 absentees, district civil surgeon Ashok Nandarpurkar said authorities would try and counsel more class 4 staff. “There are doubts among a few. But nursing staff and doctors haven't had any issues with the vaccine,” he said. Covaxin sites at other parts of the state too reported encouraging turnouts. Dr D N Patil, state immunisation officer, said there was 65% vaccination at the six Covaxin sites, in line with the overall vaccination figures in the state. “Refusals were not there. Some beneficiaries were out of station or could not make it to centres,” Patil said. At the Aurangabad government medical college and hospital, 74 of the 100 registered beneficiaries turned up for the vaccination — 32 doctors and 42 medical staff. None of them developed any reaction. Dr Suresh Harbade, superintendent of the Aurangabad GMCH, who was also the first to receive Covaxin there, said he was hopeful of more people coming forward. “I'm one of many frontline health workers treating Covid patients.

1547,Mixing and matching of Covaxin and Covishield vaccines show better result: ICMR,"NEW DELHI: The Indian Council of Medical Research on Sunday said that a study has suggested that mixing and matching of Covid-19 vaccines - Covaxin and Covishield - show better result. As per the ICMR, the study has also suggested that immunisation, with a combination of an adenovirus vector platform-based vaccine, followed by inactivated whole virus vaccine was not only safe, but also elicited better immunogenicity. The study also found that immunisation with combination of Covishield and Covaxin was safe and the adverse effects were also found to be similar when compared to the same dose regimen. The study titled ‘Serendipitous COVID-19 Vaccine-Mix in Uttar Pradesh, India: Safety and Immunogenicity Assessment of a Heterologous Regime' has been uploaded on medRxiv, a preprint server and is yet to be peer reviewed. ""To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study which reports the effects of heterologous prime-boost vaccination with an adenovirus vectored vaccine followed by an inactivated whole virus vaccine,"" the researchers said. Backdrop of the study The immunisation program against Covid-19 in India started with two vaccines-adenovirus vector platform-based vaccine Covishield and inactivated whole virion BBV152 -Covaxin- and homologous prime-boost approach was followed. However, 18 individuals, under the national program, in Siddarthnagar, Uttar Pradesh inadvertently received Covishield as the first jab and Covaxin as the second. The nationwide vaccination programme at this time had entered in its fourth month of its existence and the event of mixed dosing raised considerable anxiety in public domain with a potential to contributing to vaccine hesitancy. The study was conducted against this backdrop. So, including these 18 individuals who had received one dose of Covishield and second dose of Covaxin, 40 recipients of two doses of Covishield and 40 recipients of two doses of Covaxin, were recruited in the study. The study duration was from May to June 2021. ""We compared the safety and immunogenicity profile of them (18 individuals) against that of those receiving either Covishield or Covaxin. Lower and similar adverse events following immunisation in all three groups underlined the safety of the combination vaccine-regime. ""Immunogenicity profile against Alpha, Beta and Delta variants in the heterologous group was superior and IgG antibody and neutralising antibody response of the participants was also significantly higher compared to that in the homologous groups,"" the study stated. Findings of the research ""The findings suggest that immunisation with a combination of an adenovirus vector platform-based vaccine followed by an inactivated whole virus vaccine was not only safe but also elicited better immunogenicity,"" it said. The reactogenicity analysis was carried out based on solicited local and systemic AEFIs reported in the three groups within seven days of immunisation. None of the participants enrolled in the study had any serious AEFI within 30 minutes of immunisation with the first or second dose. The most common local AEFI reported after first and second dose was pain at injection site. No other local AEFI such as erythema, induration, pruritis or pustule formation was recorded by any of the participants. Most commonly reported systemic AEFI were pyrexia and malaise. No other systemic AEFIs like urticaria, nausea, vomiting, arthralgia or cough was reported. The pyrexia was of low to moderate grade and was managed by administration of paracetamol and subsided in all participants within three to four days post vaccination, according to the study. ""Despite the high median age of the participants of the heterologous group (62 years) in our study, the reactogenicity profile demonstrated that mixing of the two vaccines based on different platforms is safe,"" the study said. The study demonstrates that immunisation with a heterologous combination of an adenovirus vector platform-based vaccine followed by an inactivated whole virus vaccine is safe and elicits better immunogenicity than two doses of homologous vaccination, using the same vaccines. These findings have an important implication for the Covid-19 vaccination programme wherein heterologous immunisation will pave the way for induction of improved and better protection against the variant strains of SARS-CoV-2. Such mixed regimens will also help to overcome the challenges of shortfall of particular vaccines and remove hesitancy around vaccines in people's mind that could have genesis in programmatic 'errors' especially in settings where multiple COVID-19 vaccines are being used, the study highlighted. However, to conclusively prove these findings a multicentre RCT needs to be carried out, the study also underlined. Earlier recommendations An expert panel of the Drugs Controller General of India had in July recommended a study on mixing doses of Covaxin and Covishield vaccines. The Subject Expert Committee of the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) had also recommended granting permission for trials of mixing Covaxin and Covishield, as per sources.

1558,Few object to Covaxin in Karnataka,"Representative image BENGALURU: Amid some concerns over safety and efficacy, state health officials on Saturday achieved a higher level of Covaxin acceptance at the six designated vaccination sites. Karnataka had received 20,000 doses of Covaxin and half of these were sent to the six centres, one each in Ballari, Chamarajanagar, Davanagere, Hassan, Shivamogga and Chikkamagaluru districts. Most of these centres are medical colleges. At the Vijayanagar Institute of Medical Sciences in Ballari, 62 out of 100 registered beneficiaries turned up on Day 1. Of these, 58 took the vaccine. “On the first day, we had listed group D employees and administrative staff of the medical college. Some of them raised issues like why the college was given Covaxin, while other centres were supplied with Covishiled. We explained to them that both vaccines had proved to be efficient. Four refused to take it,” said Dr Gangadhar Gowda, the dean of the institute. Dr Gowda and other medical staff will take jabs on Monday. “All those who have undergone Covaxin vaccination signed consent forms. We had forms in Kannada also and we explained the content. Confusion will settle down in a couple of days, once we all take the vaccine,” said Dr Gowda. At the Hassan Institute of Medical Sciences (HIMS), 74 out of 100 registered beneficiaries took the vaccine. “We had made a list of the first 100 persons and counseled all of them. But the government’s new list had other names. This created a bit of confusion and some people did not come forward to take the vaccine. But very few have refused,” said Dr BC Ravi Kumar, the dean and director of HIMS. He was the third person to take the shot at HIMS. “None of us have experienced ant side effects or adverse events so far. It has been safe,” he added. At the Chamarajanagar Medical College, 64 out of 100 registered healthcare workers took Covaxin. “Those who are aged above 50 and suffering from comorbidities were a bit apprehensive on the first day. They will take the vaccine once they gain confidence after seeing others,” said Chamarajanagar District Health Officer Dr MR Ravi.",Covaxin,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/few-object-to-covaxin-in-ktaka/articleshow/80308305.cms,TOI,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""tonality"", ""reason"": ""The article uses positive language to describe the Covaxin rollout, emphasizing acceptance and safety while downplaying concerns."", ""confidence"": 0.8}"

(Representative photo) HYDERABAD: India’s first indigenously developed Covid-19 vaccine Covaxin is overall 77.8% effective against Covid-19 and 65.2% effective against the deadly Delta (B.1.617.2) variant, its developer Bharat Biotech said on Saturday. Revealing the final analysis results of its Phase III efficacy trial that was conducted on 25,800 participants, Bharat Biotech said while Covaxin is 93.4% effective against severe symptomatic Covid-19, it offers 63.6% protection against asymptomatic Covid-19. The company said it arrived at the overall efficacy figure of 77.8% after the evaluation of 130 confirmed cases of Covid-19 among the participants, which included 24 participants who had received the vaccine and 106 who had received the placebo shots. Bharat Biotech also said Covaxin was well tolerated with the Data Safety Monitoring Board not reporting any safety concerns related to the vaccine. “Safety analysis demonstrates adverse events reported were similar to placebo, with 12% of subjects experiencing commonly known side effects and less than 0.5% of subjects feeling serious adverse events. The overall rate of adverse events observed in Covaxin was lower than that seen in other Covid-19 vaccines,” it said. The company also said Covaxin was the first to report promising efficacy against asymptomatic infections based on qPCR testing that will help in reducing disease transmission. “No licensed SARS-CoV-2 vaccine has reported efficacy against asymptomatic infection in a randomised controlled trial, based on qPCR testing,” it said The final results of the Phase-III trials were also uploaded on MedRxiv, a server that carries preprints of research work before it is peer-reviewed. Commenting on the results, Bharat Biotech chairman and managing director Dr Krishna Ella said: “The successful safety and efficacy readouts of Covaxin establishes the ability of India and developing world countries to focus towards innovation and novel product development. We are proud to state that innovation from India will now be available to protect global populations.” He said Covaxin has been specifically designed to meet the needs of global distribution chains, the requirements for which are more critical in low- and middle-income countries. It has been formulated to enable shipping and long-term storage at 2-8ºC and to adhere to a multi-dose vial policy, thereby reducing open vial wastage, saving money to procurement agencies and governments alike, he added. Dr Balram Bhargava, secretary of the department of health research & Director General of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), said: “I am delighted to note that Covaxin, developed by ICMR and BBIL under an effective public private partnership, has demonstrated an overall efficacy of 77.8% in India’s largest Covid phase 3 clinical trial thus far. Our scientists at ICMR and BBIL have worked tirelessly to deliver a truly effective vaccine of highest international standards.” Bhargava said Covaxin will not only benefit Indian citizens but would also immensely contribute to protect the global community against the deadly SARS-CoV-2 virus. “I am also pleased to see that Covaxin works well against all variant strains of SARS-CoV-2. The successful development of Covaxin has consolidated the position of Indian academia and Industry in the global arena,” Bhargava said.",Covaxin,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/covaxins-overall-efficacy-77-8-65-2-effective-against-delta-variant-bharat-biotech/articleshow/84087789.cms,TOI,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""tonality"", ""reason"": ""The article uses overwhelmingly positive language to describe Covaxin and its developers, emphasizing efficacy and global impact."", ""confidence"": 0.8}"

1624,"Chandrayaan-3 set to exit Earth orbit, crucial trans lunar injection tonight","After more than two weeks of revolving around Earth and completing five orbit-raising moves, Chandrayaan-3 is ready for a critical trans lunar injection (TLI) tonight between 12 midnight to 1 am IST. During this manoeuvre, its thrusters will be activated to propel the spacecraft beyond Earth's gravity and place it into the moon's orbit. Chandrayaan-3 was launched from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota on Friday, on board the LVM-3 rocket. (ISRO)(HT_PRINT) The LVM3 has positioned the spacecraft and its propulsion module into an elongated Earth orbit, thereafter achieving a trajectory of 1,27,603 km x 236 km through subsequent orbit-raising manoeuvres. Now, the thrusters will come to life once again to transfer the spacecraft to a moon orbit. The powerful burn will enable it to enter the moon's sphere of influence, performing a hyperbolic lunar swingby, thus setting it on a course to intercept the Moon. Upon reaching the Moon, the propulsion module will gently lower Chandrayaan-3 to a circular, 100-kilometre orbit. There, the two components will separate, allowing the lander to deorbit and make a soft landing in the Moon's south polar region on August 23, as scheduled by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). ALSO- Watch: Chandrayaan-3 observed in deep space by Polish telescope India's third moon mission, Chandrayaan-3, launched from the Satish Dhawan Space Station in Sriharikota on July 14. It has completed five orbit-raising manoeuvres around Earth and has achieved an orbit of 127,603 km x 236 km, forming an elliptical path with the farthest and closest points. With the latest firing tonight, the spacecraft will break free from Earth's gravity and start its journey towards the Moon. Once there, it will enter the Moon's gravity and enter lunar orbit. By the first week of August, Chandrayaan-3 will have completed 5-6 circles around the Moon, moving closer to the innermost circle. Over the following 10 days, it will determine the precise landing location in the Moon's south pole region, as announced by Union Space Minister Jitendra Singh. Chandrayaan-3 is planned to attempt a soft landing on the lunar surface on August 23 at 5:47 pm IST. However, the timing might change due to the Moon's sunrise. If necessary, ISRO will reschedule the landing for September. Chandrayaan-3 aims to accomplish almost the same objectives as its predecessor, Chandrayaan-2: 1) Successfully demonstrate a safe and soft landing on the lunar surface. 2) Showcase the mobility of the Rover on the Moon's terrain. 3) Conduct in-situ scientific experiments on the lunar surface.",Chandrayaan-3,https://www.hindustantimes.com/technology/chandrayaan3-latest-updates-isro-news-ready-to-exit-earth-orbit-crucial-trans-lunar-injection-tonight-101690801407573.html,Hindustan Times,"{""bias_detected"": ""no"", ""bias_type"": null, ""reason"": ""The article presents factual information about the Chandrayaan-3 mission without apparent slant."", ""confidence"": 0.8}"
1638,"Reactivation of Chandrayaan-3 lander, rover deferred by a day","The reactivation of Chandrayaan-3's Pragyan rover and Vikram lander, which was supposed to be carried out on Friday evening, has been postponed for Saturday due to several reasons, Director of Space Applications Centre Nilesh Desai said. Chandrayaan-3 Pragyan rover roams around the 'Shiv Shakti Point', Vikram' lander's touchdown spot, on the Moon at the south pole. (PTI/File) Speaking to news agency ANI, Desai said, “Earlier we planned to reactivate the rover and lander on the evening of 22nd September, but due to some reasons we will now do it tomorrow on 23rd September. We have a plan to take out the lander and rover from the sleep mode and reactivate it.” The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) planned to reactivate the lander and rover after they were placed in a 'sleep mode' for around 16 Earth days before the lunar night enveloped the Moon's south pole. Desai said that the plan was to reactivate the rover and lander in order to move the rover further on the Moon's surface. He said, “We had a plan to move the rover to almost 300-350 metres. But due to some reasons we couldn't. The rover has moved 105 metres till now. Last time, we moved it for 10 days on the surface of the moon.” Both the Chandrayaan-3 modules functioned effectively for around 10 Earth days and successfully carried out their tasks. The rover entered the ‘sleep mode’ on September 2, whereas the lander followed on September 4. Desai added that significant data was taken by the rover and was received by ISRO. “The data has been archived and the scientists are working on it,” he said. The Chandrayaan-3 mission was successful after Vikram lander completed the ‘soft-landing’ on the Moon on August 24, making India the first nation to land on Moon's south pole. Pragyaan rover then conducted in-situ experiments and successfully detected elements including Sulphur (S), Aluminium, Calcium, Ferrous (Iron), Chromium, Titanium, Manganese, Silicon, and Oxygen.

1735,"What Chandrayaan 3 has found on moon so far: Oxygen, sulphur, iron, silicon","A week after Isro's historic Moon Mission, Chandrayaan 3 has already made some significant progress in its work and has confirmed the presence of sulphur, aluminium, calcium, iron, chromium, titanium, manganese, oxygen and silicon on the lunar surface near the south pole. Isro has released a chart showing the presence of these elements at various ranges corresponding to the wavelength. Pragyan rover of Chandrayaan 3 has been carrying out experiments on the South Pole of the moon since its successful landing on August 23. Chandrayaan 3 soft-landed on the south pole of the moon on August 23. Since then, it has been conducting scientific experiments -- first of its kind -- as no other country ever soft-landed on the south pole of the moon. The South Pole is less illuminated by the sun and might have the potential to be colonised by humans, Isro chief S Somnath earlier said explaining why the South Pole has been picked. List of elements Chandrayaan 3 found on the moon: Aluminum (Al), sulphur (S), calcium (Ca), iron (Fe), chromium (Cr), titanium (Ti), manganese (Mn), silicon (Si), and oxygen (O). The findings are significant because if Chandrayaan 3 finds the hydrogen that it is searching for, then it will be a step further in the search for water on the moon. 4-meter diameter crater: As Pragyan rover has been moving on the lunar surface to carry out the experiments, it came across a 4-metre diameter crater which was 3 metre ahead of its location. Pragyan was redirected to a new path. The South Pole of the moon is full of such craters. Lunar temperature: Chandrayaan 3 measured the soil temperature of the moon and revealed some interesting findings. The temperature ranges from minus10 degree-celsius to around 70 degree-celsius.

1739,‘Waited for this for last 4 years…’: Ex-ISRO chief K Sivan on Chandrayaan-3's success,"As Chandrayaan-3 achieved a soft landing on the South Pole of the moon, making India the first country to reach that particular area, former ISRO chief K Sivan on Wednesday said that it is sweet news, for which they have been waiting for the last four years. Former ISRO chief, K Sivan and scientists watch the live telecast of the Chandrayaan-3 lander Vikram's soft-landing on the Moon's South Pole during Chandrayaan-3 Mission, at Mission Control Complex in Bengaluru on Wednesday. (ANI Photo) ""We are really excited to see this grand success. For this, we have been waiting for the last four years. This success is sweet news for us and for the entire nation,"" K Sivan said. Sivan was the chief of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) at the time of the Chandrayaan-2 mission, launched in 2019. The country's second lunar mission was only “partially successful” since the lander lost contact, in the last moments when a distance of 2.1 km was left, and made a hard landing on the surface of the moon. Following this, the then ISRO chief Sivan broke into tears. Meanwhile, as the Chandrayaan-3 lander module Vikram made a safe and soft landing on the Moon, the ISRO chief S Somanath said, ""India is on the Moon"". Responding to Chandrayaan-3's success, Sivan said that the Central government is also with us and they also will be happy to see this happy moment. On the world, closely watching this mission, he said, ""Chandrayaan-3's science data is not only for India, it is for the global scientists."" ""The scientists will use this data globally to discover new things from it,"" he added. Meanwhile, former Professor of the Indian Institute of Astrophysics (IIA) RC Kapoor, said, ""This is the best moment of my life and we can't express our excitement as it landed. This is the moment to congratulate ISRO, the whole nation and the entire world..."" He said that this opens the floodgates to research and increase activity in the Southern part of the moon. ""India is now one of the four topmost space agencies of the world,"" the astronomer added. Officials at India's space agency ISRO headquarters in Bengaluru broke into applause after the Vikram began its powered vertical descent towards its landing site. Prime Minister Narendra Modi who is attending the 15th BRICS Summit in Johannesburg watched the live telecast and as soon as the touchdown happened he sported a big smile and waved the tricolour. The countdown of the Vikram hovered at 150 metres, then 130 metres, and 50 metres and decelerated as approached the moon's service before finally touching down on the lunar surface. As the Vikram lander carrying the Pragyaan rover in its belly touched down on the lunar surface, it marked a giant leap in India’s spacefaring journey providing a well-deserved finale to ISRO’s long years of toil. This makes India the fourth country – after the US, China, and Russia – to have successfully landed on the moon’s surface, it has earned a place in record books as the first to touchdown on the south side of Earth’s only natural satellite. Billions of people across India and globally closely monitoring the much-awaited event. More so after Russia’s Luna-25 spacecraft crashed on Sunday after spinning out of control. In the run-up to the scheduled soft landing of Chandrayaan-3, people across the country prayed to God in all denominations of places of worship for a successful mission. Special screenings of the soft landing were organized across the country, including schools and science centers, and public institutions. ISRO made the live actions available on the ISRO website, its YouTube channel, Facebook, and public broadcaster DD National TV. The scheduled timing for the soft landing of Chandrayaan-3 on the moon’s south pole on August 23, 2023 (Wednesday), was 18:04 IST, with the powered descent of Vikram lander at 1745 IST. ISRO had been releasing a series of up-close images of the moon, assisting the lander module in determining its position (latitude and longitude) by matching them against an onboard moon reference map. Historically, spacecraft missions to the Moon have primarily targeted the equatorial region due to its favourable terrain and operating conditions. However, the lunar south pole presents a vastly different and more challenging terrain compared to the equatorial region. The spacecraft was launched from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Andhra Pradesh’s Sriharikota on July 14. A GSLV Mark 3 (LVM 3) heavy-lift launch vehicle was used for the launch of the spacecraft that was placed in the lunar orbit on August 5 and since then it was through a series of orbital manoeuvres been lowered closer to the moon’s surface.

Vikram Lander's ILSA comprises a cluster of six high-sensitivity accelerometers, which are indigenously fabricated using the Silicon Micromachining process. The core sensing element consists of a spring-mass system with comb-structured electrodes. External vibrations lead to a deflection of the spring, resulting in a change in capacitance which is converted into voltage. ILSA's primary objective is to measure ground vibrations generated by natural quakes, impacts, and artificial events during the Chandrayaan 3 mission. The vibrations recorded during the rover's navigation on August 25, are depicted in the figure posted by ISRO on social media platform X. Additionally, an event, seemingly natural, recorded on August 26, is also shown. The source of this event is currently under investigation, the Indian space agency said.

The Chandrayaan-3 spacecraft, launched on July 14, flawlessly executed a soft landing at 6:04 PM IST, as cheers of joy erupted across the nation. Over the course of a lunar day – equal to 14 Earth days – the mission will conduct detailed analysis of the moon's surface and search for traces of water. India joined China as the only other country to have operational rovers exploring the lunar landscape. Rohit Sharma during India's 1st ODI vs West Indies; Chandrayaan-3 landing on the Moon surface(AP/PTI) As India successfully landed on the moon, the social media platforms were full of congratulatory wishes towards ISRO and Indian Premier League (IPL) franchise Mumbai Indians posted a rather interesting picture to mark the occasion on their X (formerly Twitter) account. MI made a reference to the Chandrayaan-2 mission in 2019, that had failed in its landing on the lunar surface to draw a unique cricketing parallel. Incidentally, Team India had also failed marginally short of making into the final of the 2019 World Cup, losing to New Zealand in the semis. Drawing the parallels, MI indicated that ISRO made a successful comeback with Chandrayaan-3 and now, it's Team India's returns to make a similar return in the 2023 World Cup. Team India – then under the captaincy of Virat Kohli – enjoyed a brilliant run as it topped the group stage, but fell short by 21 runs in the semi-final in Manchester. In late 2021, Rohit Sharma took over the reins of captaincy in the ODIs and the 2023 World Cup marks his maiden ICC tournament as captain in the format. India's ICC trophy drought, however, dates back to 2013 when the side lifted the Champions Trophy under MS Dhoni's leadership. With Rohit at helm, India faced defeats in the semi-final of the T20 World Cup last year (against England), and the title clash at the World Test Championship in June 2023 (against Australia). With the home World Cup coming up in October-November later this year, India are among the favourites to lift the title. The ODI squad was boosted by the returns of batters KL Rahul and Shreyas Iyer earlier this week; both were included in the Asia Cup squad.

1773,"Chandrayaan 3: After Pragyan Rover, ISRO sets Vikram Lander into ‘sleep mode’","The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) shared an update regarding Chandrayaan-3's Vikram Lander on Monday and said it had been set into sleep mode around 08:00 am in the morning. ISRO hsares images of Vikram Lander from Moon's surface.(ISRO) “Vikram Lander is set into sleep mode around 08:00 Hrs. IST today. Prior to that, in-situ experiments by ChaSTE, RAMBHA-LP and ILSA payloads are performed at the new location. The data collected is received at the Earth,” it said. The space agency further informed that the lander's payloads have been deactivated, while its receivers remain operational. “Vikram will fall asleep next to Pragyan once the solar power is depleted and the battery is drained. Hoping for their awakening, around September 22, 2023,” it said, sharing images from before and after the hop. The Vikram Lander had earlier successfully attempted a soft landing for the second time today. ISRO has already activated the sleep mode of Pragyan Rover. The battery is fully charged, the receiver is kept on and the solar panel is oriented to receive the light at the next sunrise expected on September 22. Throughout its operational phase, Vikram Lander and Pragyan rover executed numerous lunar experiments: 1. Rover Exploration: Prior to activating the Pragyan rover's sleep mode, ISRO reported that it covered a distance of over 100 meters. Notably, the rover's communication range is limited to 500 meters from the Vikram lander. 2. Historic Sulphur Discovery: The Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscope (LIBS) instrument onboard the rover unequivocally confirmed the presence of Sulphur (S) in the lunar surface near the south pole, representing a groundbreaking in-situ measurement. Additionally, LIBS detected Al, Ca, Fe, Cr, Ti, Mn, Si, and O. 3. Pioneering Plasma Measurements: The Radio Anatomy of Moon Bound Hypersensitive Ionosphere and Atmosphere - Langmuir Probe (RAMBHA-LP) payload onboard Chandrayaan-3 Lander conducted groundbreaking measurements of the near-surface lunar plasma environment over the south polar region. Preliminary assessments suggest relatively sparse plasma near the lunar surface. These quantitative measurements hold promise for mitigating interference in radio wave communication and enhancing future lunar mission designs. 4. Seismic Activity Recording: The Instrument for the Lunar Seismic Activity (ILSA) payload on Chandrayaan 3 Lander, the first Micro Electro Mechanical Systems (MEMS) technology-based instrument on the moon, recorded the movements of the rover and other payloads. Additionally, it captured an event on August 26, deemed to be of natural origin, which is currently under investigation. 5. Thermal Behaviour Exploration: The ChaSTE (Chandra's Surface Thermophysical Experiment) instrument measured the temperature profile of the lunar topsoil around the pole to better understand the thermal characteristics of the moon's surface. Equipped with a controlled penetration mechanism capable of reaching a depth of 10 cm beneath the surface and featuring 10 individual temperature sensors, the probe generated a temperature variation graph for the lunar surface/near-surface at various depths during its penetration. This marked the first such profile for the lunar south pole, with ongoing detailed observations. 6. Alternate Sulphur Confirmation: Another instrument onboard the rover corroborated the presence of Sulphur (S) in the region using a distinct technique.

1787,Moonshot moment: India’s stakes claim as space power,"Chandryaan-3, the successor to India’s ongoing series of lunar missions, Chandrayaan-1 and 2, is set to launch on July 14, with the target of making India only the fourth nation in the world to successfully land its spacecraft on the surface of the moon. PREMIUM The Launch Vehicle Mark-III (LVM3) M4 vehicle with Chandrayaan-3 at the launch pad at Satish Dhawan Space Centre(PTI) Also read: ISRO's Chandrayaan-3 launch today: Live stream and timeline details Isro chairman S Somanath, in an interview with HT earlier this week, said that his organisation is fully prepared for the launch and has taken its lessons from the shortcomings of Chandrayaan-2 – it launched on July 22, 2019, and made what Isro described as a “hard landing” on September 6 – to go forward with a so-called “failure-based” design for Chandrayaan-3. “We are prepared for the launch. Since Chandrayaan-2, we have rectified the errors, and have improved the spacecraft to be more flexible to possible problems,” Somanath said. The success of Chandrayaan-3 is critical not just from the scientific perspective but also because it forms the backbone of the country’s aspiration of being at the forefront of global space and scientific developments in the near future. Leading up to the launch, HT takes a look at why the third lunar mission is significant for furthering India’s space ambitions, and how this will pave way for future international collaborations. What the mission entails Chandrayaan-3 aims to pick up from where Chandrayaan-2 left off. With the mission, Isro aims to demonstrate its end-to-end capability in safe landing and roving on the surface of the moon. It has three objectives — to demonstrate safe and soft landing on the moon surface (which could not be achieved with Chandrayaan-2), to demonstrate rover abilities on the moon surface, and to conduct in-situ scientific experiments. Chandrayaan-3 will launch on-board the Launch Vehicle Mark-3 (LVM-3) rocket, previously known as Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV) Mk-III – a 640-tonne behemoth that has now achieved back-to-back success in six mission launches. The launch will take place from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre, Sriharikota, at 2.35pm on July 14. The 43.5m-tall rocket will carry on it and deploy into space the two modules that form Chandrayaan-3 – a propulsion module, and a lander module. The propulsion module is designed to ferry the lander module, which will also contain the lunar rover within it, to a 100km lunar orbit. The propulsion module contains a single experimental payload – Spectro-polarimetry of Habitable Planet Earth, or SHAPE – that will study the spectro-polarimetric signatures (the polarisation of light emitted by celestial objects) of Earth in the near-infrared wavelength for 3-6 months as it orbits the moon, according to Isro. The 1,724-kg lander, which is equipped to “soft land” at a specified lunar site, contains three payloads that will have a mission life of a lunar day (or 14 Earth days) – one each to measure surface plasma density, thermal levels, and seismic activity. A 26-kg rover will roll out of the lander on the lunar surface and will drive around and carry out in-situ chemical analysis of the lunar surface during in the single lunar day it will be active. Isro chief, Somanath said that Chandrayaan-3 is expected to start lunar orbit nearly a month after its launch, and its lander and rover are expected to land on the moon on August 23. The landing site is near the south pole (around 300km from the lunar south pole) at 70° latitude. If all goes to plan, India will become thefirst country in the world to soft-land near the lunar south pole. Before this, all other lunar missions have only managed to make a landing in the equatorial region of the moon — a few degrees north or south of the equator. Nasa’s Surveyor-7, which landed near 40° South latitude in 1968, is the furthest that any spacecraft has landed from the equator. So, what lessons were learnt from Chandrayaan-2? A senior Isro scientist involved in the Chandryaan-3 mission explained that Chandrayaan-2 went well till the final phase of its intended mission plan, but it could not make a soft landing. Soft landings, when a craft touches down at a safe, slow and controlled speed, are particularly critical on crewed missions or missions in which the spacecraft is expected perform scientific experiments and tests after landing. The Chandrayaan-2 orbiter, however, is currently functional and continues to provide critical data to Isro. Also read: Where Chandrayaan-3 lies in the historical context of lunar exploration “We landed with a higher velocity – we call this a crash landing. But if you analyse the mission in its entirety, we have perfected the part of reaching up to the moon. We did it during Chandrayaan-1, Chandrayaan-2 and also during the Mars orbiter mission,” the official explained. The analysis report prepared by Isro after Chandrayaan-2 highlighted that the five engines that were used for the reduction of velocity, developed a higher entry thrust than was intended. The intention was for the lander to lose most of its velocity by the time it was around 400m from the lunar surface and start the process of hovering above the intended landing site to ensure a soft vertical descent. The extra speed, however, caused it to crash on the moon’s surface, Somanath explained in the interview. Another roadblock that Chandryaan-2 came across was that the landing spot was limited to 500m by 500m, which did not provide enough flexibility for the craft to overcome possible errors and still ensure safe landing. This time the marked landing area has been increased to 4km by 2.5 km. A major change from Chandrayaan-2, is that Chandrayaan-3 will focus on a major orbiter this time, since the scientific objective for the orbiter was already achieved in the second mission. Isro has also increased the fuel capacity so that it can move to an alternative landing site, in case of an unforeseen problem during landing. Ajey Lele, consultant at Manohar Parrikar Institute for defence studies and analyses, said that learnings from Chandrayaan-2 have led to many improvements, which appears to go in Isro’s favour this time. “During Chandrayaan-2, we could not manage a soft landing as intended. But the learnings from this mission have helped improve the science and technology aspects of Chandrayaan-3, which is extremely important,” Lele said. Competing missions around the world While India is racing to become the fourth country to land on the moon – the United States, the former Soviet Union and China have already achieved it – there are other countries also in the fray with ambitious lunar missions lined up in the weeks following Chandrayaan-3. After much delay, Russia’s space agency Roscosmos announced earlier this year that it will be launching its robotic Luna 25 lander on July 13. However, the mission is still coping with delays, and is now scheduled to launch in August. Luna 25 will be Russia’s first lunar expedition since the fall of the Soviet Union, the last mission being the Luna 24 lunar sample return in 1976. The mission was earlier scheduled for 2021, but has missed deadlines repeatedly. The spacecraft, which is due to fly on-board a Soyuz-2.1b, will also target the lunar south polar region, where it will operate for at least a year. Meanwhile, Japan’s space agency — the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) — earlier this week announced the launch date for its X-Ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission (XRISM) and the Smart Lander for Investigating Moon (SLIM) mission, for August 26. XRISM mission, in association with Nasa and the European Space Agency, is a replacement for Japan’s Hitomi X-ray astronomy satellite, which failed a month after its launch in February 2016. SLIM hopes to make Japan join the elite club of lunar landing nations, and will perform a precision landing on the lunar surface.",Chandrayaan-3,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chandrayaan3-set-to-launch-on-july-14-india-aims-to-become-fourth-nation-to-land-on-moon-101689275955666.html,Hindustan Times,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""tonality"", ""reason"": ""The article uses celebratory language ('Moonshot moment', 'India’s stakes claim as space power') and emphasizes India's achievements, suggesting a nationalistic tone."", ""confidence"": 0.8}"
1817,"Meet Chandrayaan-3's Russian competitor. Launch on Friday, but could reach Moon sooner","The Russian space agency, Roscosmos, is all set to launch its moon mission Luna 25 for the lunar south pole in the early hours of Friday, reviving Soviet Union-era lunar exploration. ISRO's Chandrayaan-3 took off for Moon on July 14. Roscosmos' Luna 25 is scheduled to launch on Friday. This comes just four weeks after India launched its own lunar lander, Chandrayaan-3, which is scheduled to make a soft touch down at the Moon's south pole on August 23. Roscosmos stated that its Luna 25 spacecraft will take about five days to travel to the Moon. It will then spend around five to seven days in lunar orbit before descending to one of three potential landing sites near the pole, reported Reuters. This timeline indicates that Russia's mission could reach the lunar surface around the same time as or shortly before the Indian mission. Roscosmos, however, assured that the two missions won't interfere with each other, as they have separate landing areas planned. The Russian Space Agency stated, “There is no danger that they interfere with each other or collide. There is enough space for everyone on the moon,” Reuters added. The Luna 25 mission aims to study the composition of the lunar polar regolith (surface material) and the plasma and dust components of the lunar polar exosphere, according to the United States space agency National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Chandrayaan-3 aims to demonstrate a safe and soft landing on the lunar surface, rover mobility, and in-situ scientific experiments, said Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). Luna 25's lander features a four-legged base housing landing rockets and propellant tanks. An upper compartment contains solar panels, communication equipment, onboard computers, and scientific instruments. Chandrayaan-3 consists of an indigenous lander module (LM), a propulsion module (PM), and a rover. The rover is equipped with scientific payloads for chemical analysis of the lunar surface. READ IN DETAIL - Chandrayaan 3 inches closer to moon: What is the role of Vikram lander, Pragyan rover? Luna 25 carries eight science instruments, including gamma-ray and neutron spectrometers, infrared spectrometers, mass spectrometers, and imaging systems. The Chandrayaan-3 lander carries payloads like Chandra’s Surface Thermophysical Experiment (ChaSTE) and Langmuir Probe (LP), while the rover carries instruments like Alpha Particle X-ray Spectrometer (APXS) and Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscope (LIBS). The primary landing site for Luna 25 is near the lunar south pole, with a reserve site located southwest of the Manzini crater. Chandrayaan-3's landing site is located at specific lunar coordinates in the southern region, with dimensions of 4 km x 2.4 km. Luna 25's lander is expected to operate on the lunar surface, studying regolith and exospheric dust and particles, for approximately one year. The mission life of Chandrayaan-3's lander and rover is approximately one lunar day (around 14 Earth days). Luna-25 will launch using a Soyuz-2 Fregat booster. The chosen launch vehicle for Chandrayaan-3 was the Launch Vehicle Mark-III M4 rocket. Although the south pole of the Moon has challenging terrain for landing, it is a highly valued target because scientists believe it could contain substantial amounts of ice, potentially useful for extracting fuel, oxygen, and even drinking water.",Chandrayaan-3,https://www.hindustantimes.com/technology/meet-chandrayaan-3s-russian-competitor-luna-25-could-reach-moon-sooner-101691478510539.html,Hindustan Times,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""tonality"", ""reason"": ""The article uses subtly positive language when describing Chandrayaan-3's goals and features, while Luna 25's description is more neutral."", ""confidence"": 0.7}"

Prime Minister Narendra Modi (ANI/PIB) During his visit, PM Modi is expected to address the team of scientists involved in the ambitious unmanned lunar mission and discuss ISRO's future endeavours. Traffic advisory for roads leading to the ISRO facility has already been released. Restrictions imposed on north Bengaluru roads leading to the facility, whereas, on east and central Bengaluru roads leading to HAL airport between 6:30 am and 9:30 am. After an eventful 40-day journey, the lander module made a successful soft landing on the lunar surface on August 23 as scheduled, making India the fourth nation to achieve such feat and the first to touch down on the uncharted south pole of the moon. PM Modi joined from South Africa's Johannesburg, where he was attending the BRICS summit, during the Vikram lander's touch down. During his virtual address, he said, ""When we see such historic moments it makes us very proud. This is the dawn of new India."" Launched on July 14 from Andhra Pradesh's Sriharikota by Launch Vehicle Mark-3 (LVM3) missile, the success of Chandrayaan-3 mission's historic milestone marks another breakthrough in ISRO's space endeavours. It carried a propulsion and a lander module. The lander module had a configuration of a lander – Vikram – and a rover – Pragyan. Following the soft landing, the rover payload will carry out on the ground chemical analysis of the lunar surface. Both the rover and lander payloads have the capacity to carry out experiments there. On Wednesday, the Pragyan rover descended from the Vikram lander and undertook its first moonwalk. Utilising a two-segment ramp, the rover safely rolled down onto the lunar surface. Equipped with a solar panel for power generation, the rover's activities were documented through multiple videos shared by ISRO later. After the touchdown, the mission will be carried out for one lunar day – equivalent to approximately 14 Earth days. Chandrayaan-3 is a follow-on mission after the Indian space agency's second lunar mission in an attempt to demonstrate end-to-end safe-landing and roving capability on lunar surface.

1871,"Siddaramaiah Stands Firm, No State Holiday for Ram Mandir Consecration","Bengaluru: In the face of mounting pressure from Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Janata Dal (Secular) leaders demanding declaration of a public holiday in Karnataka on Monday, chief minister Siddaramaiah reaffirmed the government’s decision not to grant leave for government offices and schools on the day of the consecration of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya. Ruling out a public holiday in Karnataka for Ram Temple inauguration in Ayodhya, chief minister Siddaramaiah said the muzrai department will conduct special rituals at all state-run temples during the consecration event. (PTI) Siddaramaiah, addressing the media in Tumakuru, clarified that his government would not declare a statewide holiday. “Tomorrow (Monday), I am inaugurating a new Ram temple constructed in Mahadevapura constituency in Bengaluru,” the chief minister said. He added that the muzrai department will conduct special rituals at all state-run temples during the Ram Temple consecration event in Ayodhya. When asked again about the demand for a holiday, he reiterated, “Won’t announce any holiday.” Earlier in the day, Leader of Opposition R Ashok formally requested the chief minister to announce a holiday on Monday. JD(S) leader H D Kumaraswamy shared a similar sentiment, advocating for a public holiday to honour the consecration of the Ram Temple. “Seven crore Kannadigas are demanding leave. Even AAP has announced a half-day holiday in Delhi, so why has Siddaramaiah not announced?... Everywhere in Karnataka, the police are threatening the ‘karsevaks’. I will write a letter to the CM demanding leave for seven crore Kannadigas to celebrate Rama,” Ashok said. BJP state president B Y Vijayendra and Bangalore South MP Tejasvi Surya continued to advocate for a holiday on January 22. Vijayendra pointed out that the Union government had already declared a half-day for its offices on that day, emphasising the significance of the event for millions of Hindus. “The Union government has already declared January 22 as a half-day for its offices. Crores of Hindus are looking forward to the event. Many of them may want to visit a nearby temple or watch the proceedings at home. For their convenience, a holiday must be declared,” Vijayendra said. Surya said 14 Indian states have already declared January 22 as a holiday. “Kannadigas have a significant role in the Ram Temple right from construction to the sculptor of the idol. Karnataka is the land of Hanuman. When the entire state is celebrating, the government doesn’t want to declare a holiday,” Surya said, adding that hundreds of schools had approached his office seeking a holiday. “This government is behaving like it is anti-Rama. The CM is behaving like a hater of Rama,” Surya added. The muzrai department had earlier directed over 33,000 state-run temples in the state to offer special prayers on January 22. Deputy chief minister DK Shivakumar said there is a need for separation of politics from religious matters. “Even before others could tell us, the muzrai department has directed for special pujas in muzrai temples. Whatever rituals and pujas have to be conducted in temples, they will be done,” he said. “There is Ram in chief minister Siddaramaiah’s name and Shiva in my name. There is no need for others to preach to us or bring pressure on us. We will execute our responsibility. There should be religion in politics, but politics should not be there in religion,” he added.",Ayodhya Ram Mandir,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/siddaramaiah-stands-firm-no-state-holiday-for-ram-mandir-consecration-101705865716603.html,Hindustan Times,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""tonality"", ""reason"": ""The article uses loaded language like 'hater of Rama' and portrays BJP leaders as advocating for a holiday while Siddaramaiah is portrayed as resisting it."", ""confidence"": 0.8}"

1974,"Will Ayodhya Ram Mandir help realise PM Modi, BJP's 400 Lok Sabha seats dream?","Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday inaugurated the much-awaited grand Ram temple in Ayodhya, in a political triumph for the Bharatiya Janata Party's most popular leader, who is seeking re-election in the 2024 Lok Sabha polls. Prime Minister Narendra Modi being felicitated by Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath in the presence of RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat during the 'Pran Pratishtha' ceremony of the Ram Janmabhoomi Temple in Ayodhya on Monday. (ANI) The Ram temple fulfilled a long-standing demand by millions of Hindus who worship the revered deity and extoll him for the virtues of truth, sacrifice and ethical governance. The BJP, which seized on the demand, has portrayed the Ram temple as central to its vision of reclaiming Hindu pride, which it says was suppressed by centuries of Mughal rule and British colonialism. Modi and his ruling BJP hope that opening the Ayodhya Ram temple in India's most populated state Uttar Pradesh, which has 80 Lok Sabha seats, will help catapult the prime minister to a record third successive term in elections expected this spring. But with the temple still under construction, critics accuse Modi of a hurried opening to woo voters. Modi, dressed in a traditional kurta tunic, led the opening ceremony as Hindu priests chanted hymns inside the temple’s inner sanctum. A conch was blown by a priest to mark the temple’s opening and Modi placed a lotus flower in front of the black stone Ram Lalla idol, decked in intricate gold ornaments and holding a golden bow and arrow. Modi later prostrated before the idol. Nearly 7,500 people, including elite industrialists, politicians and movie stars, witnessed the ritual on a giant screen outside the temple as an Indian Air Force helicopter showered flower petals. The Centre turned the event into a national occasion by organising live screenings across the country and closing offices for half a day. Saffron flags adorned the streets of various cities where BJP workers and followers had gone door to door handing out religious pamphlets. Modi has been the face of an unprecedented fusion of religion and politics in the country. Ahead of the temple opening, he set the tone by visiting numerous Ram temples over 11 days as part of a Hindu ritual. If media reports are to be believed, the BJP is looking at all avenues, including bringing in leaders from other parties, to achieve the mammoth target of winning 400 of the 543 Lok Sabha seats in the upcoming elections. At an important meeting recently, BJP national president JP Nadda assigned different responsibilities to various general secretaries of the party. ""This committee will explore the possibility of bringing influential leaders and sitting MPs from other parties to the BJP. The decision will be taken based on the person's influence in the constituency and his or her ability to win elections,"" NDTV reported citing a source. Political analysts and critics see Monday’s ceremony as the beginning of the election campaign for Modi. According to them, the pomp-filled display led by the government shows the extent to which the line between religion and state has eroded under Modi, news agency AP reported. “Prime ministers prior to Modi have also been to temples, been to other places of worship, but they went there as devotees. This is the first time that he went there as somebody who performed the ritual,” said Nilanjan Mukhopadhyay, an expert and author of a book on Modi, told the news agency. The grand Ram temple in Ayodhya is expected to embolden Modi’s chances of returning to power by drawing on the religious sentiments of Hindus, who make up 80% of India’s population. The run-up to the consecration ceremony, which takes place just months before the Lok Sabha elections, was marked by sparring between the ruling BJP and the Opposition.

A year later, then BJP president Lal Krishna Advani embarked on a rath yatra from Somnath in Gujarat to build the temple in Ayodhya. His yatra was cut short after Advani was arrested in Bihar on the orders of then Lalu Prasad government.

Workers bring the idol of Ram Lalla at the ‘Garbhagriha’ of Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Temple, ahead of the temple’s consecration ceremony, in Ayodhya, Wednesday. (PTI Photo) The 51-inch idol was brought on an open truck from Vivek Srishti Trust, an International Yoga and Meditation Institute, where it was carved by renowned sculptor Arun Yogiraj of Karnataka, to the sanctum sanctorum of the Ram Temple amid chants of “Jai Shri Ram” by devotees. The idol was covered throughout the 10-km journey. Before reaching the temple site, the vehicle also stopped at the historic Hanuman Garhi temple (Lord Hanuman is considered the protector of Ayodhya). Seven women performed ‘kalash pujan’ on the bank of the Saryu, collecting water from the river in copper pitchers and taking them to the Ram Mandir. Anil Mishra, member of the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust and the jajman (host) of the seven-day long rituals, joined the women in the ritual. This water will be used to bathe the deity. A second silver idol of Ram Lalla was taken around the temple campus for ‘parisar bhraman’.This small idol, placed in a flower palanquin, was created as a substitute for the new idol to perform Vedic rituals and was carried by temple priests. “As the new idol weighs 150kg, it will not be feasible to relocate/shift it several times during the ‘pran pratishtha’ ceremony. So, as a substitute, a small silver idol has been prepared. If required during the ceremony, this silver idol will be shifted to perform vedic rituals,” said office bearers of the Trust. This smaller idol will also be seated in the sanctum-sanctorum of the Ram Temple.

2013,"Ram Temple inauguration: Advent of a new era, says PM Modi","Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday said the consecration of the idol of Ram Lalla in Ayodhya marks the advent of a new era and gave a call to people to go beyond the shrine’s construction to build the foundation of a strong, grand and divine India of the next 1,000 years. Prime Minister Narendra Modi arrives at the Ram Mandir for the 'Pran Pratishtha' ceremony, in Ayodhya, Monday. (PTI) Describing the inauguration of Ram temple, coming after a long wait, as not only a moment of celebration but also realisation of the maturity of Indian society, he said the temple is a symbol of national consciousness and the ceremony to unveil the idol of Ram Lalla is also the ‘Pran Pratishtha’ of human values and highest ideals. The Ram temple would be witness to the India’s rise as a developed nation and the country would reach the top, he said. Addressing the gathering after Pran Pratishtha, Modi said, “Ram is the faith of India, Ram is the foundation of India, Ram is the idea of India, Ram is the law of India. Ram is the prestige of India, Ram is the glory of India...Ram is the leader and Ram is the policy. Ram is eternal. When Ram is honoured, its effect does not last for years or centuries, its effect is for thousands of years,” he said. “For us, this is not only an occasion of victory but also of humility,” he said, adding that the occasion symbolised the arrival of Lord Ram and this would make the future for people brighter than the past. “What next? This is the question now after the consecration ceremony,” he said. He said he was feeling that this cycle of time is changing and this generation has been chosen to witness the same. “We have to lay foundation of India for next 1000 years now,” he said. He also said people used to say the construction of Ram temple would set the nation on fire. Instead of creating any negativity, the Ram temple was leading to positive energy, he said. “Ram is not about any dispute. Ram is a solution to all the problems,” he said. The Prime Minister said that the sunrise of January 22 has brought a wonderful glow. “January 22, 2024, is not a date written on the calendar. It is the origin of a new time cycle,” he said. He referred to the legal dispute over Ram Janambhoomi in Ayodhya which lasted decades and expressed his gratitude to the judiciary “for doing justice” . “The temple of Lord Ram, synonymous with justice, was also built in a just manner...Ram Lalla will not stay in a tent now. He will stay in the grand temple,” he said. “Today the land of Ayodhya is asking some questions to all of us, to every Ram devotee, to every Indian. The grand temple of Shri Ram has been built, now what next? The wait of centuries is over, what next? On this occasion of today, will we bid farewell to the gods and divine spirits who have come to bless us and are watching us? No, not at all. Today I feel with a pure heart that the cycle of time is changing,” he said. “It is a happy coincidence that our generation has been chosen as the architect of a timeless path. The generation after a thousand years will remember our efforts of nation-building today.That’s why I say - this is the time, this is the right time. From today, from this sacred time, we have to lay the foundation of India for the next thousand years,” he added. The Prime Minister said devotees of Lord Ram are completely absorbed in this historic moment. “The devotees of Prabhu Ram, in every corner of the country and the world, are deeply feeling this. Today our Ram has come...After waiting for centuries our Ram has arrived. After centuries of unprecedented patience, countless sacrifices, sacrifices and penance, our Lord Ram has arrived,” he said. “This moment is divine, this moment is the holiest of all! After the Bhoomi Pujan of Ram Temple, enthusiasm and excitement were increasing every day in the entire country,” he added. The PM also said that Lord Ram is connected to the soul of India. “Lord Ram resides in the hearts of Indians. Today, Ayodhya has not only witnessed the Pran Pratishtha of the sacred idol of Prabhu Shri Ram, but also the ‘Pran Pratishtha’ of the unwavering faith in Indian culture manifested in the form of Prabhu Shri Ram. Today, what has happened in Ayodhya is also the ‘Pran Pratishtha’ of human values and the ‘Pran Pratishtha’ of the highest ideals!” he said. PM Modi also sought forgiveness from Lord Ram for the delay in the construction of the temple. “Today, I apologise to Lord Ram as something was lacking in our love and penance due to which this work (construction of Ram Temple) was not done for so many years. However, that gap has been bridged today and I am confident that Lord Ram will forgive us,” PM Modi said. The exile of Lord Ram was for 14 years earlier and so the disconnect with the people was for a shorter period than now but people have faced a disconnect of centuries this time, he said. Referring to the celebratory mood among the people, he said kirtans were being organised in villages and cleanliness drives were being launched. Modi used the occasion to pay respect to Lord Hanuman and the Hanuman Garhi, mother Janki, Laxman, Bharat and Shatrughan, holy Ayodhya and Saryu. “I am having divine experiences at this moment. I also bow with gratitude to these divine powers that are present around us,” he said. He also referred to his visit Arichal Munai, the starting point of Ram Setu. He said during his 11-day ritual ahead of the consecration ceremony, he visited all the places where Lord Ram had set foot and said there was a similar festive spirit in the name of Ram from the sea to the Saryu. “Lord Ram is connected to the soul of India. Ram resides in the hearts of Indians,” he added. He recalled his experience of listening to Ram Katha in many languages and said Ram is there in the memories and festivals of many traditions. “In every age, people have lived Ram. They have expressed Ram in their style and words. This ‘Ram Ras’ is continuously flowing like the flow of life. Ram Katha is infinite and Ramayan too is endless. Ideals, values and teachings of Ram are the same everywhere,” he said. He said the whole world is connected with the Pran Pratistha and this reflected the omnipresence of Ram. He also referred to the spirit behind Mata Shabri’s trust that ‘Ram will come’ in every Indian’s heart will be the basis of grand capable and divine India. He referred to the depth and originality of Ram’s affection for Nishadraj and said it was pure. He also mentioned Jatayu’s integrity, who knew about his imminent defeat when he fought Ravan, the ruler of Lanka who possessed extreme knowledge and immense power. Drawing a link between Ram and Rashtra (nation), he said, “With Ram’s work, rashtra’s (nation’s) work, every moment of time, every particle of the body will connect the dedication of Ram with the goal of dedication to the nation.” Modi exhorted the youngsters to take the support of their strong heritage and move ahead with confidence. “India will reach the goal of prosperity by following the path of both the purity of tradition and the infinity of modernity,” he said.",Ayodhya Ram Mandir,https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/advent-of-a-new-era-says-pm-101705947809336.html,Hindustan Times,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""tonality"", ""reason"": ""The article uses overwhelmingly positive and celebratory language when describing the Ram Temple inauguration and PM Modi's role."", ""confidence"": 0.9}"

The Ram temple in Ayodhya is likely to open for devotees on January 24 after the consecration of Ram Lalla idol.(HT File) In an interview to PTI, he also said Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to take part in an event related to the 'pran pratishtha' on any day during January 20-24. The final date is yet to be communicated by the Prime Minister's Office, he said. Mishra also said work is underway to design an apparatus that will be installed on the 'shikhar' of the temple, which will make sun rays fall momentarily on the forehead of the deity in the sanctum sanctorum on the day of Ram Navami every year. It is being built in Bengaluru and its design is being overseen by scientists, he added.

The Supreme Court in a 2019 verdict had paved the way for the construction of a Ram temple by a trust at the disputed site in Ayodhya, and directed the Centre to allot an alternative five-acre plot to the Sunni Waqf Board for building a new mosque at a ""prominent"" place in the holy town of Uttar Pradesh. The court had ruled that the 2.77 acres of the disputed land where the demolished 16th century-era Babri Masjid once stood will remain with a Central government receiver and be handed over to the trust within three months of the ruling for the construction of the temple. The Sri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust will formally invite Prime Minister Modi for the consecration ceremony during which the idol of Ram Lalla will be installed in the sanctum sanctorum of the temple.

The Ram temple in Ayodhya is likely to open for devotees on January 24 after the consecration of Ram Lalla idol, Mishra, a member of the trust, had said in June. In response to a query during the interview, Mishra did not reject the suggestion that the ceremony taking place ahead of the 2024 Lok Sabha polls shall have political implications. ""It was planned to complete the construction of the ground floor of the temple by December 2023 and this work will definitely be completed within the stipulated time,"" he said. He said the temple is being constructed with a vision that its structure will last at least 1,000 years The 'pran pratishtha' will be started in consultation with knowledgable saints and sages, Mishra added. He said a committee under the trust's general secretary Champat Rai has been set up which is working the details of this planned ceremony. ""When the ceremony takes place on January 22 next year, then there is a huge rush expected. The trust has urged people to see it from their homes, villages (via television broadcast),"" the chairman of the temple's construction committee said. The Prime Minister's Office is yet to inform as to on what date he will attend the 'pran pratistha'-related ceremony, Mishra said, adding the trust will announce it when the final programme comes. But it is expected to be during January 20-24 as after that the PM will be very busy with Republic Day and other programmes, Mishra said. When asked about the plan for devotees who will come after the consecration ceremony, he said, they will get 15-20 seconds time to for a 'darshan', but they will be satisfied with the overall experience at the temple complex. On the temple architecture and construction material, Mishra said, iron has not been used in its construction, and copper has been used to link stone blocks. The built-up area of the temple is 2.5 acres and if one includes the 'parikrama path' the total area of the complex is about eight acres, he said. Ninety bronze panels will depict the life and duties performed by Lord Ram, he added. He also said about ?900 crore has been spent so far on the temple's construction, and it is estimated that about ?1,700 crore to 1,800 crore will be spent on the overall construction of the complex. Mishra said some artefacts were unearthed during excavations by the Archeological Survey of India (ASI) and some objects were found during the temple's groundbreaking and construction work. Some of these items have been placed safely under the custody of the trust, Mishra said. ""After taking permission from the ASI, we will display these in a proposed museum.""

The apex court has also asked that the state to maintain a data of the applications received and decisions taken. Meanwhile, Tamil Nadu government told the court that there is no ban on holding screenings of the ceremony or holdings special poojas or bhajans on the occasion. The decision comes after Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Monday moved the Supreme Court as an urgent matter for hearing against the DMK-led Tamil Nadu government's alleged order banning the live telecast of Lord Ram Lalla's 'pran-pratishtha' (consecration ceremony) in the Ram Janmabhoomi Temple in Ayodhya on Monday, at temples and other public places.

""It is respectfully submitted that State Government run by DMK political party has banned live telecast of the auspicious occasion of 'Pran Pratishtha' of Lord Ram at Ayodhya in all the temples across the state of Tamil Nadu,"" the plea said as per the news agency. ""The government has also banned all kinds of poojas, Archana and Annadanam (poor feeding) bhajans on this auspicious occasion.

The three-day events will continue till January 13. “Common people could not attend the pran pratishtha ceremony of Ram Lalla (on January 22, 2024).

2050,Ram temple to be open for devotees from January 23,"The Ram temple would be open for devotees from January 23, a day after the inauguration. The entry of all the devotees would be streamlined and regulated to guard against overcrowding, Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust general secretary Champat Rai said on Monday. The Ram temple in Ayodhya. (FILE PHOTO) The entry to the temple could also be allowed till night to accommodate maximum devotees, Rai said. While the temple would be open for devotees from January 23, the entry of cadres of Vishva Hindu Parishad, RSS and other members of the ‘vichar pariwar (like-minded organisations)’ would start from January 26. “All the cadres would be allotted specific time and batches and would adhere to the schedule decided for them. We expect the numbers to be anywhere between 4500 and 5000 per day and all of them would be requested to leave after a day,” Rai said. This plan would be in place till February 23 or 24, Rai said. “Those who will be invited will be put up at Karsevakpuram, the naturopathy centre at Maniramdas Chavni Kendra and adjacent to Mani Parivat, the place we have named Teerth Kshetra Puram. Arrangements would also be made in ashrams, dharamshalas, home stays and hotels too,” Rai said. “We are trying to ensure best of facilities for guests,” he said. GLOBAL PRESENCE “There is a group from US, another one from Hong Kong. In all 50 nations would be represented at the inauguration. We have decided on one nation, one organisation representative. So, in all 53 representatives from 50 nations, including those from South Africa and Gulf countries, are expected at the event,” Rai said. “The emphasis would be on ensuring that those who have arrived for darshan are able to leave that day itself. The effort is on ensuring people are not put to any inconvenience in this cold. So as per requirement we would ensure darshan timings are extended till night as well,” Rai said. MEDIA COULD BE ALLOWED ENTRY ON JANUARY 22 “We are mulling allowing entry inside the temple to the media too on January 22 afterwards. But as of now, this is not certain, we are thinking on this. This move would go through, subject to an assessment about the impact of this move,” he said. “All must factor in the problems that accompany the construction (of such magnitude),” he said. NO PARALLEL TO STONE STRUCTURE LIKE THIS? “The kind of massive stone structure that has been constructed ... I am no great authority on this but all the same I would like to know if such a massive structure, bigger than this, has been made anywhere before. I would like you to make a comparison and let me know if a stone construction of this magnitude has happened before in 100 or 200 years,” Rai said. BIGGEST POST INDEPENDENCE EVENT “Probably January 22 event is one that might not have ever happened in independent India,” Rai said. “Imagine the best of all fields being invited and all of them present on the same day. This might not have ever happened before and whether it will happen in future, that I can’t predict,” Rai said. CONTROVERSIES The VHP veteran dismissed the controversies swirling the mega religious event or the questions being raised on it, like having the consecration event on an under-construction temple. “Uthane do, mujhe kuchh nahin kehna. Kisi alochna, apatti ka uttar nahin dena, main pranam karta hoon (let the questions or controversies be raised, I have nothing to say on it. I don’t want to answer any criticism or objection.

Their visit came a day before rituals for the January 22 consecration ceremony are scheduled to commence. Congress leaders Avinash Pande, Deepender S Hooda, Ajay Rai along with party leaders and supporters take a holy dip in the Saryu river. (ANI) Senior leaders Deepender Hooda, Supriya Shrinate, Avinash Pande and Ajay Rai took a dip in the Sarya river before visiting the temple. They later talked about briging the proverbial ‘Ram Rajya’ in the country. Last week, the Congress dubbed the consecration ceremony a ""political event"" and claimed the BJP and RSS were attempting to exact political gains from religion. It also turned down the invitation extended to its top leaders -- Sonia Gandhi, Mallikarjun Kharge and Adhir Ranjan Choudhury. It later said its leaders didn't need an invitation to visit the God's abode. Hooda, a towering Congress leader in Haryana, said he comes from a culture where people greet each other with 'ram-ram'. ""I have come here on the occasion of Makar Sankranti to seek blessings of Lord Ram... I came here last year as well... I will not take any political questions on this pious land... We come from a culture where we greet each other with 'ram ram',"" he was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.

I pray that Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra takes inspiration from Lord Ram and delivers justice... Generations of my family have been visiting Ayodhya, and all my future generations will visit too,"" she said.

It is divine and beautiful. The decorated Mandir is worth seeing. It is worth seeing how people are excited to see Lord Ram,"" he added. Satyendra Das said the aarti was held at 6:30am.

2088,Ram Lalla rises: PM Modi inaugurates Ram Temple in Ayodhya,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday threw open a magnificent new Ram Temple in Ayodhya, turning the page on arguably India’s most fractious dispute and fulfilling one of the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) core electoral promises in an event that could have a lasting impact on religion and politics in the country. Priests sit near the Ram Lalla idol in Ayodhya on Monday. (AFP) Modi presided over the ceremony dedicated to the 51-inch black stone idol of the five-year-old god, or Ram Lalla, in front of a thousands-strong crowd comprising India’s most dignitaries from every walk of life. He then spent nearly 40 minutes delivering a rousing speech where he fused faith and governance, transforming the holy moment into a milestone for nation-building and laying a road map for the future course of India. “22nd January 2024 is not a mere date, it’s the origin of a new kal chakra (era)… We have to expand our consciousness from dev to desh, Ram to rashtra – from deity to nation,” he said. Carrying a silver “chattra”,or umbrella, for the deity, Modi cantered up 32 steps to enter the temple around 12.10pm on a crisp chilly day with the winter sun shining down on the 8,000-odd guests comprising top industrialists, sportspersons, politicians, film stars, writers and journalists, and ascetics. He walked through five halls, or “mandaps”,decorated with yellow and saffron marigold flowers, as chants of “Jai Shri Ram” coursed through the crowd like a Mexican Wave. Dressed in a cream kurta paired with a dhoti and patka, he took the pledgefor the consecration ceremony and later offered the first prayers to the deity. “This is a temple of national consciousness in the form of Ram. Lord Ram is India’s faith, foundation, idea, law, consciousness, thinking, prestige and glory,” he said as the crowd broke into applause. Built in the traditional Nagara style of architecture with intricate carvings of deities adorning its white marble walls, the temple spans 380 feet in length and 250 feet in width, with its tallest spire at 161 feet. Supported by 392 columns and accessible through 44 doors, the temple is built on the 2.77 acre plot which Hindus believe to be the birthplace of Lord Ram and which was locked away behind the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid dispute for 150 years, before the Supreme Court’s landmark verdict in 2019. “Our Ram is finally here… he will no longer live in a tent,” Modi said, referring to the makeshift temple where pilgrims offered prayers to the infant deity as rival claims over the main site were litigated in the courts after the 1992 razing of the Babri Masjid. Most opposition parties stayed away from the event, blaming the BJP and Modi of hijacking the event and blurring the line between religion and governance. Read Here | Diyas, firecrackers: India celebrates 'Diwali' after Ram temple inauguration “Siyaram (Sita-Ram) reside in those hearts who honour tradition, ethics and dignity,” Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav posted on X after the consecration event. The opening of the temple is expected to catapult Ayodhya to one of the focal nodes of the Hindu faith, and draw hundreds of thousands of devotees every year. In anticipation of the influx of pilgrims to easily the largest temple to Ram in India, the authorities have spruced up the centuries-old town, pouring in ?30,508 crore to implement a sweeping facelift. It marks an extraordinary triumph for Hindu groups, which have long argued that the site is the birthplace of Lord Ram and see the opening of the temple as a civilisational moment. It is also an important victory for the BJP, which has included the construction of the Ram Temple as one of its core promises in its election manifesto for three decades; the temple will almost certainly figure as one of the party’s top achievements in the narrative for the 2024 general elections. The serene 40-minute ceremony on Monday was in stark contrast to the tension and bloodshed that the plot came to be associated with over the last century, and the thousands who died in the riots that followed the demolition of the Babri Masjid on December 6, 1992. Modi made a reference to the concerns around communal conflagration in his speech, but proceeded to dismiss the speculation as overblown assumptions. “Ram is not fire, he is energy, he is not conflict but solution. Ram does not belong only to us but to all, Ram is not just present but is infinity,” Modi said. Read Here: PM Modi lights 'Ram Jyoti' after Ayodhya Ram Temple 'pran pratishtha' ceremony The ceremony, also attended by one of the original litigants in the title suit, signalled the beginning of a new chapter for Ayodhya and the lives of its residents. “For us the dispute was over the day when the Supreme Court ruled in favour of the temple in 2019. It’s good that the Ram Temple has come up and this will bring additional focus on the temple town and hopefully better fortunes too,” said Ansari, whose father Hashim Ansari was the oldest litigant of the case. Modi performed the final leg of weeklong Vedic rituals by symbolically opening the eyes of the idol with a golden stick, chanting holy verses before placing flower petals at the feet of the deity and joining his palms in prayer. He then prostrated himself before the deity and circled a sacred flame. The 51-inch idol adorned a golden crown, golden ornaments, and a golden bow and arrow. Outside, a military helicopter showered petals on the temple and the audience. Traditional clarinets played devotional music as thousands clad in saffron danced in the streets outside, waving saffron flags and bursting firecrackers. “Jai Shri Ram, ho gaya kaam (hail lord Ram, the work has been accomplished),” Saurabh Shukla, a student of Saket College in Ayodhya shouted joyously and said he would like to be among the first few to visit the grand temple when it opens for all on Tuesday. Ram Temple inauguration: Parents of babies born on propitious day overjoyed Uttar Pradesh governor Anandiben Patel, chief minister Yogi Adityanath and Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh (RSS) chief Mohan Bhagwat were present when the PM reached sanctum sanctorum. Bhagwat was seated next to Modi during the ceremony and performed some rites alongside him. Before the PM’s address, he accepted two spoons full of charnamrit, to break his 11-day fast, from Govind Dev Giri, the treasurer of the Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust, which is overseeing the construction of the temple. Later in the day, he went to Kuber Tila and worshipped Lord Shiva at a restored temple. As evening fell, the shimmering lights from around one million earthen lamps lit up Ayodhya in a golden hue. Across the country, people came out of their homes to light lamps to mark the consecration ceremony, led by PM Modi. “It’s a momentous occasion as dreams of several generations have come true and we hope that the temple will also bring about a change in our fortunes as well,” said Arvind Dubey, who sells construction material near Karsewakpuram, an area purchased by Vishwa Hindu Parishad and named after temple volunteers who were killed in the police firing of 1990.",Ayodhya Ram Mandir,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ram-lalla-rises-in-ayodhya-101705948465590.html,Hindustan Times,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""tonality"", ""reason"": ""The article uses celebratory and reverential language when describing the temple inauguration and Modi's role, suggesting a positive bias."", ""confidence"": 0.8}"

2131,Bharat Biotech vaccine more likely to work against newer strains like UK variant: Vardhan,"With some Congress leaders raising concerns over the grant of approval to Bharat Biotech’s Covid-19 vaccine, health minister Harsh Vardhan asserted on Sunday that Covaxin is more likely to work against newer variants of the virus, including the UK variant, and asked politicians not to “discredit well laid out science-backed protocols” followed for approving the jab.

Responding to them, Vardhan said it is “disgraceful for anyone to politicise such a critical issue.” Tagging Tharoor, Ramesh and Samajwadi Party leader Akhilesh Yavad, the health minister said in a tweet, “...don’t try to discredit well laid out science-backed protocols followed for approving #COVID19vaccines. Wake up & realise you are only discrediting yourselves!” Vardhan said, “COVAXIN is more likely to work against newer variants like N501Y Variant (UK variant) & any other that may arise due to antigenic drift as it contains immunogens (epitopes) from other genes in addition to those from Spike protein.” SP president Yadav said the Covid-19 vaccination programme is a “sensitive process” and the government should not treat it as a “cosmetic” event as it is a matter of lives. Read more| Drug regulator gives final approval for Covid-19 vaccines of SII, Bharat Biotech Covaxin has been indigenously developed by Bharat Biotech in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). ICMR Director General Balram Bhargava also said Covaxin is based on an inactivated whole virus, having potential to target mutated coronavirus strains including the UK variant, which was a major ground for giving it a conditional nod. He, however, said no clear data regarding the efficacy of the vaccine is available so far. The data generated so far demonstrates a strong immune response (both antibody as well as T cell) and in-vitro viral neutralisation. The ongoing clinical trial is the largest trial on 25,800 subjects, in which already 23,000 volunteers have been enrolled including subjects with comorbid conditions, and the vaccine has demonstrated safety till date, Bhargava said. Further allaying apprehensions surrounding the Bharat Biotech vaccine, Vardhan said there were no seroconversions in those who were provided vaccines in Phase II as well as Phase I of Covaxin clinical trials. Seroconversion is the transition from the point of viral infection to when antibodies of the virus become present in the blood. “Our experience with inactivated vaccines not having serious adverse events was also observed in Phase II done among 380 study participants in BBV152 trial in 21280 Person days follow up. No serious adverse events seen. Only 7 per cent persons receiving 6 microgram dose had mild symptoms,” Vardhan said in another tweet. “The data from COVAXIN Phase I & II clinical trials reveals that it not only produces neutralizing antibodies in all participants but also sensitises CD4 T lymphocytes that imparts durable immune response,” Vardhan tweeted. He said vaccines approved globally based on gene encoding spike proteins have protective efficacy of over 90 per cent. “However, COVAXIN based on whole inactivated virus has other antigenic epitopes in addition to spike protein. So,it’s likely to have similar protective efficacy reported for others,” he said. India’s drugs regulator on Sunday approved Oxford Covid-19 vaccine Covishield, manufactured by the Serum Institute, and indigenously developed Covaxin of Bharat Biotech for restricted emergency use in the country, paving the way for a massive inoculation drive.

The recommended gap between two doses is four to six weeks. According to public health officials, the Pune district is scheduled to get 40,000 doses of Covaxin on Wednesday. Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) officials said that there is a shortage in supply of Covaxin which is the only vaccine available for 15-18 age group.

Currently, there is a shortage of Covaxin. We are getting 1,000-1,500 doses per day. The second doses haven’t yet been administered. The second dose can be taken within 28 to 45 days of taking the first dose. Once we get more doses, we can ramp up this drive.” As per data available on the Cowin dashboard, 17,879 beneficiaries in the Pune district and 4,020 in the PMC in the age group of 15 to 18 took their first dose of Covaxin on January 3, the first day of the vaccination drive for this age group. This number rose to 27,662 in Pune district and 4,693 in the PMC limits on January 4, 2022. Till Monday, a total 293,223 doses have been administered to beneficiaries within this age group in the district. According to officials from the public health department, Pune district will get 40,000 Covaxin doses by Wednesday which should ease the situation. “I had a meeting with state officials and 40,000 doses of Covaxin will be administered to Pune district by Wednesday.

At present Assam has around 320,000 doses of Covishield and 20,000 doses of Covaxin. The state will receive around 50,000 doses of Covaxin within the next few days and some more later. (Image used for representation). (BLOOMBERG PHOTO.) “Due to problems with supply of Covaxin, we have decided to stop administering first doses of it in the state for the time being. We have around 150,000 people who got the first dose and are due for their second doses. They will be given their second doses within the 42 days’ time limit,” health minister Keshab Mahanta said. At present Assam has around 320,000 doses of Covishield and 20,000 doses of Covaxin. The state will receive around 50,000 doses of Covaxin within the next few days and some more later. The government also fixed rates of treatment at private hospitals in the state for Covid-19 patients. The rates have been fixed in two categories—for general hospitals and super-specialty hospitals. From now Covid-19 patients staying in general hospitals will have to pay a maximum of ?4,000 daily for stay in general wards, ?5,000 for private wards, ?9,000 daily for ICU without ventilator and ?12,000 for ICU with ventilators. For super-specialty hospitals, the rates would be ?5,000 daily for general wards, ?6500 for private wards, ?10,000 for ICU without ventilator and ?15,000 for ICU with ventilators. The rates would include registration, bed, boarding (food), nursing and consultation charges and tests and medicines but exclude high-end tests, costly medicines like Remdesivir and treatment for co-morbid conditions. “These are the maximum rates which private hospitals can charge per day. To give relief to patients, these hospitals can charge less than the amounts mentioned. The rates were fixed after consultations with private hospitals,” Mahanta said. From now all patients with co-morbidities will have to stay in Covid Care Centres or hospitals. Earlier it was mandatory only for patients above 50 years of age. The government decided to set up paediatric ICUs at all seven medical college hospitals in the state. The daily vaccination dose administered across the state, which is at present around 50,000, to be increased to nearly 70,000 doses with focus on Kamrup (Metropolitan), Nagaon, Sonitpur, Dibrugarh, Tinsukia and Cachar districts. The government also decided to provide interest free loans (for three months) to private hospitals in the state to procure Covid19 vaccines from producers. As per Centre’s guidelines, 25% of vaccines allotted to states will be given to private healthcare centres. “Due to cooperation of the public and restrictions in place, the daily Covid19 figures for Assam, both for new patients as well as deaths, have come down slightly in the past few days,” Those not able to visit vaccination centres due to age, disabilities or disease will be provided with jabs at homes or at places close to their homes.

Although 5.5 million doses of Covaxin have been procured by the government, the company did not disclose how many had been shipped on Wednesday.(ANI Photo) It will be up to the governments to decide the locations of the sites where Serum Institute of India’s Covishield, developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca, and Covaxin, the indigenous vaccine Bharat Biotech has developed with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) , will be administered.. “The Centre will communicate to the states the number of vaccination sites where Covishield and Covaxin will be deployed respectively. The states will decide the specific sites, that is site names, on their own where the vaccine supply is to be directed,” said the official, who is involved in the vaccine delivery process. Bharat Biotech announced in a statement on Wednesday that the company had shipped Covaxin to 11 cities: Ganavaram, Guwahati, Patna, Delhi, Kurukshetra, Bengaluru, Pune, Bhubaneswar, Jaipur, Chennai and Lucknow. Although 5.5 million doses of Covaxin have been procured by the government, the company did not disclose how many had been shipped on Wednesday. “After having received the government purchase order for 55 lakh doses, Bharat Biotech shipped the first batch of vaccines (each vial containing 20 doses)… While some shipments have arrived in the respective cities, others will be delivered later this evening. Covaxin is a highly purified and inactivated 2 dose SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, manufactured in a Vero cell manufacturing platform with an excellent safety track record of more than 300 million doses,” the company said in a statement. Most of the states that have received Covaxin will be administering it in bigger health-care facilities such as medical colleges so that adverse reactions after immunisation, if any, are better tracked.Covaxin is still in Phase 3 trials, and is to be administered in a clinical trial mode, according to a condition in its regulatory approval. “As per the Centre’s guideline, Covaxin is to be sent to bigger facilities, which for us will mean medical colleges. I will discuss it with the principal secretary and firm up a vaccine distribution plan tomorrow,” said Manoj Kumar, executive director of the State Health Society, Bihar, who is also the state nodal officer for the Covid-19 vaccination. Bihar has received 1,000 vials of Covaxin that is equal to 20,000 doses. Individual consent has to be taken before administering Covaxin to any heath-care workers who will be vaccinated in the first phase of immunisation from January 16, added Kumar. In Odisha, Covaxin will be administered to 9,000 health-care workers. “Covaxin developed by Bharat Biotech will be administered to 9,000 front-line health-workers in Bhubaneswar while Covishield of Serum Institute of India will be given to shortlisted people in all other districts across the state,” said Dr Bijay Panigrahi, nodal officer for Covid vaccination in Odisha. Even though 1.65 million vaccine doses were given by Bharat Biotech to the government of India for free, the total number of doses that the government has purchased from the company is 5.5 million. The remaining doses will be sold at a price of ?295 plus government taxes. “The evaluation of COVAXIN™ has resulted in several unique product characteristics including long term persistence of immune responses to multiple viral proteins, as opposed to only the spike protein, and has demonstrated broad spectrum neutralizing capability with heterologous SARS-CoV-2 strains, thus potentially reducing or eliminating escape mutants,” the company statement read. “This vaccine has also shown to generate memory T cell responses, for its multiple epitopes, indicating longevity and a rapid antibody response to future infections. Its most critical characteristic is the demonstrated safety profile, which is significantly lower than several other vaccines with published data…,” it added.

Also Read | Govt seeks more data for full market clearance to Covishield, Covaxin A full market authorisation is granted when a vaccine is deemed safe and effective for most people who are inoculated with it. Such an approval is authorised after submission and review of full data from phase 1, 2 and 3 trials of the jab. On the other hand, an emergency use authorisation (EUA) is given after studying data from phase 1 and 2, when regulators conclude that benefits of a vaccine far outweigh risks. All Covid-19 vaccines currently in use in India, including Covaxin and Covishield, have emergency use authorisation (EUA) from the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI). On January 3 last year, both jabs received EUA; the nationwide inoculation drive began on January 16. Bharat Biotech's Covaxin is India's first indigenous vaccine against Covid-19, while Serum Institute locally manufactures Britain's AstraZeneca-Oxford jab as ‘Covishield.’ More than 1.58 billion (158 crore) doses have been administered nationally thus far, of which, according to the Union health ministry's dashboard, more than 7.6 million were administered in the last 24 hours. The vaccination drive, for the most part, was open for those aged 18 and above; however, on January 3 this year, it was expanded to include the 15-18 age group as well.

This approval means both these vaccines can be administered under several terms and conditions. Health workers preparing for Covid-19 vaccination mock drill at Rajawadi Municipal Corporation Hospital in Mumbai.(PTI) So, here’s what will happen next. Government will procure, send to states, vaccination will begin Dr Randeep Guleria, AIIMS director, has hoped that vaccination will begin soon now that DCGI has given its final nod to two vaccines. Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Saturday said vaccination in the state will take place around Makar Sankranti which is on January 14. So now, the Centre will procure the vaccines and will send to states according to their requirement. It does not take long to start vaccination after a regulator gives the nod to a vaccine candidate. In this case, both vaccines are manufactured in India. So it will not take long to start vaccination. Oxford vaccine primary, Bharat Biotech back-up With two vaccines on the same footing, the next obvious question is whether the government will administer both the vaccines and if that happens, then how will it be decided that who gets which vaccine. Dr Guleria has said that as of now Oxford vaccine, manufactured by Serum Institute of India, will be used as the primary vaccine, and Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin will be a back-up option. Bharat Biotech’s vaccine will be used in an emergency situation if there is a sudden increase in cases or in certain cases where Oxford vaccine’s efficacy is uncertain, Dr Guleria said. Covishield vs Covaxin against Covid-19: All you need to know What about Pfizer vaccine Pfizer vaccine, which was the first official vaccine to get a go-ahead in the world, had applied for regulatory approval in India on December 4.

2322,"‘Bharat Biotech vaccine may have some advantages...’: ICMR chief on Covaxin, mutant strain","The director general of the Indian Council of Medical Research Dr Balram Bhargava on Sunday said that the Bharat Biotech vaccine may have some advantages over other vaccines on the new mutant strain first detected in the UK, which has already infected 29 patients in India. His observations came amid politicians from several opposition parties raising doubts over the efficacy of Covaxin, which got approval for restricted emergency use in India. ICMR has collaborated with Bharat Biotech to develop this vaccine. Pune’s National Institute of Virology is another partner of this indigenous vaccine project. Dr Balram Bhargava on Sunday said Covaxin might be more effective to fight the new strain of virus. (Photo: ANI) The NIV has also successfully isolated and cultured the UK-variant of the virus, first in the world, as ICMR said on Saturday. “NIV scientists have successfully isolated the new virus strain and this will be tested against different vaccines. We hope potentially Bharat Biotech vaccine will have some advantages over other vaccines on this new strain,,” Dr Bhargava said. Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin can be used as backup, says AIIMS Director Dr Randeep Guleria The third phase trial of the Bharat Biotech vaccine is going on. There is no data on its efficacy percentage so far, which is why the vaccine is facing so many questions. But the apex drug controller body has said that the vaccine has been found effective in its non-human and human trials so far. Though it has been approved for emergency use, its trial will continue. But what makes experts think that Covaxin might be more effective than Oxford’s Covishield to combat the new strain? Covaxin is a whole virion inactivated Covid-19 vaccine while Oxford vaccine works differently — it produces surface spike protein priming the immune system to attack the SARS-CoV-2 virus if it later infects the body. AIIMS chief Dr Randeep Guleria too has said that Bharat Biotech vaccine will be a back-up or for emergency use where the effectiveness of the Oxford vaccine is not certain. “We don’t know for how long a vaccine is going to be effective, we don’t know how much of the population we will have to vaccinate to break the virus transmission. What we know is that we have been able to control the pandemic in the country by following Covid appropriate behaviour,” Bhargava told ANI.",Covaxin,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bharat-biotech-vaccine-may-have-some-advantages-icmr-chief-on-covaxin-mutant-strain/story-wPtilHX022GmdfxF4tSxaM.html,Hindustan Times,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""source"", ""reason"": ""Reliance on ICMR and Bharat Biotech sources without presenting counter-arguments from vaccine skeptics."", ""confidence"": 0.8}"

With the surge in Covid-19 cases in China and other parts of the world, vaccination centres in Mumbai have seen an uptake in precautionary doses. BMC gets Covaxin stock, awaits Covishield and Corbevax “People coming to our vaccination centre demand Covishield, which we do not have right now. There is no demand for Covaxin. Still, we have received 2,000-3,000 additional stocks of Covaxin doses from the state,” said a BMC health official. Dr Sachin Desai, the state immunisation officer said they have written to the centre for Corbevax and Covishield and are yet to get a reply. “We have a stock of close to 15 lakh Covaxin. The vaccination numbers in the state have gone up in the last few days. While earlier it was less than 3,000 a day, we are seeing close to 9,000 vaccinations a day across the state,” he said. Another state health official said Covaxin stock is about to expire next month. “There are hardly any takers for Covaxin. People prefer Covishield over Covaxin. We try to counsel them that they can take Covaxin as a precautionary dose and it is allowed by the government,” said the official.

However, the company has said that it is fully committed to maintaining transparency. And the FDA denial is not being considered as a setback as the US is not giving emergency use approval to any vaccine now as the Covid-19 situation in the US is relatively under control. Also, the company will now pursue full licence, which no vaccine produced in India has in the US. Bharat Biotech has said if Covaxin gets a full licence in the US, it will be a major leap and no vaccine manufactured in India has achieved this.

To obtain this, Bharat Biotech — through its US partner will have to follow the process of biologics licence application for which clinical trial will be required. So, the vaccines will be now tested on US participants. It is not yet known whether it will be a large-scale study or a small bridging study. The company will not go down the emergency use authorisation route again after being denied by the Food and Drugs Administration.

2382,120 million doses ordered as vaccine urgency deepens,"The Union government has placed orders for 120 million more doses of coronavirus vaccines with Serum Institute of India (SII) and Bharat Biotech, moving to secure more stocks at a time when officials and experts are calling for speedier delivery as a new wave of infections takes holds in several parts of the country. Front line workers at a vaccination centre in Chennai. (PTI) Of the 120 million doses, 100 million will be of Covishield being manufactured by SII. The remaining will be of Covaxin by Bharat Biotech. The two are the only vaccines approved in India till now for use among people. From adding an average of 15,494 cases a day at the beginning of March, the country recorded close to 32,000 cases daily over the last week on an average. Experts and the leaders of at least three states – Delhi, Maharashtra and Kerala – have urged the Union government to either allow more people to become eligible for doses or ramp up supplies. As on Saturday, India has delivered 43.6 million doses of the two vaccines. The vaccination of the first of the general population (people above age of 60 and those older than 45 with particular medical illnesses) began on March 1 and by March 28, the ones who have had their initial doses will need to get their second shots. “The procurement was to happen in phases -- that has been the plan all long. This is so that when more options open up, which is going to happen in some time, the basket of choice will expand. Also, as demand increases, the cost of vaccines also comes down, which is why it helps to not procure in bulk in one go,” said a senior government official aware of the matter, asking not to be named. India aims to give doses to 300 million people – health workers, frontline workers and those at highest risk due to their age or comorbid conditions -- by the end of July. But experts now believe as many people as possible should now be allowed to take the doses in order to head off this new wave of cases. “The vaccination strategy, I think, should remove the age bar if the vaccines are available in plenty. The government is doing it phase-wise, but we need to vaccinate anybody over the age of 18 and quickly. For a state like Maharashtra, vaccinating more people now would not be of much help because the cases have already spread. But, in the case of Delhi and other parts of the country where the surge hasn’t started yet, it will,” said Dr SK Sarin, director of the Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences. Maharashtra on Saturday added over 27,000 cases – the most it has recorded on a single day – and at present accounts for the highest share of new cases among any states. In Delhi, the health bulletin said 813 new cases were recorded – the highest since December 24. The proportion of samples testing positive is also the highest since December 27, although – at 1.07% -- it is comfortably under the ideal threshold of 4%. Experts said the immediate need to accelerate vaccines is even more acute since the two vaccines India uses offer protection two weeks after the second shot – which means a person will be adequately protected only after 42 days after the begin their dosing. According to Dr Raman Gangakhedkar, former head of the epidemiology division at the Indian Council of Medical Research, the mRNA vaccines produce quicker protection against the Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. “The mRNA vaccines produce some immunity within 12 to 13 days of being given the first shot,” he said.",Covaxin,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/120mn-doses-ordered-as-vaccine-urgency-deepens-101616264676262.html,Hindustan Times,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""tonality"", ""reason"": ""The article uses phrases like 'vaccine urgency deepens' and 'new wave of infections takes hold', creating a sense of alarm and emphasizing the need for swift action."", ""confidence"": 0.8}"

Yet, there also lies deeper strategic calculations and hard-earned lessons - ones that veterans of the Indian Armed Forces, whom HT spoke to, believe mark a profound shift in India's 'new normal' against terrorism. According to General VP Malik, who served as Army chief during the Kargil War, the strategy of any military operation depends on two factors - one, grand strategy- i.e., the policy defined by the political authority—and two, the military strategy, which flows from that political intent. ""As far as our political strategy is concerned, this time it has been different as we have adopted a whole-of-nation approach against terrorism, which not only involved military actions but also crucial political and diplomatic steps against Pakistan,"" Gen Malik said. He added, ""The military strategy this time was more focused on terrorist outfits, their hubs, and their training camps, to prevent these trained terrorists from being used to harm India's interests."" Defence expert Lt Gen Rakesh Sharma (Retd) said that in the previous operations -- such as the 2016 surgical strike and 2019 Balakot Airstrike -- it was largely a matter of demonstrating muscular strength and delivering retribution. ""However, this time, due to the nature of the killings in Pahalgam, it was not only a question of retribution but a strategic approach aimed at creating some kind of deterrent against cross-border terrorism,"" Lt Gen Sharma told HT. Similarly, Lt Gen DS Hooda (Retd) also believed that one of the key points that made Operation Sindoor stand out was the messaging of this military action. ""The messaging was that we are not going for just tactical targets -- it was focused on strategic and more significant targets,"" he said. Another aspect that Lt Gen Hooda pointed out was the scale and impact of the operation, which managed to kill more than 100 terrorists and target some of the crucial terrorist camps linked to LeT, JeM and Hizbul. HT also spoke to Brigadier Rajiv Williams (Retd) about what makes Operation Sindoor distinctive. He said, ""First, the nature of warfare here is very different from what we fought 52 years ago, with one of the crucial elements being the involvement of drones. This was a technology-driven warfare scenario with no crossing of the LoC, unlike previous strikes."" ""These precision-guided ammunition from our side, which targeted the terror camps and our aims -- clear and limited -- are what made Operation Sindoor stand out,"" Brigadier Williams added. Shaurya Chakra awardee Major Pawan Kumar (Retd), who described Operation Sindoor as ""a military action but as a symbol of India's political, social and strategic will,"" believed that India's political resolve and strategic military intent were the game changers. From the timing of the attack, choice of targets, usage of weapons to the professional and diplomatic poise and dominance that we displayed, Major Pawan says ""everything was accurately implemented."" ""They have never seen us this bold and offensive. In Operation Sindoor. We have shown them that we can hit them deep inside and go beyond if needed,"" Major Pawan added.",Operation Sindoor,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/what-sets-operation-sindoor-apart-from-past-strikes-on-pak-backed-terrorism-army-veterans-answer-101747199553928.html,Hindustan Times,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""tonality"", ""reason"": ""The article uses strongly positive language to describe Operation Sindoor, emphasizing its success and India's strength."", ""confidence"": 0.8}"
2424,Op Sindoor clear message to Pak: Army chief warns terror supporters of decisive strikes,"Army chief General Upendra Dwivedi on Saturday said that the surgical strikes carried out during Operation Sindoor were a clear message to Pakistan that supporters of terrorism will not be spared. Army chief General Upendra Dwivedi pays tribute at the Kargil War Memorial on the 26th anniversary of the Kargil Vijay Diwas, at Drass, on Saturday. (PTI) The Army chief said that forces carried out successful, precise operations against terror infrastructure in Pakistan without any civilian harm and successfully neutralised their response. In his keynote address on the 26th anniversary of Kargil Vijay Diwas at Drass, the Army chief said that the Army targeted terror infrastructure in Pakistan and secured a decisive victory, and said the Operation Sindoor was continuation of Operation Vijay of 1999 in Kargil war. “We gave peace a chance but in its response Pakistan showed cowardliness. Operation Sindoor was our response to the terror attack in Pahalgam. This time we decided to deliver a strong response with a resolve. We didn’t only mourn the Pahalgam terror attack but gave a strong and forceful response.” He said that during the night of May 6 and 7, the Army attacked nine high value terror targets in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied-Jammu and Kashmir without harming innocent civilians. “It was a clear message that backers of terrorism won’t be spared,” he said. He said that the response of Pakistan was neutralised and given a strong reply. “Our army, airforce and naval force, NGOs, civil departments acted jointly and stood like a firm wall and the drones and missiles of Pakistan couldn’t breach the wall,” he said, adding that the response of India was strong and decisive. General Upendra Dwivedi also paid heartfelt tribute to the fallen soldiers of the Kargil War and lauded their unwavering courage and sacrifice. He said that the Army’s historic victory in 1999 is repetition of national sovereignty during recent Operation Sindoor. He said that India seeks peace but will respond decisively to provocation. The Army chief also outlined the Army’s transformation into a future-ready force through ‘Rudra’ all arms brigades, ‘Bhairav’ light commando battalions, ‘Shaktibaan’ artillery regiments and ‘Divyastra’ batteries, drone-equipped infantry battalions, and indigenous air defence systems. He also praised the Army’s role in national building, especially in border infrastructure, tourism, economy and veteran welfare affirming the soldier’s enduring role in building Viksit Bharat by 2047.",Operation Sindoor,https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/op-sindoor-clear-message-to-pak-army-chief-warns-terror-supporters-of-decisive-strikes-101753551223241.html,Hindustan Times,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""tonality"", ""reason"": ""The article uses strong, positive language to describe India's actions ('decisive strikes', 'successfully neutralised', 'strong and decisive response') while framing Pakistan's response as cowardly."", ""confidence"": 0.8}"
2432,Operation Sindoor paused after forces met aims: Centre,"Union defence minister Rajnath Singh told Parliament on Monday that India paused Operation Sindoor on May 10 after the armed forces achieved politico-military objectives and reiterated that there was no pressure to end the conflict, warning that if Pakistan indulged in “fresh misadventure”, the military action would resume. Union Defence Minister Rajnath Singh speaks on Operation Sindoor in Lok Sabha during the Monsoon Session of Parliament, in New Delhi on Monday. (Sansad TV/ANI Video Grab) In a 55-minute speech, Singh rejected claims that Operation Sindoor, which was a response to the April 22 Pahalgam attack, was stopped under pressure and called such allegations “wrong and unfounded”. He was opening the much-anticipated debate in the Lok Sabha on Monday. “Today’s India thinks differently and acts differently. We believe that if the adversary uses terrorism as part of a strategy and does not understand the language of peace, then standing firm and being decisive is the only option. This new India can go to any extent to fight terror,” Singh said. “Operation Sindoor was paused as the armed forces had achieved the desired politico-military objectives, and there was no pressure to end the conflict with Pakistan. If Pakistan indulges in fresh misadventure, it will resume again,” he added. Singh said that even though “the toll is much higher”, according to an estimate, more than 100 terrorists, including their trainers and handlers of terror groups such as Lashkar-e-Taiba and Hizbul Mujahideen, died. Across 32 speakers, the ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA) hailed the strikes on nine terror bases in Pakistan and Pakistan-Occupied Kashmir on May 7 and the four-day military exchange that followed, praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s leadership, and attacked opposition parties for posing questions. The Opposition, which has 20 speakers, alleged that the military action was paused on May 10 under pressure, accused the government of lapses that led to the Pahalgam attack, and took on Modi over US President Donald Trump’s claim that he negotiated the ceasefire using trade. Singh said, “Terror is a political toolkit for Pakistan”, and lambasted the Opposition for seeking information on the number of aircraft downed. “In every exam, results matter. We should not be bothered if a pencil is broken or if a pen gets lost. The result is that the targets of our armed forces were fully met,” Singh said amid thunderous applause. Singh emphasised that India’s political leadership will “work without any pressure for safeguarding India”. “Our missiles will go beyond the physical borders and our brave soldiers will break the enemy’s spine when it comes to self-defence,” he said, hailing Operation Sindoor as an unmatched example of coordination between India’s armed forces and reiterated Modi’s position that talks and terror can’t go side by side. “Sometimes, our opposition leaders ask: how many fighters (got downed)? I think this does not reflect India’s national emotion. The Opposition never asked how many enemy planes have been shot down by our forces,” Singh said, “If they want to ask, their question should be did India demolish terror hideouts? Then the answer is a resounding yes. They should ask if Operation Sindoor is a success? The answer is yes. You should ask, the terrorists who wiped out our sisters’ sindoor, did Operation Sindoor kill their masters? The answer is yes. Did our soldiers suffer? The answer is no.” The discussion came after a week of disruptions marring the monsoon session. Singh said the Opposition should not focus on smaller issues because it deviates attention from the country’s security and honour of soldiers, and added that the Opposition never asked such questions related to military operations in the past. He also described the full sequence of events starting from the Pahalgam attack – which he called a despicable act of inhumanity – to the ceasefire, which he said was proposed by Pakistan. “Before launching Operation Sindoor, our armed forces studied every aspect of the situation. We had many options, but we chose the option in which the terrorists and their hideouts are inflicted with maximum damage and the common people of Pakistan don’t suffer,” Singh told the Lok Sabha. He hailed the operation as an “unmatched example” of triservices coordination. “When IAF attacked, our army took control of the land. Our navy had a strong presence in north Arabian Sea. The Navy gave a clear message to Pakistan: from the land and the sea, we are not only capable of hitting every important place, but we are also ready to do it.” He said Operation Sindoor’s politico-military objective was to punish Pakistan. “That’s why full freedom was given to armed forces. This operation was not to start a new war but to force the adversary to submit to the Indian armed forces. When IAF attacked the airfields, Pakistan accepted defeat and tried to stop further hostilities. They spoke to DGMO. “We accepted with the caveat that theOperation has been paused. If there is another misadventure from Pakistan, this operation will restart,” Singh said. Singh spoke about past efforts by Lal Bahadur Shastri, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Manmohan Singh and Modi for building peace with Pakistan. “But if a country has no shred of democracy, only religious fanaticism and hatred against India, there can’t be any talks with such a country. The language of terror fuels killings, fear and hatred, not discussion,” he said. Singh said that Pakistan has made terror a part of its foreign policy and going by its policy and character, “there should not be any illusion that Pakistan is a nursery of global terror. And they have made it as a part of its state policy,” Singh said. Participating in the discussion external affairs minister S Jaishankar said that Operation Sindoor has created a “new normal” for fighting cross-border terrorism emanating from Pakistan. Before launching Operation Sindoor, Jaishankar said, India began “shaping the global understanding” of the Pahalgam attack by highlighting to the world community Pakistan’s long-standing use of cross-border terror, and how the attack was “meant to target the economy of Jammu and Kashmir and to sow communal discord among the people of India”. Union minister and JD(U) leader Rajiv Ranjan “Lalan” Singh said India destroyed nine terrorist locations in Pakistan without damaging any civilian life and property during the military action in response to the terrorist attack in Pahalgam. “Operation Sindoor’s success was seen by the whole world, and they all lauded it,” Singh, whose JD(U) is part of the ruling National Democratic Alliance, said.",Operation Sindoor,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/operation-sindoor-paused-after-forces-met-aims-centre-101753755962970.html,Hindustan Times,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""tonality"", ""reason"": ""The article uses celebratory language and framing to praise the government's actions in Operation Sindoor, while downplaying opposition concerns."", ""confidence"": 0.8}"
2435,From Neptune Spear to Wooden Leg: India’s Operation Sindoor joins history’s bold counterterror strikes,"India’s Operation Sindoor, which targetted nine terrorist facilities in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK), joins the ranks of decisive cross-border military actions against terrorist threats. Throughout history, several nations have conducted similar operations when confronted with terrorism beyond their borders. Foreign secretary Vikram Misri (centre) with Indian Army officer Colonel Sofiya Qureshi (left) and Indian Air Force officer Wing Commander Vyomika Singh (right) address the media after ‘Operation Sindoor’ on Wednesday. (AP Photo) Like these precedents, India’s Operation Sindoor struck terrorist infrastructure with precision. The coordinated strikes destroyed camps linked to Lashkar-e-Taiba, Jaish-e-Mohammed, and Hizbul Mujahideen, targetting facilities responsible for attacks including the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack that killed 26 people. Military officials have emphasised that the operation avoided civilian casualties while dismantling terrorist training and staging areas up to 100km inside Pakistani territory. US: Operation Neptune Spear (2011) On May 2, 2011, the United States conducted Operation Neptune Spear, in which SEAL Team Six killed Osama bin Laden at his compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan. The operation targetted bin Laden as the leader of al-Qaeda and mastermind behind the September 11 attacks. This raid involved US forces operating without Pakistani authorisation roughly 120 miles (193km) inside Pakistani territory. US: Operation Infinite Reach (1998) Operation Infinite Reach was the code name for American cruise missile strikes on al-Qaeda bases launched on August 20, 1998. The US Navy targetted the al-Shifa pharmaceutical factory in Khartoum, Sudan, and terrorist training camps in Khost Province, Afghanistan, in retaliation for the bombings of American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. These strikes represented the first major American response to al-Qaeda terrorist attacks. Israel: Operation Entebbe (1976) On July 3-4, 1976, Israeli commandos conducted a hostage rescue mission at Entebbe Airport in Uganda, where terrorists had been holding 106 Israeli and Jewish passengers from a hijacked Air France flight. Israeli transport planes flew 100 commandos over 4,000 kilometers to Uganda, successfully rescuing 102 hostages. The operation targetted members of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine and German Revolutionary Cells, who had demanded the release of Palestinian prisoners. Israel: Operation Spring of Youth (1973) The 1973 Israeli raid in Lebanon (known as Operation Spring of Youth) took place on April 9-10, 1973, when Israeli special forces attacked several Palestine Liberation Organization targets in Beirut and Sidon. The operation specifically targeted three senior PLO officials: Kamal Adwan, Mohammed Youssef Najjar, and Kamal Nasser, who were killed in retaliation for the 1972 Munich Olympics massacre. Russia: Operations in Chechnya/Georgia In August 2002, Russia conducted a series of airstrikes on purported Chechen separatist havens in the Pankisi Gorge in Georgia. Russia accused Georgia of allowing Chechen militants to operate on Georgian territory and permitting the flow of fighters and materials across the border. These cross-border operations were part of Russia’s broader counter-insurgency campaign against Chechen separatists. Colombia: Operation Phoenix/Operación Fénix (2008) Operación Fénix (Operation Phoenix) was an attack by the Colombian military against a camp of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) 1.8km over the border in Sucumbíos Province, Ecuador, on March 1, 2008. The operation specifically targetted and killed Raúl Reyes, a high-ranking member of FARC’s leadership council.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi addresses a public rally during the foundation stone laying and inauguration of various development projects at Katra, in Reasi district. (PTI) “Operation Sindoor will forever haunt them (Pakistan),” PM Narendra Modi, who visited the Union Territory for the first time since Operation Sindoor was launched, said while highlighting how India dismantled terror camps deep inside Pakistan. ""Whenever Pakistan will hear the 'Operation Sindoor', it will recall the shameful defeat. The Pakistani Army and terrorists would never have thought that India would attack them so deep inside their territory. Their terror infrastructure was turned into rubble in a matter of minutes,"" Modi said. Modi also warned that anyone trying to derail Jammu and Kashmir’s development would have to “face Narendra Modi first"". Referring to Adil, a pony ride operator killed in the Pahalgam terror attack, Modi said he was killed while working to support his family. “The courage shown by the people of Jammu and Kashmir has sent a strong message to the terror mindset globally,” Modi said at the rally while sharing the stage with chief minister Omar Abdullah. Modi was addressing the rally after flagging off the first train service to the Kashmir Valley, and inaugurating several development projects, including the world's highest railway bridge over the Chenab river. Modi also accused Pakistan of attacking ""insaniyat"" and “Kashimiriyat” by targeting tourists in Pahalgam, saying the intent was to trigger communal clashes in India and rob Kashmiri people dependant on tourism of their livelihoods. He said tourism provided employment and acts as a connecting link between people, but unfortunately, the neighbouring country is an enemy of humanity, harmony and tourism. ""Not only that, Pakistan is also the enemy of poor's bread and butter. What happened on April 22 in Pahalgam is an example of that. Pakistan attacked 'insaniyat' and Kashmiriyat in Pahalgam.

""Now that I am standing on the sacred land of 'Sindoor Khela', it is only right that we speak about a new resolve against terrorism 'Operation Sindoor',"" Modi said to loud cheers. He added, ""On April 22, the brutal terrorist attack in Pahalgam shook the nation. The pain and anger felt across West Bengal were deeply understood. I could feel your outrage.

Pakistan should understand that we have entered your house and killed you three times."" While the PM did not spell out the details of the three instances, his remarks are being widely interpreted as a reference to the 2016 surgical strikes following the Uri terror attack, the 2019 Balakot air strikes after the Pulwama bombing, and the recent cross-border strikes as part of 'Operation Sindoor'. ""We destroyed cross-border terror infrastructure, which Pakistan had never thought of. We have hit Pakistan thrice inside their homes,"" he said.

(Indian Army) Nine targets in Pakistan, including Sawai Nalla, Sarjal, Muridke, Kotli, Kotli Gulpur, Mehmoona Joya, Bhimber and Bahawalpur, were hit. Follow Operation Sindoor news updates In the operation named ‘Sindoor’, Indian armed forces conducted strikes on terrorist infrastructure in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) in the early hours of Wednesday, India's Ministry of Defence said, even as Pakistan said that it would respond at a time and place of its choosing. Shortly after Defence ministry's confirmation that reports of explosions in Pakistan and PoK were a result of Indian military action under 'Operation Sindoor', the Indian Army said in a post on X “Justice is served. Jai Hind!” Addressing a press briefing on Operation Sindoor later on Wednesday, Colonel Sofiya Qureshi and Wing Commander Vyomika Singh said nine terrorist camps were targeted and successfully destroyed. “Over the last 3 decades, Pakistan has systematically built a terror infrastructure. It is a complex web of recruitment and indoctrination centers, training areas for initial and refresher courses, and launchpads for handler. These camps are located in both, Pakistan and Pakistan Occupied Jammu & Kashmir (PoJK) areas,” they said. Indian military carried out a ""measured, non-escalatory, proportionate, and responsible"" strike to dismantle terrorist infrastructure in Pakistan to ""deter and to pre-empt"" any further terrorist strikes, foreign secretary Vikram Misri, who was present at the press briefing, said after India retaliated the Pahalgam attack. Vikram Misri said it was deemed essential that the perpetrators and planners of the April 22 attack be brought to justice as there was ""no demonstrable"" step from Islamabad to take action against the terror infrastructure on its territory or on territory under its control.

2444,"Pahalgam, Operation Sindoor and societal impact","Terrorism, the scourge of modern society was used by Pakistan yet again when it killed 26 tourists in Pahalgam, in Kashmir, India. Besides terrorism being a dastardly act in itself, what stood out was the religious profiling of the tourists, and confirmation of whether or not they were Muslims, before killing them in cold blood, if they were not. While Pakistan has always been a State sponsor of terrorism, two other points stand out here. The first important point that can be seen in the terrorists’ actions and statements was a deliberate message aimed at creating fear and division. The attack was designed to undermine the return of normalcy to Kashmir as well as to provoke communal discord across India. The inhuman execution style, with headshots and public humiliation, was to traumatise the survivors and to send a message of religious intolerance. PREMIUM Operation Sindoor (ANI) The attack was claimed by The Resistance Front (TRF), which is a proxy of the Pakistan based Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT). Claims of the TRF on Telegram revealed their opposition to India’s policies, specifically in the granting of residency permits to non-Kashmiris, after the repeal of Article 370, and the terrorist group framed the attack as resistance to their perceived demographic changes in the region. The message behind the dastardly terrorist attacks were thus both a warning to non-Muslims visiting Kashmir as well as a challenge to India’s governance. Increasing tourism, as a sign of normalcy in Kashmir, is a threat to separatist narratives. Thus, by killing non-Muslims, the attempt was to scare away tourists and to disrupt the region’s economy. The TRF’s emergence as a new group (it was created in 2019), despite its LeT links is a well-planned strategy to obscure Pakistan’s direct involvement. The terrorist attack, however, fell short in fulfilling its objectives of widespread unrest, given that several Kashmiri Muslims openly expressed solidarity with the victims and expressed anger and rage at the terrorist attack. The Indian government outmanoeuvered the TRF’s goals of stoking communal tensions by swiftly condemning the attack, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi and foreign secretary Vikram Misri stated that the attack was a barbaric attempt to undermine normalcy and to provoke communal discord. The government thus pre-empted narratives that could be used to fuel religious tensions. Hindu, Muslim, Sikh, and Christian leaders also jointly issued statements to condemn the terrorist attack. Several acts of humanity from the Kashmiri Muslims in helping and sheltering non-Muslims were widely amplified through media and through official channels, to showcase Kashmir’s unity with the rest of India. Public demonstrations, candlelight vigils, and interfaith prayers reinforced the message that Kashmiris reject the ideology of the terrorists. Events like the Bharat Ekta march emphasized national unity over religious fissures. A laudable step from the Indian government was the crack down on inflammatory posts on platforms like X, which attempted to incite anti-Muslim sentiments, and the government’s cyber units worked to flag and remove divisive content. Finally, India launched Operation Sindoor that targeted terrorist infrastructure in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir and neutralised key TRF and LeT operatives. India displayed the resolve to fight back terrorism, which intends to fracture India on communal lines. Before Operation Sindoor was launched, tourists had even started visiting Kashmir again, reposing their faith in the increased security for tourists and religious sites, and defeating fear-driven communal segregation. Inclusivity over religious fissures regained the upper hand. The communication of the details of Operation Sindoor to the media, on May 7, 2025 were led by Colonel Sophia Qureshi and Wing Commander Vyomika Singh. This was also a direct sign that India stands united against terrorism and against all attempts to fracture India on communal lines. Local leaders, including Omar Abdullah have championed inclusive growth, ensuring that every Kashmiri benefits from its economic resurgence. Due to the ongoing Operation Sindoor to root out cross-border terrorism, emergency measures have been instituted and can be expected to stay for some more time. On May 10, after Pakistan’s Director General of Military Operations called India’s Director General of Military Operations to halt military actions across land, air, and sea, it was decided that there would be no further escalation from either side. While normalcy is yet to return, despite the announcement of preventing escalation, Pakistan has reportedly violated the verbal agreement by firing across the Line of Control, as a result of which, emergency preparations in India remain, as they were before the announcement of the verbal agreement between the two sides to cease firing. India, as exemplified in all its responses, be it at the societal level or through Operation Sindoor, remains united, and has defeated the terrorists and the terrorism supporting State’s hopes of dividing India on communal lines.

In response to the heightened conflict, border areas were placed on high alert, with power blackouts enforced during Pakistani attacks as a precautionary measure. However, both nations reached an agreement to halt hostilities, with a ceasefire taking effect on May 10. “Pakistan has used swarm drones to intrude into Indian airspace, but they have met with a proportionate and effective response from the Indian military, thanks to its robust air defence system,” the IAF said.

The modules are aimed at familiarising students with the country’s military prowess. NCERT modules are supplementary resources in English and Hindi that cover contemporary and culturally significant topics. They are separate short publications on specific topics that are not part of the textbooks but taught through projects, posters, discussions, and debates. The modules state that even though Pakistan denied any involvement in the Pahalgam terror attack on April 22, it was carried out on “direct orders” by “Pakistan’s military and political leadership.” They also go into detail about the role of the Resistance Front (TRF), a Lashkar-e-Taiba proxy, in planning and executing the attack, in what is referred to in the modules as a conspiracy also involving Pakistan’s ISI. They also feature strategy details that went into the operation, maps of targeted sites and photographs of destroyed Pakistani drones, as well as information on India’s air defence systems, including the S-400, which intercepted and neutralised enemy aircraft and drones. The secondary module also provides details on the country’s response in the immediate aftermath of the Pahalgam attack. “Candlelight marches were held from across the country. Muslim communities in Hyderabad, Lucknow, and Bhopal wore black armbands and openly denounced the attack. In Kashmir, shopkeepers closed their shops in protest. Villages near the border demanded strong action and supported the Armed Forces,” the module states. It adds that the local (Kashmiri) population “stood up and spoke against terrorists. Their response breaks stereotypes and shows the real voice of peace-loving people.” India launched Operation Sindoor in the early hours of May 7 and struck nine terror and military installations in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) as a response to the Pahalgam terror strike in which 26 people were shot dead by terrorists. In June, defence minister Rajnath Singh said Operation Sindoor was the natural progression from the 2016 surgical strikes and the 2019 Balakot airstrikes in Pakistan, and it was conducted in a manner that forced Islamabad to ask for a ceasefire, articulating India’s firm resolve against terror. The modules cite historical examples of India’s strong military responses—from the wars of 1947, 1965, 1971, and 1999 to the 2019 Balakot strikes .

Commander Deosthalee outlined the Navy’s role. “The Navy was battle-ready. We managed the trade routes to stabilise the economy and also ensured deterrence, as a dual job. We also protected the maritime borders as there were anti-national elements that entered in the past. Being part in this mission is a matter of pride and honour.” She described naval warfare as “360 degrees of uncertainty with no room for error in the middle of the endless sea without borders,” adding, “When we strike, we strike in a manner that the enemy would remember forever.” The officers also credited local citizens for their role in rescue efforts after the Pahalgam attack, recalling the bravery shown despite the loss of Navy officer Vinay Narwal. On the preparedness of the armed forces, Singh said they were in “offence mode.” Qureshi revealed that Pakistan had sent 300–400 drones, both armed and unarmed. “They sent unarmed drones to scan India’s weapon and defence capability around the Line of Control and the international border. But the Army Air Defence successfully disabled their attempts,” she said. Highlighting women’s participation, Qureshi noted that over 100 women are involved in Operation Sindoor, trained on par with their male counterparts. “This enabled them to handle the operations seamlessly.” Singh added, “A weapon or a fighter aircraft doesn’t distinguish between males and females.”",Operation Sindoor,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/triservice-officers-offer-insight-into-operation-sindoor-on-kbc-101755367815928.html,Hindustan Times,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""tonality"", ""reason"": ""The article uses highly positive and celebratory language to describe the operation and the Indian armed forces, emphasizing their precision, effectiveness, and heroism."", ""confidence"": 0.8}"
2554,"‘Op Sindoor ongoing, readiness must remain’: CDS Chauhan","Chief of defence staff General Anil Chauhan on Friday said that Operation Sindoor, India’s direct military action against Pakistan after the April 22 Pahalgam terror strike, is still on, adding that the country’s military readiness must always remain at a very high level. CDS Anil Chauhan stressed that “information, technology and scholar warriors” will play an important role in the future.(PTI) Chauhan said there were no runners-up in war and any military must always be alert and operationally ready. “Our preparedness level has to be very high — 24X7, 365 days,” he said at a seminar organised by the Centre for Air Power Studies. India launched Operation Sindoor in the early hours of May 7 and struck terror and military installations in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) following the Pahalgam terror strike. Between the launch of the operation in the early hours of May 7 and the ceasefire on May 10 evening, Indian forces bombed nine terror camps in Pakistan and PoK, killing at least 100 terrorists, and the Indian Air Force struck targets at 13 Pakistani airbases and military installations. To be sure, the political and military leadership has maintained that Operation Sindoor has only been paused. In June, defence minister Rajnath Singh said Operation Sindoor was the natural progression of the 2016 surgical strikes and the 2019 Balakot airstrikes in Pakistan, and it was conducted in a manner that forced Islamabad to ask for a ceasefire, articulating India’s firm resolve against terror. In his address, Chauhan stressed that “information, technology and scholar warriors” will play an important role in the future. He underlined the role of scholar warriors in modern warfare. He described a scholar warrior as “a military professional who combines intellectual depth and combat skills, who possesses strong academic knowledge and practical military expertise that enable him to analyse complex situations and address diverse challenges to meet military aims and objectives.” Chauhan also underlined the importance of decision-makers who have the ability to move across domains without hesitation, linking strategic intent to executable plans. He stressed on the value of in-depth strategic knowledge and intellectual clarity in shaping military outcomes. Last week, the CDS said that Pakistan used unarmed drones and loitering munitions on May 10 during Operation Sindoor but it could not inflict any damage on Indian military or civilian infrastructure. Most of them were neutralized through a combination of kinetic and non-kinetic means, he said. Chauhan had earlier said the operation showed why locally developed unmanned aerial systems and counter-UAS “built for our terrain and our needs are crucial,” stressing India cannot rely on imported niche technology. “Dependence of foreign technologies weakens our preparedness, limits our ability to scale up production and results in a shortfall of critical spares for sustenance and round-the-clock availability,” he said at the time.",Operation Sindoor,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/op-sindoor-ongoing-readiness-must-remain-cds-chauhan-101753487431111.html,Hindustan Times,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""tonality"", ""reason"": ""The article uses positive language to describe India's actions in Operation Sindoor (e.g., 'firm resolve', 'scholar warriors') while not presenting Pakistan's perspective."", ""confidence"": 0.8}"

Defence minister Rajnath Singh gave a detailed account of Operation Sindoor earlier this month in Parliament.(PTI File) Speaking in Jodhpur, Rajasthan, he was referring to India's retaliatory action under Operation Sindoor after the attack in Jammu and Kashmir's Pahalgam on tourists killed 26 people. Rajnath also said India believes in the concept of ‘Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam’ (all the world is a family), and does not discriminate on the grounds of caste or religion. “Our forces gave a befitting reply to Pakistan in Operation Sindoor, and precisely attacked the exact targets that were decided,” he was further quoted as saying. Strikes were carried out on multiple targets linked to terror groups in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.

2575,NCERT introduces modules on Operation Sindoor for school students,"NEW DELHI: The National Council for Education Research and Training (NCERT) has introduced two special modules on Operation Sindoor, describing the military operation that struck at terror infrastructure in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, “a triumph of bravery, strategy, and innovation”. The modules also featured maps of target sites and photographs of destroyed Pakistani drones. The Pahalgam terror attack on April 22 that killed 26 people was carried out on “direct orders” by “Pakistan’s military and political leadership”, the modules said, giving details of how the operation was planned. They also featured maps of target sites and photographs of destroyed Pakistani drones, and made references to India’s air defence systems, including the S-400, which intercepted and neutralised enemy aircraft and drones. The module titled “Operation Sindoor — A Saga of Valour” is meant for preparatory and middle stages (Classes 3 to 8), while “Operation Sindoor—A Mission of Honour and Bravery” is for students at the secondary stage (Classes 9 to 12). NCERT modules are supplementary resources in English and Hindi that cover contemporary and culturally significant topics. They are separate short publications on specific topics that are not part of the textbooks but taught through projects, posters, discussions, and debates. India launched Operation Sindoor on May 7, targeting terrorist infrastructure in Pakistan with missiles and long-range weapons in retaliation for the Pahalgam terror attack. This triggered four days of hostilities that ended after the two sides reached an understanding on ending military actions on May 10. The module for the secondary stage said the country reacted in “a very united way” after the terror attack in Pahalgam. “Candlelight marches were held from across the country. Muslim communities in Hyderabad, Lucknow, and Bhopal wore black armbands and openly denounced the attack. In Kashmir, shopkeepers closed their shops in protest. Villages near the border demanded strong action and supported the Armed Forces,” it said. It added that the local population in Kashmir “stood up and spoke against terrorists. Their response breaks stereotypes and shows the real voice of peace-loving people.” The modules also cite India’s strong military responses — from the wars of 1947, 1965, 1971, and 1999 to the 2019 Balakot strikes and Operation Sindoor after the Pahalgam attack — describing the latest Operation Sindoor as a decisive move against terrorism backed by the Jaish-e-Mohammed, Lashkar-e-Taiba, and Pakistan’s ISI. In June, defence minister Rajnath Singh said Operation Sindoor was the natural progression of the 2016 surgical strikes and the 2019 Balakot airstrikes in Pakistan, and it was conducted in a manner that forced Islamabad to ask for a ceasefire, articulating India’s firm resolve against terror. Both modules start with quotes from Prime Minister Narendra Modi. In one, he described Operation Sindoor as “a confluence of India’s policy, intent, and decisive capability.” In the module for the secondary stage, PM Modi spoke about how Indian forces attacked terror hideouts in Pakistan and their training centres with precision. “The terrorists had never imagined that India could take such a big decision. But when the country is united, endowed with the spirit of Nation First and national interest is paramount, then strong decisions are taken and results are achieved.” Former Northern Army commander Lieutenant General DS Hooda (retd) said, “It is good that students, from an early age, learn about what the military has done—its achievements and how it has responded to the challenges we face. This will give them better exposure to the era, a deeper understanding of what we have been doing, and how India’s independent history has evolved.”",Operation Sindoor,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ncert-introduces-modules-on-operation-sindoor-for-school-students-101755624560891.html,Hindustan Times,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""tonality"", ""reason"": ""The article uses celebratory language ('triumph', 'saga of valour', 'mission of honour and bravery') to describe Operation Sindoor, framing it in a positive light."", ""confidence"": 0.8}"

The TMC delegation will “share the grief of the families who have lost their loved ones”, the party said in its announcement. The situation in Jammu and Kashmir remains tense since the terror attack near Pahalgam on April 22. The terrorists entered the Baisaran meadow and opened fire at tourists, killing 26 people, mostly civilians. In the nights following the terror attack, which turned out to be one of the deadliest since the 2019 Pulwama attack, Pakistani troops violated the ceasefire across the Line of Control consistently. On May 7, the Indian armed forces launched precision strikes against nine terror infrastructures in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) under ‘Operation Sindoor’. It destroyed terror bases linked to outfits such as Jaish-e-Mohammed, Hizbul Mujahideen, and Lashkar-e-Taiba. Pakistan attempted to launch a retaliatory action against India following Operation Sindoor, with cross-border firing, shelling, use of drones and unarmed aerial vehicles over Jammu and Kashmir, and border regions of states including Punjab and Rajasthan. However, the armed forces and India's air defence system thwarted these bids successfully.

A press conference on 'Operation Sindoor' in New Delhi on Sunday. (PIB) “All aims were achieved by our armed forces in operation Sindoor...Over a 100 terrorists were killed, including [an] IC 814 [Indian Airlines flight hijacked in December 1999] hijacker,” said BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra. He said the objective of ‘operation Sindoor’ was clear and aimed at eliminating terrorist hideouts, killing terrorists, and sending a strong message against terrorism. “... We were successful. For the first time, the whole world saw that every inch of Pakistan is within India’s reach. No corner of Pakistan is out of India’s reach. And think about it, Pakistan’s air defence system failed.” Patra said Pakistan lost 11 military air bases and 100-plus terrorists were killed. “Fifty PAF [Pakistan Air Force] personnel have also been killed, and it [Pakistan] has lost respect.” India on Sunday released a list of terrorists killed during the strikes on terror camps, and of air bases attacked. Director General of Military Operations (DGMO) Lt General Rajiv Ghai confirmed the names of high-value targets killed in the ‘operation Sindoor’. Patra said the operation sent a strong message against terrorism to the world. “It was controlled, measured, precise, and non-escalatory. We targeted terrorists, and Pakistan targeted civilians.” In response to a question on the United States brokering the ceasefire announced on Saturday, Patra said Pakistan called for halting the fight. “The Indian DGMO received a call from his Pakistani counterpart and said there should be some kind of stoppage in such a situation.” He referred to the ceasefire as an “understanding” and said India “was not in favour of escalation.” India has reiterated its stance against terrorism and announced that any terror attack will be considered an act of war. Patra said the leadership has taken both military and non-military actions against Pakistan for masterminding and executing terror attacks in India. “Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the government of India weakened Pakistan.

2609,"After Operation Sindoor, India retains escalation dominance","The Indian armed forces successfully executed Operation Sindoor in the early hours of May 7, carrying out targeted strikes on nine “terrorist infrastructure” sites in Pakistan and Pakistan occupied Kashmir (PoK) in response to the Pahalgam terror attack on April 22. At a press briefing on the operations on May 7, government representatives said that the targets engaged were chosen based on strong intelligence inputs and their involvement in terror activities. It was also clarified that no military or civilian infrastructure of Pakistan was struck. PREMIUM The government needs to send out the larger diplomatic message that retribution for Pahalgam has been achieved and that India does not want any further escalation (PIB) The Indian government’s effort all along has been to isolate Pakistan in a multifaceted manner. The details of targets engaged and losses incurred therein have been brought out by the media and the official statements. It shall be pertinent at this juncture to carry out a review of the situation so far and what may be in the offing vis-a-vis escalation or otherwise. First, it has come out loud and clear that the red lines have been drawn again by India, to send a strong message to Pakistan. The “justice delivery”, to paraphrase foreign secretary Vikram Misri, was executed with deliberations involving various military and non-military measures, as against being an impulsive reaction to the Pahalgam attack. Operation Sindoor was several notches above the surgical strikes of 2016 and Balakot strike of 2019. The targets selected were more in number, had varied profiles, and were located as deep as 150 kilometres from the Pakistan border. Also, the strikes delivered by 24 missiles of various kinds had much wider footprints than before, including locations not only in PoK but also in Pakistan with one location across the international border (IB). This clearly has demonstrated India’s intent and resolve in defending its rights. Second, this was a joint operation with a high degree of synchronicity and was wrapped up in about 20 minutes. The employment of Rafale fighters, firing high-tech SCALP and HAMMER missiles, the employment of drones and loitering ammunitions, and the collection of accurate, real-time data for post-strike damage assessment through Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are a few facets that demonstrate our heightened capabilities. Third, the Union government fared well as far as psychological warfare was concerned, by maintaining balance through a period of immense public pressure preceding the strikes. Pressure was mounted on Pakistan by forcing its army to mobilise across its length and breadth and by keeping them guessing. Given Pakistan’s internal security situation and the state of its economy, the strain on them may facilitate quicker de-escalation. Fourth, the diplomatic initiative of keeping the international community updated on the developments concerning Pahalgam has enabled India to build a strong case for itself; a fair number of countries with global heft are on board, except a few such as China and Turkiye. Again, this is likely to be effective towards de-escalation. As far as a Pakistani retaliation to Operation Sindoor is concerned, one can reasonably be expected. The sole driving force behind such retaliation will be securing the domestic narrative. The challenge lies in the fact that, unlike India which targeted terror infrastructure, Pakistan has no similar targets in India. This shall compel the Pakistan army to hit Indian military targets, primarily adjoining the Line of Control (LoC) and IB. As always, the civilian population in proximity to the LoC or IB will bear the brunt. There have been confirmed reports of casualties of civilians in Poonch during the first 12 hours after Operation Sindoor. Pakistan will find it challenging to justify the strikes. Conventional capabilities of both militaries favour India; very likely, India will have dominance in escalation. The challenge lies in the fact that both nations are nuclear powers. The international community could weigh down on both to prevent any such step. On India’s part, the government needs to send out the larger diplomatic message that retribution for Pahalgam has been achieved and that India does not want any further escalation. Our loud message connected to precision strikes on terror infrastructure certainly underlines this intent. Domestically, in both nations, the leadership must construct or de-construct narratives that, over a period of time, have acquired jingoistic shades, as evident from social media trends. The supply in terms of what governments can deliver must dictate demand. This is warranted for peace and prosperity in the region. Otherwise, both the nations risk the chance of falling prey to the terrorists’ machinations. Once the situation gets better, drive home the lessons of accountability for Pahalgam, because lessons learned from Operation Sindoor, in the mid- and long-run, may not turn Pakistan’s terror tap off.

2610,Operation Sindoor and global outreach against terrorism,"Following Operation Sindoor, India has started a calculated diplomatic campaign to interact with the world on its uncompromising stance against terrorism. Visiting countries all throughout Asia, Africa, and West Asia, multi-party delegations under the supervision of well-known political figures strive to stress Pakistan's alleged support of terrorism and thereby promote India's zero-tolerance policy against terrorism. As India tries to rewrite its global story, this diplomatic interaction marks a pivotal change in its foreign policy and counter-terrorism approach. PREMIUM Operation Sindoor (ANI Photo) (Shrikant Singh) Operation Sindoor represented a significant change in India's reaction to cross-border terrorism. Launched in May 2025, the operation was aimed against military installations and terrorism infrastructure in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK). The outcome was a clear military operation proving India's capacity and resolve to respond against acts of terrorism. Announced by Prime Minister Modi, this operation established a new benchmark in India's war against terrorism, hence defining a new normal in India's strategic doctrine. India's diplomatic activities after Operation Sindoor are evidence of its will to secure support for its fight against terrorism. Comprising members of many political parties, the delegations are tasked with presenting a cohesive face to the world community. This multi-party strategy emphasises how widely India agrees on the threat of terrorism and the need for a coordinated worldwide response. The nations that these delegations are visiting have been chosen strategically based on their importance in the geopolitical landscape. Engaging countries in Asia, Africa, and West Asia helps India create a coalition of support across regional lines. This outreach aims to present India as a responsible global actor dedicated to peace and security in addition to refuting Pakistan's story. The recent diplomatic push by India marks a break from traditional diplomacy. It is a proactive approach aimed at interacting with the global world on India's terms. India is trying to change the world story and hold Pakistan accountable for its actions by stressing its claimed backing of terrorism. This strategy questions accepted diplomatic conventions and captures India's rising international stage assertiveness. This diplomatic step serves as evidence of India's awareness of the complexity of current geopolitics. It acknowledges that the fight against terrorism is a worldwide concern, which needs global group effort rather than just a local one. India is establishing its leadership in the global fight against terrorism by forming partnerships and encouraging collaboration. The delegation India sent to other nations after Operation Sindoor marked a significant turning point in its diplomatic history. Aimed at changing the world conversation on terrorism, it marks a new era of assertiveness and strategic involvement. India's diplomatic activity reminds us of the need for world Collaboration is essential in countering the menace of terrorism while navigating the complexities of international relations. This calculated diplomatic action seeks to present India as a conscientious global player committed to peace and security, thus refuting Pakistan's narrative. India's engagement with the global community upholds its zero-tolerance stance against terrorism, paving the way for a safer and more stable world. By visiting countries across the globe in East and Southeast Asia, Africa, West Asia, Central America, Latin America, Europe, and North America, the parliamentary delegations are building bridges between diverse cultures and perspectives. This mission is not just about addressing immediate challenges but also about laying the groundwork for medium and long term Indian diplomatic objectives. The delegations’ work provides hope in a world that often appears divided. It is a testament to the belief that, despite our differences, we can come together to create a better world for all. As we look to the future, let us draw inspiration from this diplomatic journey to fight for peace and commit to fostering a more inclusive and interconnected global community.

2617,Op Sindoor a sign India no longer bound by traditional borders: Rajnath,"Defence minister Rajnath Singh on Thursday said Operation Sindoor was a balanced military response that signalled India is no longer bound by traditional boundaries, but is using modern technology, accurate intelligence and smart military strategies to target terrorism. The success of Operation Sindoor will be celebrated at the Independence Day function at Red Fort on Friday. (PTI) “It was a clear message from India that we are tolerant, but when it comes to the safety of our people and the dignity of our country, we unite and face every challenge boldly. Operation Sindoor is a part of India’s new policy, a clear message that no matter how deep the roots of terrorism are, its complete destruction will be ensured,” Singh said in a message to soldiers on the eve of the country’s 79th Independence Day. The success of Operation Sindoor will be celebrated at the Independence Day function at Red Fort on Friday, three months after Indian forces hit terror and military targets in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied-Kashmir (PoK) in retaliation for the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack. A Mi-17 helicopter will fly a flag depicting Operation Sindoor, the invitation cards carry the operation’s distinct logo, the view cutter at Gyanpath will also showcase the logo, and the floral decoration will be based on the operation. Operation Sindoor will continue until the goal of complete destruction of terrorism is achieved, Singh said, on a day the government announced gallantry awards for soldiers who took part in the operation. Singh described India’s actions during the operation as “a shining example of a precise and successful military strategy, and a glimpse of a new vision, technological advancements and self-reliance.” India launched the operation in the early hours of May 7 and struck terror and military installations in Pakistan and PoK following the Pahalgam terror strike. Between the launch of the operation in the early hours of May 7 and the ceasefire on May 10 evening, Indian forces bombed nine terror camps in Pakistan and PoK, killing at least 100 terrorists, and the Indian Air Force struck targets at 13 Pakistani airbases and military installations. India, Singh said, successfully utilised cutting-edge apparatus such as drones, layered air defence, electronic warfare and network-centric operations, and proved that it is no longer dependent on foreign technology. The operation has taken India’s military self-reliance to a greater height, he said. Talking about the balanced strategy of Operation Sindoor, Singh said within a few minutes (on May 7), nine terror training camps, including the headquarters of Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed, were destroyed by precise missile attacks, and no civilian areas and Pakistani military establishments were targeted. The Indian armed forces, he said, neither crossed the Line of Control nor violated the international border, yet managed to deliver a crushing blow to the terror infrastructure hidden inside the enemy’s territory.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi addresses Devi Ahilyabai Mahila Sashaktikaran Mahasammelan, in Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh. (PTI) Highlighting the operation’s significance, PM Narendra Modi said, “Our armed forces demolished terror camps deep inside areas that even the Pakistani army wouldn’t have imagined. Operation Sindoor has made it clear that a proxy war through terrorists is completely unacceptable.” In a strong message to Pakistan and terror sponsors, the Prime Minister added, “We will now strike inside your territory, and those who support terrorists will also have to pay a heavy price.” Modi also linked the operation’s name to Indian tradition and woman power, saying, “Sindoor is a symbol of 'Naari Shakti' in our tradition... In Pahalgam, terrorists not only shed the blood of Indians, but they also attacked our traditions. They challenged 'Naari Shakti'. This challenge proved fatal for terrorists and their masters.” Modi's statement comes in the backdrop of the April 22 killings of civilians in Pahalgam, which triggered Operation Sindoor — a large-scale retaliatory military strike targeting terror camps in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. Before the speech, Modi took part in a ‘Mahila Sashaktikaran Maha Sammelan’ in Bhopal on the 300th birth anniversary of legendary queen Ahilyabai Holkar. During the programme at Jamboori Maidan, he also virtually inaugurated the Super Priority Corridor of Indore Metro, Datia and Satna airports and laid the foundation stone of various developmental projects. Ahilyabai Holkar, the revered queen of the Holkar dynasty in 18th-century Malwa, is remembered for her exceptional governance, commitment to social welfare, and contributions towards culture and spirituality. Modi also transferred the first instalment of 1,271 new Atal Gram Seva Sadan (Panchayat Bhawan), built at ?483 crore. The six-km-long Super Priority Corridor of Indore Metro is part of the Metro Yellow Line, which includes 5 stations. It will give Indore, the country's cleanest city, a modern, pollution-free and fast transport facility, a first in Madhya Pradesh, according to officials. The PM released a postal stamp and a ?300 commemorative coin dedicated to Ahilyabai. He also honoured the artist, who has made a significant contribution to tribal, folk and traditional arts, with the National Devi Ahilyabai Award on the occasion.",Operation Sindoor,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/operation-sindoor-indias-biggest-most-successful-anti-terror-mission-pm-narendra-modi-in-bhopal-101748676022801.html,Hindustan Times,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""tonality"", ""reason"": ""The article uses strong, positive language to describe Operation Sindoor and PM Modi's role in it, framing it as a successful and necessary response to terrorism."", ""confidence"": 0.8}"
2623,"Former army chiefs briefed on Operation Sindoor’s execution, impact","NEW DELHI: Several former army chiefs were on Tuesday briefed on different aspects of Operation Sindoor, including its execution, strategic impact and the military’s jointmanship, on the opening day of a two-day brainstorming session involving army chief General Upendra Dwivedi and his predecessors, the army said. Army chief General Upendra Dwivedi. (HT File Photo) “Being held in the aftermath of Operation Sindoor, the conclave (Chiefs’ Chintan) aims to provide a platform to leverage the institutional knowledge and experience of the former chiefs,” it said in a statement. India launched the operation in the early hours of May 7 and struck terror and military installations in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) following the Pahalgam terror strike in which 26 people were shot dead. It triggered a four-day military confrontation with Pakistan involving fighter jets, missiles, drones, long-range weapons and heavy artillery before the two sides reached an understanding on stopping all military action on May 10. A key highlight of the day was a comprehensive operational briefing on Operation Sindoor, including the synergised conduct of operations with the Indian Air Force (IAF) and navy, the army said. “The operation’s execution, strategic impact and jointmanship model were presented in detail to provide contextual understanding and invite insights from the former chiefs.” The retired chiefs present included Generals Manoj Pande, Bikram Singh, Deepak Kapoor, JJ Singh, NC Vij and VP Malik. Between the launch of the operation in the early hours of May 7 and the ceasefire on May 10 evening, Indian forces bombed nine terror camps in Pakistan and PoK and killed at least 100 terrorists. The IAF struck two terror sites at Markaz Subhanallah in Bahawalpur and Markaz Taiba near Muridke, both in Pakistan’s Punjab province, while the army hit targets at seven places, including Mehmoona Joya in Sialkot, Sawai Nala and Syed Na Bilal in Muzaffarabad, Gulpur and Abbas in Kotli, Barnala in Bhimber, and Sarjal. On May 9-10, the IAF struck military targets in Rafiqui, Murid, Chaklala, Rahim Yar Khan, Sukkur, Chunian, Pasrur, Sialkot, Skardu, Sargodha, Jacobabad, Bholari and Malir Cantt in Karachi. Later it emerged that India’s targeting of locations within Pakistan during the May 7-10 clash was more extensive than was previously known, with a Pakistani document acknowledging that Indian drones had struck locations ranging from Peshawar in the northwest to Hyderabad in the south. The graphics in the May 18 Pakistani document detailing India’s drone strikes on May 8, 9 and 10 listed seven locations --- Peshawar in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province, Attock, Bahawalnagar, Gujrat and Jhang in Punjab province, and Chhor and Hyderabad in Sindh province --- that were not acknowledged as targets by Indian officials at any briefings held during or after the hostilities. Pakistan’s Operation Bunyan-um-Marsoos, which was mounted in response to Operation Sindoor, “folded in eight hours” on May 10 belying Islamabad’s ambitious target of bringing India to its knees in 48 hours, chief of defence staff General Anil Chauhan said on June 3. Jointness among the three services --- an essential prerequisite to the creation of theatre commands --- was in focus during Operation Sindoor. The forward presence of INS Vikrant, along with its Mig-29K fighters and airborne early warning helicopters, prevented hostile aircraft from coming within several hundred kms of the carrier battle group consisting of several warships. Dwivedi underlined the importance of the former chiefs’ continued engagement in shaping the ongoing transformation and future direction of the army. The former chiefs were updated on the induction of niche technologies and modernisation initiatives aimed at enhancing the force’s operational capabilities. The topics discussed included steps being taken by the army for technology absorption, the force’s contributions to the goals of Viksit Bharat, and reforms in human resource policies and welfare initiatives for veterans.",Operation Sindoor,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/former-army-chiefs-briefed-on-operation-sindoor-s-execution-impact-101750167917673.html,Hindustan Times,"{""bias_detected"": ""yes"", ""bias_type"": ""tonality"", ""reason"": ""The article uses positive language to describe Operation Sindoor, highlighting its success and strategic impact."", ""confidence"": 0.8}"

Colonel Sofiya Qureshi stated during a press conference, “No Pakistani military facilities have been targeted. India has demonstrated considerable restraint in selection of targets and method of execution. The armed forces chose four targets in Pakistan and five in PoJK based on ""credible intelligence"" about terror camps operation under various guises. During the press conference, the Army also revealed pictures of the nine terrorist camps that were targeted and the impact of the attacks. The camp, has been linked to terrorist organisation Lashkar-e-Taiba and is considered to be its headquarters.

The facility is located just six kilometres from Jammu’s Samba sector. The Markaz Abbas camp in Kotli in Kashmir was selected because it is headed by Qari Zarar, who is wanted by the NIA, and has a presence of 100-125 JeM terrorists. Another JeM camp known as Markaz Syedna Bilal, located in Muzaffarabad, has a presence of 50-100 terrorists, and is used as a training centre for the JeM cadre. Shawai Nallah camp at Muzaffarabad in PoK is a crucial LeT camp which has been operational since 2000, The camp which can accommodate up to 250 terrorists, was also used to plan strikes. The Mehmoona Joya terror facility at Sialkot is concealed in a health centre, and is used for the infiltration of Hizbul Mujahideen terrorists into Jammu region. It is also a place for training, storing and handling weapons. The camp houses 30 terrorists. The Indian Air Force also targeted the Markaz Raheel Shahid camp at Kotli in PoK.
